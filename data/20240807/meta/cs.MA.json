        "summary": "The increase in high-dimensional multiomics data demands advanced integration\nmodels to capture the complexity of human diseases. Graph-based deep learning\nintegration models, despite their promise, struggle with small patient cohorts\nand high-dimensional features, often applying independent feature selection\nwithout modeling relationships among omics. Furthermore, conventional\ngraph-based omics models focus on homogeneous graphs, lacking multiple types of\nnodes and edges to capture diverse structures. We introduce a Heterogeneous\nGraph ATtention network for omics integration (HeteroGATomics) to improve\ncancer diagnosis. HeteroGATomics performs joint feature selection through a\nmulti-agent system, creating dedicated networks of feature and patient\nsimilarity for each omic modality. These networks are then combined into one\nheterogeneous graph for learning holistic omic-specific representations and\nintegrating predictions across modalities. Experiments on three cancer\nmultiomics datasets demonstrate HeteroGATomics' superior performance in cancer\ndiagnosis. Moreover, HeteroGATomics enhances interpretability by identifying\nimportant biomarkers contributing to the diagnosis outcomes.",

        "summary": "As global supply chains and freight volumes grow, the U.S. faces escalating\ntransportation demands. The heavy reliance on road transport, coupled with the\nunderutilization of the railway system, results in congested highways,\nprolonged transportation times, higher costs, and increased carbon emissions.\nCalifornia's San Pedro Port Complex (SPPC), the nation's busiest, incurs a\nsignificant share of these challenges. We utilize an agent-based simulation to\nreplicate real-world scenarios, focusing on the intricacies of interactions in\na modified intermodal inbound freight system for the SPPC. This involves\nrelocating container classification to potential warehouses in California,\nUtah, Arizona, and Nevada, rather than exclusively at port areas. Our primary\naim is to evaluate the proposed system's efficiency, considering cost and\nfreight throughput, while also examining the effects of workforce shortages.\nComputational analysis suggests that strategically installing intermodal\ncapabilities in select warehouses can reduce transportation costs, boost\nthroughput, and foster resour",

        "summary": "Recently, there has been increasing interest in using Large Language Models\n(LLMs) to construct complex multi-agent systems to perform tasks such as\ncompiling literature reviews, drafting consumer reports, and planning\nvacations. Many tools and libraries exist for helping create such systems,\nhowever none support recursive multi-agent systems -- where the models\nthemselves flexibly decide when to delegate tasks and how to organize their\ndelegation structure. In this work, we introduce ReDel: a toolkit for recursive\nmulti-agent systems that supports custom tool-use, delegation schemes,\nevent-based logging, and interactive replay in an easy-to-use web interface. We\nshow that, using ReDel, we are able to achieve significant performance gains on\nagentic benchmarks and easily identify potential areas of improvements through\nthe visualization and debugging tools.

        "summary": "Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods, while effective in\nzero-sum or positive-sum games, often yield suboptimal outcomes in general-sum\ngames where cooperation is essential for achieving globally optimal outcomes.\nMatrix game social dilemmas, which abstract key aspects of general-sum\ninteractions, such as cooperation, risk, and trust, fail to model the temporal\nand spatial dynamics characteristic of real-world scenarios. In response, our\nstudy extends matrix game social dilemmas into more complex, higher-dimensional\nMARL environments. We adapt a gridworld implementation of the Stag Hunt dilemma\nto more closely match the decision-space of a one-shot matrix game while also\nintroducing variable environment complexity. Our findings indicate that as\ncomplexity increases, MARL agents trained in these environments converge to\nsuboptimal strategies, consistent with the risk-dominant Nash equilibria\nstrategies found in matrix games. Our work highlights the impact of environment\ncomplexity on achieving optimal outcomes in higher-dimensional game-theoretic\nMARL environments.",
