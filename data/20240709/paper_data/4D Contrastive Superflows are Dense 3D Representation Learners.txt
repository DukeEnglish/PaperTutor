dense-to-sparse consistency regularization, which promotes insensitivity
to point cloud density variations during feature learning, and 2) a flow-

unified pipeline that emphasizes holistic representation learning from both
the structural 3D layouts and the temporal 4D information.
The strong spatiotemporal consistency regularization in SuperFlow effec-
tively forms a semantically rich landscape that enhances data representations.

To summarize, this work incorporates key contributions listed as follows:

– Our framework incorporates novel designs including view consistency align-

which better encourages data representation learning effects between cam-

– Our approach sets a new state-of-the-art performance across 11 LiDAR
datasets, exhibiting strong robustness and generalizability. We also reveal
intriguing emergent properties as we scale up the 2D and 3D backbones,
which could lay the foundation for scalable 3D perception.

LiDAR-based 3D Perception. The LiDAR sensor has been widely used in
today’s3Dperceptionsystems,creditedtoitsrobustandstructuralsensingabil-4 X. Xu et al.
ities [4,89,94]. Due to the sparse and unordered nature of LiDAR point clouds,
suitable rasterization strategies are needed to convert them into structural in-
puts [38,95]. Popular choices include sparse voxels [19,20,34,35,92,120], bird’s
eyeviewmaps[11,57,113,119],rangeviewimages[18,22,45,69,106,109,118],and
multi-view fusion [19,41,61,63,78,107,108]. While witnessing record-breaking
performances on standard benchmarks, existing approaches rely heavily on hu-
man annotations, which hinders scalability [28]. In response to this challenge,
we resort to newly appeared 3D representation learning, hoping to leverage the
richcollectionsofunlabeledLiDARpointcloudsformoreeffectivelearningfrom
LiDAR data. This could further enrich the efficacy of LiDAR-based perception.
Data-Efficient 3D Perception. To better save annotation budgets, previous
efforts seek 3D perception in a data-efficient manner [12,13,28,41,47,50]. One
line of research resorts to weak supervision, e.g., seeding points [37,54,87,117],
active prompts [39,58,102], and scribbles [96], for weakly-supervised LiDAR se-
mantic segmentation. Another line of research seeks semi-supervised learning
approaches [48,53,93] to better tackle efficient 3D scene perception and achieve
promising results. In this work, different from the prior pursuits, we tackle effi-
cient3Dperceptionfromthedatarepresentationlearningperspective.Weestab-
lish several LiDAR-based data representation learning settings that seamlessly
combinepretrainingwithweakly-andsemi-supervisedlearning,furtherenhanc-

3D Representation Learning. Analog to 2D representation learning strate-
gies [14,16,31,32,105], prior works designed contrastive [36,71,82,103,110,115],
masked modeling [33,51,97], and reconstruction [8,68] objectives for 3D pre-
training.Mostearly3Drepresentationlearningapproachesuseasinglemodality
for pretraining, leaving room for further development. The off-the-shelf calibra-
tions among different types of sensors provide a promising solution for building
pretraining objectives [64]. Recently, SLidR [83] has made the first contribution
towardmulti-modal3DrepresentationlearningbetweencameraandLiDARsen-
sors.Subsequentworks[67,75,112]extendedthisframeworkwithmoreadvanced

betterassistthecontrastivelearningacrosssensors.Puyet al.[76,77]conducted
a comprehensive study on the distillation recipe for better pretraining effects.
While these approaches have exhibited better performance than their baselines,
they overlooked the rich temporal cues across consecutive scans, which might
lead to sub-opt pretraining performance. In this work, we construct dense 3D
representation learning objectives using calibrated LiDAR sequences. Our ap-
proach encourages the consistency between features from sparse to dense inputs
and features across timestamps, yielding superiority over existing endeavors.
4D Representation Learning. Leveraging consecutive scans is promising in
extracting temporal relations [2,24,34,86]. For point cloud data pretraining,
prior works [17,65,84,85,116] mainly focused on applying 4D cues on object-
and human-centric point clouds, which are often small in scale. For large-scale
automotive point clouds, STRL [40] learns spatiotemporal data invariance with
different spatial augmentations in the point cloud sequence. TARL [72] and4D Contrastive Superflows are Dense 3D Representation Learners 5
STSSL [98] encourage similarities of point clusters in two consecutive frames,
where such clusters are obtained by ground removal and clustering algorithms,
i.e., RANSAC [26], Patchwork [56], and HDBSCAN [25]. BEVContrast [82]
sharesasimilarmotivationbututilizesBEVmapsforcontrastivelearning,which
yields a more effective implementation. The “one-fits-all” clustering parameters,
however, are often difficult to obtain, hindering existing works. Different from
existing methods that use a single modality for 4D representation learning, we
proposetoleverageLiDAR-cameracorrespondencesandsemantic-richsuperpix-
els to establish meaningful multi-modality 4D pretraining objectives.
3 SuperFlow
In this section, we first revisit the common setups of the camera-to-LiDAR dis-
tillation baseline (cf. Sec. 3.1). We then elaborate on the technical details of
SuperFlow, encompassing a straightforward yet effective view consistency align-
ment (cf. Sec. 3.2), a dense-to-sparse consistency regularization (cf. Sec. 3.3),
and a flow-based spatiotemporal contrastive learning (cf. Sec. 3.4). The overall
pipeline of the proposed SuperFlow framework is depicted in Fig. 4.
3.1 Preliminaries
Problem Definition. Given a point cloud Pt = {pt,ft|i = 1,...,N} with
i i
N points captured by a LiDAR sensor at time t, where p ∈ R3 denotes the
i
coordinate of the point and f ∈ RC is the corresponding feature, we aim to
i
transfer knowledge from M surrounding camera images It = {It|i = 1,...,M}
i
into the point cloud. Here, I ∈ RH×W×3 represents an image with height H
i
and width W. Prior works [62,83] generate a set of class-agnostic superpixels
X = {Xj|j = 1,...,V} for each image via the unsupervised SLIC algorithm [1]
i i
or the more recent vision foundation models (VFMs) [43,121,122], where V de-
notes the total number of superpixels. Assuming that the point cloud Pt and
images It are calibrated, the point cloud p =(x ,y ,z ) can be then projected
i i i i
to the image plane (u ,v ) using the following sensor calibration parameters:

[u ,v ,1]T = ×Γ ×Γ ×[x ,y ,z ]T , (1)
i i z K c←l i i i
i
where Γ denotes the camera intrinsic matrix and Γ is the transformation
K c←l
matrix from LiDAR sensors to surrounding-view cameras. We also obtain a set
of superpoints Y ={Yj|j =1,...,V} through this projection.

employ CLIP’s text encoder and fine-tune the last layer of the segmentation
head from VFMs with predefined text prompts. This allows the segmentation
head to generate language-guided semantic categories for each pixel, which we

3.3 D2S: Dense-to-Sparse Consistency Regularization

stricting the efficacy of the cross-sensor feature representation learning process.
In this work, we propose to tackle this challenge by combining multiple LiDAR

semantically rich representation for feature learning.

for Pd and Pt, respectively, using superpixels Xt. Both Pt and Pd are fed into
the weight-shared 3D network F and H for feature extraction. The output

3.4 FCL: Flow-Based Contrastive Learning
Motivation.LiDARpointcloudsareacquiredsequentially,embeddingrichdy-
namic scene information across consecutive timestamps. Prior works [62,67,83]
primarily focused on single LiDAR scans, overlooking the consistency of mov-
ing objects across scenes. To address these limitations, we propose flow-based
contrastive learning (FCL) across sequential LiDAR scenes to encourage spa-
tiotemporal consistency.
SpatialContrastiveLearning.Ourframework,depictedinFig.4,takesthree
LiDAR-camera pairs from different timestamps within a suitable time window
as input, i.e., {(Pt,It),(Pt+∆t,It+∆t),(Pt−∆t,It−∆t)}, where timestamp t de-

Flow-Based Contrastive Learning. The spatial contrastive learning objec-
tive between images and point clouds, as depicted in Eq. (4), fails to ensure
thatmovingobjectssharesimilarattributesacrossdifferentscenes.Tomaintain
consistency across scenes, a temporal consistency loss is introduced among su-
perpointfeaturesacrossdifferentscenes.ForthepointcloudsPt andPt+∆t,the
corresponding superpoint features Qt and Qt+∆t are obtained via their super-
points. The temporal contrastive loss operates on Qt and Qt+∆t:

weemployMinkUNet[20]asthe3DbackboneandDINOv2[73](withViTback-

(B), and large (L). Following Seal [62], OpenSeeD [111] is used to generate se-
mantic superpixels. The framework is pretrained end-to-end on 600 scenes from
nuScenes [27], then linear probed and fine-tuned on nuScenes [27] according to
the data splits in SLidR [83]. The domain generalization study adheres to the
same configurations as Seal [62] for the other ten datasets. Both the baselines

utilizing the AdamW optimizer [66] and OneCycle scheduler [88]. Due to space
limits, kindly refer to the Appendix for additional implementation details.

to the fact that models with limited parameters are less effective in capturing
patternsduringrepresentationlearning,and,conversely,modelswithalargeset
of trainable parameters tend to be difficult to converge.
Representation Density. The consistency regularization between sparse and
dense point clouds encourages useful representation learning. To analyze the
degree of regularization, we investigate various point cloud densities and show
the results in Tab. 4. We observe that a suitable point cloud density can im-
prove the model’s ability to feature representation. When the density of point
clouds is too dense, the motion of objects is obvious in the scene. However, we
generate superpoints of the dense points based on superpixels captured at the
timeofsparsepoints.Thedisplacementdifferenceofdynamicobjectsmakesthe
projection misalignment. A trade-off selection would be two or three sweeps.
Temporal Consistency. The ability to capture semantically coherent tempo-
ral cues is crucial in our SuperFlow framework. In Eq. (5), we operate temporal
contrastive learning on superpoints features across scenes. As shown in Tab. 7,
we observe that temporal contrastive learning achieves better results compared
to single-frame methods. We also compare the impact of frames used to capture
temporal cues. When we use 3 frames, it acquires more context-aware informa-
tion than 2 frames and achieves better results. Finally, we study the impact of
the timespan between frames. The performance will drop with a longer times-
pan. We conjecture that scenes with short timespans have more consistency,
while long timespans tend to have more uncertain factors.
Component Analysis. In Tab. 6, we analyze each component in the Super-
Flow framework,including viewconsistency,dense-to-sparse regularization,and
flow-based contrastive learning. The baseline is SLiDR [83] with VFMs-based
superpixels. View consistency brings slight improvements among the popular
datasets with a few annotations. D2S distills dense features into sparse features
and it brings about 1% mIoU gains. FCL extracts temporal cues via temporal
contrastive learning and it significantly leads to about 2.0% mIoU gains.

tation ability of our pretrained model. The query points include “car”, “man-14 X. Xu et al.

shows strong semantic discriminative ability without fine-tuning. We conjec-
ture that it comes from three aspects: 1) View consistent superpixels enable the
network to learn semantic representation; 2) Dense-to-sparse regularization en-
hances the network to learn varying density features; 3) Temporal contrastive
learning extracts semantic cues across scenes.
5 Conclusion
In this work, we presented SuperFlow to tackle the challenging 3D data rep-
resentation learning. Motivated by the sequential nature of LiDAR acquisitions,
weproposedthreenoveldesignstobetterencouragespatiotemporalconsistency,
encompassing view consistency alignment, dense-to-sparse regularization, and
flow-based contrastive learning. Extensive experiments across 11 diverse LiDAR
datasets showed that SuperFlow consistently outperforms prior approaches in
linear probing, downstream fine-tuning, and robustness probing. Our study on
scaling up 2D and 3D network capacities reveals insightful findings. We hope
this work could shed light on future designs of powerful 3D foundation models.4D Contrastive Superflows are Dense 3D Representation Learners 15

following the data split in SLidR [83]. Specifically, 600 scenes are used as the
training set for model pretraining, which is a mini-train split of the whole 700

Linear Probing. We train the 3D backbone network with the fixed pretrained
backbone on the training set of nuScenes [27], and evaluate the performance on
the validation set. It consists of 700 training scenes (for 29,130 samples) and
150 validation scenes (for 6,019 samples). Following the conventional setup, the
evaluation results are calculated among 16 merged semantic categories.
Downstream Fine-Tuning. To validate the pretraining quality of each self-
supervised learning approach, we conduct a comprehensive downstream fine-
tuning experiment on the nuScenes [27] dataset, with various configurations.
Specifically, we train the 3D backbone network with the pretrained backbone
using 1%, 5%, 10%, 25%, and 100% annotated data, respectively, and evaluate
the model’s performance on the official validation set.
Cross-DomainFine-Tuning.Inthiswork,weconductacomprehensivecross-
domain fine-tuning experiment on a total of 9 datasets. Tab. 8 provides a sum-
mary of these datasets. Specifically, SemanticKITTI [5] and Waymo Open [90]
contain large-scale LiDAR scans collected from real-world driving scenes, which
are acquired by 64-beam LiDAR sensors. We construct the 1% training sample

shares the same scene with SemanticKITTI [5] but are weakly annotated with
line scribbles. The total percentage of valid annotated labels is 8.06% com-
pared to fully-supervised methods, while saving about 90% annotation times.
RELLIS-3D [42] is a multimodal dataset collected in an off-road environment.
It contains 13,556 annotated LiDAR scans, which present challenges to class
imbalance and environmental topography. SemanticPOSS [74] is a small-scale

for training, 250 scans for validation, and 500 scans for testing. SynLiDAR [99],
Synth4D [81], and DAPS-3D [44] are synthetic datasets captured from various
simulators. SynLiDAR [99] contains 13 LiDAR sequences with totally 198,396
samples. Synth4D [81] includes two subsets and we use Synth4D-nuScenes in
this work. It comprises of 20,000 point clouds captured in different scenarios,
including town, highway, rural area, and city. DAPS-3D includes two subsets
and we use DAPS-1, which is semi-synthetic with larger scale in this work. It
contains 11 sequences with about 23,000 LiDAR scans.
Out-of-Distribution Robustness Evaluation. In this work, we conduct a
comprehensive out-of-distribution (OoD) robustness evaluation experiment on
the nuScenes-C dataset from the Robo3D [46] benchmark. As shown in Tab. 9,
there are a total of 8 OoD scenarios in the nuScenes-C dataset, including “fog”,
“wet ground”, “snow”, “motion blur”, “beam missing”, “crosstalk”, “incomplete
echo”, and “cross sensor”. Each scenario is further split into three levels (“light”,

7 Additional Quantitative Result
In this section, we supplement the complete results (i.e., the class-wise LiDAR
semantic segmentation results) to better support the findings and conclusions
drawn in the main body of this paper.4D Contrastive Superflows are Dense 3D Representation Learners 19
7.1 Class-Wise Linear Probing Results
We present the class-wise IoU scores for the linear probing experiments in
Tab. 10. We also implement PPKT [64], SLidR [83], and Seal [62] with the
distillation of ViT-S, ViT-B, and ViT-L. The results show that SuperFlow out-
performs state-of-the-art pretraining methods significantly for most semantic
classes. Some notably improved classes are: “barrier”, “bus”, “traffic cone”, and
“terrain”. Additionally, we observe a consistent trend of performance improve-
ments using larger models for the cross-sensor distillation.
7.2 Class-Wise Fine-Tuning Results
We present the class-wise IoU scores for the 1% fine-tuning experiments in
Tab. 11. We observe that a holistic improvement brought by SuperFlow com-
pared to state-of-the-art pretraining methods.
8 Additional Qualitative Result
In this section, we provide additional qualitative examples to help visually com-
pare different approaches presented in the main body of this paper.
8.1 LiDAR Segmentation Results
We provide additional qualitative assessments in Fig. 7, Fig. 8, and Fig. 9. The
resultsverifyagainthesuperiorityofSuperFlowoverpriorpretrainingmethods.
8.2 Cosine Similarity Results
We provide additional cosine similarity maps in Fig. 10 and Fig. 11. The results
consistently verify the efficacy of SuperFlow in learning meaningful representa-
tions during flow-based spatiotemporal contrastive learning.
9 Limitation and Discussion
In this section, we elaborate on the limitations and potential negative societal
impact of this work.
9.1 Potential Limitations
Although SuperFlow holistically improves the image-to-LiDAR self-supervised
learning efficacy, there are still rooms for further explorations.20 X. Xu et al.
DynamicObjects.Asshownin
Fig. 12, dynamic objects across
frames may share different su-
perpixels due to variant scales in
the images. The objects across
frames will be regarded as neg-
ative samples, which will cause
“temporalconflict” undertempo-
𝑡𝑡F−ig∆.𝑡𝑡12: Possible 𝑡𝑡temporal confl 𝑡𝑡i +cts ∆. 𝑡𝑡
ral contrastive learning.
Mis-Align Between LiDAR and Cameras. The calibration parameters be-
tween LiDAR and cameras are not perfect as they work at different frequencies.
This will cause possible misalignment between superpoints and superpixels, es-
pecially when using dense point clouds to distill sparse point clouds. This also
restricts the scalability to form much denser points from sweep points.
9.2 Potential Societal Impact
LiDAR systems can capture detailed 3D images of environments, potentially
including private spaces or sensitive information. If not properly managed, this
could lead to privacy intrusions, as individuals might be identifiable from the
data collected, especially when combined with other data sources. Additionally,
dependenceonautomatedsystemsthatuseLiDARsemanticsegmentationcould
lead to overreliance and trust in technology, potentially causing safety issues
if the systems fail or make incorrect decisions. This is particularly critical in
applications involving human safety.
