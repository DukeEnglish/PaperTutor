        "summary": "The problem of finite/fixed-time cooperative state estimation is considered\nfor a class of quasilinear systems with nonlinearities satisfying a H\\\"older\ncondition. A strongly connected nonlinear distributed observer is designed\nunder the assumption of global observability. By proper parameter tuning with\nlinear matrix inequalities, the observer error equation possesses\nfinite/fixed-time stability in the perturbation-free case and input-to-state\nstability with respect to bounded perturbations. Numerical simulations are\nperformed to validate this design.",

        "summary": "City road infrastructure is a public good, and over-consumption by\nself-interested, rational individuals leads to traffic jams. Congestion pricing\nis effective in reducing demand to sustainable levels, but also controversial,\nas it introduces equity issues and systematically discriminates lower-income\ngroups. Karma is a non-monetary, fair, and efficient resource allocation\nmechanism, that employs an artificial currency different from money, that\nincentivizes cooperation amongst selfish individuals, and achieves a balance\nbetween giving and taking. Where money does not do its job, Karma achieves\nsocially more desirable resource allocations by being aligned with consumers'\nneeds rather than their financial power. This work highlights the value\nproposition of Karma, gives guidance on important Karma mechanism design\nelements, and equips the reader with a useful software framework to model Karma\neconomies and predict consumers' behaviour. A case study demonstrates the\npotential of this feasible alternative to money, without the burden of\nadditional fees.",

        "summary": "Sensor network localization (SNL) is a challenging problem due to its\ninherent non-convexity and the effects of noise in inter-node ranging\nmeasurements and anchor node position. We formulate a non-convex SNL problem as\na multi-player non-convex potential game and investigate the existence and\nuniqueness of a Nash equilibrium (NE) in both the ideal setting without\nmeasurement noise and the practical setting with measurement noise. We first\nshow that the NE exists and is unique in the noiseless case, and corresponds to\nthe precise network localization. Then, we study the SNL for the case with\nerrors affecting the anchor node position and the inter-node distance\nmeasurements. Specifically, we establish that in case these errors are\nsufficiently small, the NE exists and is unique. It is shown that the NE is an\napproximate solution to the SNL problem, and that the position errors can be\nquantified accordingly. Based on these findings, we apply the results to case\nstudies involving only inter-node distance measurement errors and only anchor\nposition information inaccuracies.",

        "summary": "As large language models (LLMs) start interacting with each other and\ngenerating an increasing amount of text online, it becomes crucial to better\nunderstand how information is transformed as it passes from one LLM to the\nnext. While significant research has examined individual LLM behaviors,\nexisting studies have largely overlooked the collective behaviors and\ninformation distortions arising from iterated LLM interactions. Small biases,\nnegligible at the single output level, risk being amplified in iterated\ninteractions, potentially leading the content to evolve towards attractor\nstates. In a series of telephone game experiments, we apply a transmission\nchain design borrowed from the human cultural evolution literature: LLM agents\niteratively receive, produce, and transmit texts from the previous to the next\nagent in the chain. By tracking the evolution of text toxicity, positivity,\ndifficulty, and length across transmission chains, we uncover the existence of\nbiases and attractors, and study their dependence on the initial text, the\ninstructions, language model, and model size. For instance, we find that more\nopen-ended instructions lead to stronger attraction effects compared to more\nconstrained tasks. We also find that different text properties display\ndifferent sensitivity to attraction effects, with toxicity leading to stronger\nattractors than length. These findings highlight the importance of accounting\nfor multi-step transmission dynamics and represent a first step towards a more\ncomprehensive understanding of LLM cultural dynamics.",

        "summary": "Prior research has enhanced the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to\nsolve logic puzzles using techniques such as chain-of-thought prompting or\nintroducing a symbolic representation. These frameworks are still usually\ninsufficient to solve complicated logical problems, such as Zebra puzzles, due\nto the inherent complexity of translating natural language clues into logical\nstatements. We introduce a multi-agent system, ZPS, that integrates LLMs with\nan off the shelf theorem prover. This system tackles the complex puzzle-solving\ntask by breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable parts, generating\nSMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) code to solve them with a theorem prover,\nand using feedback between the agents to repeatedly improve their answers. We\nalso introduce an automated grid puzzle grader to assess the correctness of our\npuzzle solutions and show that the automated grader is reliable by evaluating\nit in a user-study. Our approach shows improvement in all three LLMs we tested,\nwith GPT-4 showing 166% improvement in the number of fully correct solutions.",
