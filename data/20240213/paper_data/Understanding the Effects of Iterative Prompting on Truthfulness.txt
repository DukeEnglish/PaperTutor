1 Introduction
The advent and rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a profound shift in the
artificial intelligence landscape [1, 2]. These models, distinguished by their significant learning capabilities,
have demonstrated exceptional aptitude in generating coherent and contextually relevant text[3]. This
prowesshasrenderedtheminvaluableacrossdiversesectors,includingfinance,healthcare,andautonomous
systems, revolutionizing conventional approaches to tasks in these domains [4–7]. Nevertheless, the advent
of LLMs into various societal aspects has also heightened the scrutiny of their reliability, especially the
integrity of their generated content [8].
Amidst their impressive feats, LLMs’ consistency in delivering accurate and verifiable information
remains a pertinent concern [9, 10]. Instances of models producing misleading information or showcasing
unwarranted confidence in incorrect outputs have underscored the imperative for ensuring the veracity
of LLM outputs, notably in critical sectors where precision and factual accuracy are non-negotiable [11].
The phenomenon of “hallucination,” wherein models fabricate information, has catalyzed the urgency to
amplify the truthfulness of LLMs, positioning it as a pivotal research focus with substantial implications
on future model refinement and application [12].

for LLMs, and (2) Iterative Prompting: Re-prompting the LLM with its response for self-assessment and
improvement. Ideally, we would like the model to correct its response post iterative promptings.
The goal to improve truthfulness has led to the development of various methodologies, among which
iterative prompting emerges as a prominent approach [13, 14]. This strategy engages the model with
sequentially structured prompts or a diversity of questions aimed at incrementally refining the model’s
initial responses [15]. Despite prior explorations into iterative prompting, its efficacy and consequences are
not unequivocally established, stirring debates and inquiries into its impact on model truthfulness[16].
Specifically, the endeavor to ascertain whether iterative prompting invariably augments truthfulness or,
under certain circumstances, predisposes models to fabricate responses, bears significant relevance [14].
Our inquiry is poised to delve into the nuanced interplay between iterative prompting and LLM
truthfulness. By methodically evaluating diverse prompting techniques, we aim to understand the intricate
dynamics governing the accuracy and calibration of model responses under iterative prompting scenarios,
addressing the critical calibration aspect that has been previously underexplored [13].

on LLM truthfulness:
• We identified a marked decline in LLM response accuracy due to naive iterative prompting, underlining
the limitations of basic iterative strategies.
• Our research exposed a pattern of apologetic responses from LLMs following iterative prompts, leading
to reduced truthfulness.
• We demonstrated that naive iterative prompting significantly increases the calibration error of LLMs,
resulting in overconfidence and diminished truthfulness.
• Building on the insights from previous points, we devised several prompt variants which substantially
improve LLM truthfulness and calibration compared to naive prompting.
• Our devised prompting variants not only address the decline in truthfulness associated with naive
prompting but also surpass established iterative prompting techniques.

Truthfulness of LLMs. In the field of Large Language Models (LLMs), ensuring the authenticity of
generated content has become a central focus. Researchers have made significant strides in this area,
employing innovative techniques to enhance model truthfulness. For instance, studies have demonstrated
the potential of analyzing an LLM’s internal state to accurately gauge the truthfulness of its outputs,
2highlighting a promising direction for enhancing reliability [17]. Another noteworthy approach involves the
application of Inference-Time Intervention (ITI), which has shown considerable success in improving the
truthfulness of model responses, marking a leap forward in model accuracy [18]. Furthermore, innovative
decoding strategies that contrast different layers within a model have proven effective in reducing
inaccuracies and hallucinations, contributing to the overall factual consistency of model-generated content
[19]. The concept of clustering text generation patterns into personas has also been explored, offering
insights into how models can discern truth from falsehood in complex data scenarios [20]. Moreover,
the introduction of benchmarks for evaluating model trustworthiness, including aspects of truthfulness,
provides a comprehensive framework for assessing and comparing the performance of various LLMs,
paving the way for more trustworthy AI systems [21]. Collectively, these efforts represent significant
advancements in the pursuit of creating LLMs that generate more truthful and reliable content, but lacks
in deeper understanding of how such mechanism might be affecting truthfulness of model responses.
Self-Improvement in LLMs. The pursuit of self-improvement in Large Language Models (LLMs)
encapsulatesadiverserangeofstrategiesdesignedtorefinetheiraccuracy,trustworthiness,andoperational
efficiency. Innovative techniques such as automated feedback strategies [22], ensemble feedback and Pareto
optimal self-supervision [23, 24], and iterative refinement methods [25, 26] have shown promise. However,
the capacity for self-correction is not inherent in all models. The study by Huang et al. [16] and research
by Krishna [27] highlight that LLMs may struggle to self-correct without external inputs, and their
performancecandegradepostself-correction.Despitethesechallenges,advancementsinself-correctionand
validation techniques [28, 29], coupled with frameworks for self-alignment [30], reflect the comprehensive
approaches being explored to bolster the performance and reliability of LLMs. However, there hasn’t been
any dedicated analysis on understanding the effects of these self-improvement methods, which we provide
in this work in the context of model truthfulness.
3 Iterative Prompting
The concept of iterative prompting allows an LLM to refine its response through a multi-step process
[26,31].Thismethoddrawsinspirationfromvariousstudiesinpsychologyandrelatedfieldsthatemphasize
the advantages of feedback-based learning [32–35]. Iterative prompting comprises two primary stages: (1)
Start Prompt and (2) Iteration Prompt, as shown in Figure 1. These two stages are described below
in more detail.
Start Prompt.ThisstageinitiatestheinteractionwiththeLLM,presentingthetasktobecompleted.
It delineates the expected approach for task resolution, which might involve incremental reasoning or the
application of a few-shot learning framework. A test sample is integrated into the prompt for the LLM to
produce its initial prediction. This process is akin to the single-prompt strategy observed in non-iterative
prompting models [36, 37]. In this work, the start prompt essentially comprises the factual questions posed
to the LLM in order to elicit accurate responses.
Iteration Prompt. In this phase, the LLM is confronted with the start prompt and its previous
response. The goal is for the LLM to re-evaluate and improve its initial solution. Numerous versions of
iterative prompting have been explored in prior research, ranging from those that incorporate human-
generated feedback [26] to entirely LLM-centric methods. Our study concentrates on iterative prompting
that necessitates minimal human intervention, permitting the LLM to independently assess and refine
its response. This iterative prompting is repeated N times, enabling an evaluation of the enhancements
associated with the increasing iterations, as depicted in Figure 1. We experiment with different variants of
iteration prompts to study its effects on the truthfulness of LLM responses.

TruthfulQA[11], which serves as a benchmark designed to evaluate the truthfulness of LLM responses.

and politics. These questions are strategically formulated to induce false answers from some individuals,
driven by prevalent misconceptions or false beliefs. For effective performance, it is imperative for LLMs to
steer clear of replicating inaccuracies commonly found in human-generated texts. For our experiments, we
focused on the multiple-choice test samples of TruthfulQA in which there is only one correct answer out
of all the provided options (named mc1_targets in [38]).
Large Language Model. We experimented with OpenAI GPT-3.5 [39] for all our experiments,
named as gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613 for API endpoint.
Implementation Details. To understand the impact of iterative prompting on the truthfulness of
LLMs, we iteratively prompt the model using various strategies for 10 iterations, aiming to discern the
trend in performance with increasing number of prompt iterations. We set the temperature of temperature
sampling to 1.0 to allow for sufficient exploration, commonly employed in setups related to truthfulness
[13]. For the calibration analysis, we employ ten bins and utilize the standard definition of Expected
Calibration Error (ECE), as defined in [40], to calculate the calibration error. We compute confidence of
the prediction by using the logprobs returned for the answer token by the OpenAI API reponse, similar to
the setup used in [41, 42]. Prompt Design: We employ the standard conversation-style prompt design,
as depicted in Figure 2. In this design, [Start Prompt] and [Iteration Prompt] are substituted with various
prompt variants utilized in the experiment.

methods, we also compare conventional baselines: (1) Random selection, where answers are generated by
sampling from LLM responses at a temperature of 1.0, and (2) Greedy selection, which generates answers
by choosing the most probable LLM response.

5 Results
5.1 Effects of Naive Iterative Prompting
Our investigation into the impact of repeated prompting on truthfulness began with naive prompting,
where iteration prompt was set to "Are you sure?", echoing the self-critique prompts used by Laban
et al. [44]. Figure 3 illustrates a significant accuracy drop after just one iteration, plummeting from
approximately 70% to around 45% (refer to Figure A8a). Delving deeper, we examined the flips, noting

that the proportion of incorrect flips (approximately 32.5%), where a correct response in iteration i-1
changed to an incorrect one in iteration i, was substantially higher than that of correct flips (about 12.5%)
(see Figure A8b). These findings align with previous studies that report a decrease in accuracy when
models are prompted to "re-think" [27, 44]. In this study, we further explored potential causes for this
decline. We observed that the LLM frequently began responses with "I apologize for the error." following
the question "Are you sure?" or a similar iterative prompt. This pattern makes sense when the model
corrects an actual mistake, but it was consistently observed across all iterations.
To gain more insight into this behavior, we analyzed the LLM’s calibration under iterative prompting
[45].Largelanguagemodelsareusuallywell-calibrated[46].Inthecontextoftruthfulness,wenotedaspike
in calibration error when the LLM re-evaluated its response, as shown in Figure 4, rising from 0.17 to 0.30.
We also graphed calibration for each bin in Figure 3c, observing that the LLM consistently fell into the
"over-confident" category (below the perfectly calibrated line), becoming increasingly overconfident with
more prompting iterations. This could be due to findings suggesting that RLHF leads to poor calibration
and sycophantic behavior [47]. Therefore, when re-evaluating its response, the LLM often starts with an
apology, leading to a change in response and a tendency to flip to incorrect answers, despite the initial
response being correct. This pattern explains why accuracy remains low through iterations (around 45%
in Figure A8a), as once it generates a set of incorrect responses in each iteration, the subsequent response
is also likely incorrect, akin to few-shot prompting but with incorrect labels. This trend of diminished
performance may also relate to the inherent recency bias in LLMs; if the tokens near the answer prediction
contain incorrect previous responses, the prediction is likely to be incorrect, a phenomenon also noted
by Zhao et al. [48]. The evidence suggests that the decrease in truthfulness may be linked to the LLM’s
immediate apology upon being asked to rethink its response. A potential remedy could involve altering the
iterative prompt to discourage the LLM from starting with an apology. A specific example of an apology
leading to a change in response from correct to incorrect is shown in Figure 5.

This makes these variants suitable candidates for further experimentation to determine if the decline
in performance is indeed due to the sycophantic behavior of the LLMs. When comparing the accuracy
of these variants against the naive prompting method, we noticed a significant difference in the trends.
Both Improved Prompt-1 and Improved Prompt-2 showed no decline in performance compared to naive
prompting, as shown in Figure 6a. Not only did the accuracies for Improved Prompt-1 and Improved
Prompt-2 not decline, but there was also a significant improvement in accuracy with increasing iterations,

from 68.7% to 73.7% for Improved Prompt-2 and from 69.1% to 74.2% for Improved Prompt-1. Upon
further examination of the incorrect flips, we observed that Improved Prompt-1 and Improved Prompt-2
had a significantly lower proportion of incorrect flips compared to naive prompting. This is why there
wasn’t a sudden decline in accuracy after the first iteration, as shown in Figure 6b. Further analysis of
the calibration of LLM through iterations revealed that the LLM calibration did not drastically worsen
through iterations, as the relative difference in ECE remained significantly lower compared to the spike in
ECE for naive prompting, as shown in Figure 7. These results suggest strong correlations between the
model’s sycophancy and poor truthfulness in LLMs. If we can reduce this sycophantic behavior through
changes in prompting, there is also the possibility of improved performance in truthfulness with increasing
iterations.AnexampleofresponsesfromImprovedPrompt-1andImprovedPrompt-2isdepictedinFigure
11 and Figure 12, respectively.
5.3 Comparison Against Other Iterative Prompting
In addition to comparing with the naive prompting method, we also evaluated the truthfulness of the
improved prompt against other state-of-the-art iterative prompting methods such as Self-Consistency[43]
and Universal Self-Consistency [13]. These methods are based on prompting LLMs multiple times to select
the most consistent response among all the responses. Beyond these baselines, we experimented with
random sampling and greedy sampling response selection strategies. We conducted experiments with these
baselines for different numbers of promptings, ranging from 1 to 10, and compared their performance
against Improved Prompt-1 and Improved Prompt-2. We observed that, unlike naive iterative prompting,
therewasnosignificantdeclineintruthfulness,asshowninFigure8.However,wealsonotedthatimproved
prompting strategies (Improved Prompt-1 and Improved Prompt-2) appeared to perform better than the
existing baselines with Improved Prompt-1 performing the best with an accuracy of ∼73% compared to
∼66% (Self-Consistency) and ∼62.6% (Universal Self-Consistency). We did not observe any apologies in
any of the responses of the baselines, which further confirms our hypothesis that the presence of excessive
apology, potentially originating from the sycophantic behavior of the LLMs, leads to a severe decline in
model truthfulness. In addition to accuracy improvements, we observed that Improved Prompt-2 had a

much lower ECE (relative difference) with Improved Prompt-1 being comparable to the baselines and
much lower than U-Self-Consistency, as shown in Figure 10 and Figure 9. This suggests that prompts
with fewer chances to respond with excessive apologies might not only mitigate the issues with declining
truthfulness but also help in providing improved performance over existing baselines.
5.4 Prompt Sensitivity
While our results in the previous sections were based solely on a selected set of prompts, we conducted the
same analysis on several rephrases of each prompt category to further confirm the generalization of these
patterns observed in previous sections. Essentially, we attempted several other versions of the iteration
promptforeachvariantandplottedallthemetricsthatweanalyzedintheprevioussections,i.e.,accuracy
on TruthfulQA, ECE, calibration, and flips. Based on our analysis in Appendix A.1 and Appendix A.2,
where we provide plots for every prompt variation we attempted, we observed the same pattern for naive
and improved iteration prompts. Specifically, the accuracy for naive prompts significantly dropped (with a
significant increase in ECE), which remained lower for the variations we attempted for improved prompts.
However, it is important to note that our analysis is based on a limited set of prompts (and designs) where
we observed consistency in findings. We believe that there could be changes in the patterns mentioned
above due to the inherent sensitivity of LLM responses based on prompt designs[50, 51].
6 Conclusion
In this work, we examined the effects of iterative prompting on the truthfulness of LLMs. Our findings
reveal that naive iterative prompts often lead to a decrease in model accuracy and an increase in
untruthful responses, primarily due to the model’s tendency towards apologetic and subsequently incorrect
answers. This phenomenon led to increased calibration errors, fostering overconfidence and compromising
truthfulness. However, our introduction of tailored prompts, Improved Prompt-1 and Improved Prompt-2,
effectively countered this trend. These prompt variations not only mitigated the decline in truthfulness

induced by naive prompting but also significantly outperformed established iterative prompting methods
in terms of accuracy and calibration. This research underscores the critical importance of promptdesign in
enhancing LLM reliability and indicates that reducing sycophantic tendencies in LLMs is key to achieving
more truthful and dependable model responses.
12Broader Impact
The broader impact of our work on the effectiveness of iterative prompting in enhancing the truthfulness
of Large Language Models (LLMs) extends beyond our technical contribution, touching upon significant
ethicalconsiderationsandsocietalimplicationsofdeployingLLMsinreal-worldapplications.Byadvancing
the understanding of how iterative prompting influences LLM reliability, our research contributes to
developing prompting techniques that generate accurate LLM responses and are ethically responsible.
Our exploratory study addresses critical concerns regarding the generation of misinformation and the
ethical use of LLMs, promoting the development of LLMs with a greater assurance of their outputs’
truthfulness. While our study primarily focuses on improving the factual accuracy of LLM responses, it
also underscores the importance of developing LLMs such that they are aware of their ethical and societal
impact, advocating for a cautious and informed approach to the evolution of LLMs.

17Appendix A Additional Results
A.1 Variants of Naive Iterative Prompting
To further understand the generalization of patterns mentioned in our findings, we also examined a few
other variants of the prompt strategies, aside from the naive iterative prompting which uses the iteration
prompt, "Are you sure?". We experimented with two other iteration prompt variations: (1) Self-corrective
Iteration Prompt [27] (Naive Iterative Prompt - 2): "Evaluate the facts behind your answer. If it is not
entirely accurate, make the necessary adjustments. If no errors are detected, maintain your initial response.
Choose the accurate option and present the final answer after ’A: The correct option is’." and (2) Explicit
mentionaboutself-improvementasatask(NaiveIterativePrompt-3):"In a broader psychological context,
self-correction refers to the process where a person makes an error and adjusts it immediately. This process
is essential for recognizing and correcting negative aspects of one’s personality to become socially acceptable.
Use this process and think more to improve your answer, and present the final answer following ’A: The
correct option is’.". The results for these two variants are shown in Figures A1 (Accuracy), Figure A3
(Calibration), Figure A4 (ECE), and Figure A2 (Flips). We don’t observe any significant differences in
patterns mentioned for the first case of naive prompting (i.e with iteration prompt as "Are you sure?").

A.2 Variants of Improved Iterative Prompting
Similar to the previous section, we also tried a few other variants of Improved Prompt-2 where we provide
more explicit instructions to perform a task. We tried two other variants: (1) Improved Prompt-3 :
[Question] Explain the reason why your answer is correct. If the answer is not correct then start with
’After further investigation’. Present the answer after ’The correct option is’. and (2) Improved Prompt-4:
[Question] ’Think and extract more facts beyond those mentioned in the previous responses, then list them
under the ’Facts’ section. Use all these facts to provide the final answer following ’A: The correct option
is’. The results for these two variants are shown in Figures A5 (Accuracy), Figure A7 (Calibration), Figure
A8 (ECE), and Figure A6 (Flips). We don’t observe any significant differences in patterns mentioned for
the first case of Improved Prompt-2.
