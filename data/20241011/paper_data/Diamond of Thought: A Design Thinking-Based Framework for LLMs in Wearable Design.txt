11 INTRODUCTION
The emerging field of wearable design is recognised as an interdisciplinary domain, bridging engineering, human
factors, and human-computer interactions (HCI) [1]. Although each discipline contributes valuable knowledge, not all
wearable computing projects involve a stable interdisciplinary team [2]. This lack of cross-disciplinary expertise often
leads tothe failure of wearabledesigns.
Advancements in technology and increases in the processing capacity of artificial intelligence have allowed large
language models (LLMs) to achieve notable success in natural language processing and have engendered innovations
in other domains. In the design field, LLMs can understand design problems, integrate interdisciplinary knowledge, and
generate textual solutions. They excel at synthesising information from diverse sources and disciplines, offering a
promising approach for integrating interdisciplinary knowledge into the design process. Many studies have begun to
explore the application of LLMs in design [3, 4, 5] by combining these models with generative design techniques to
facilitatethe creation of moreinnovative solutions.
We propose the Diamond of Thought (DoT) as a framework for actively solving concept design tasks with LLMs,
focusing specifically on its potential applications within the domain of wearable design. We posit that this method
could evolve LLMs into a sophisticated conceptual design tool with superior problem-solving and information
integration capabilities. Design-thinking principles and standard methodologies for addressing design challenges serve
as the foundation of our work.We aligned the divergent and convergentstructures requiredat each stageof the design
task to complete the generation and selection of nodes at various levels. Concurrently, adopting a body-centric
perspective, we collected and analysed 1,603 wearable prototypes and 1,129 wearable products and coded them by
function, behaviour, and structure. This comprehensive analysis resulted in an extensive wearable technology database
[6] encompassing a broad and interdisciplinary range of knowledge related to technology, functionality, and the human
body from past wearable design cases. We employed retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to input database details
into the LLMs in steps, affording them the ability to manage wearable design challenges and incorporate embodied
cognitioninto thedesign process.
To assess the effectiveness of the proposed methods, we conducted a conceptual design experiment comparing
LLMs with human designers to thoroughly evaluate their abilities, strengths, and overall performance. The results
indicate that our newly proposed DoT framework, combined with our overall methods, allows LLMs to effectively
integratepastcases and knowledgetogeneraterational and comprehensivewearabledesign solutions.
2 RELATEDWORK
2.1 Wearabledesign
Wearable devices are defined as any form of miniature electronic or sensor technology worn on the body [7]. In
recent years, the use of wearable technology has significantly increased. Devices such as smartphones, activity
2trackers, and smart watches are widely used and seem to have become almost inseparable from the human body [8].
The field of wearable technologies is recognised as an interdisciplinary domain, with existing literature spanning many
disciplines, including engineering, social sciences, and health sciences [9]. Previous research suggests that, if designed
effectively, wearable devices can leverage cultural, social, and sociological factors, as well as the diverse meanings of
the body, in conjunction with the features of smart and programmable elements [10]. Joseph et al. proposed that
wearable device design should be approached from the perspectives of fashion theory, somatics, and digital
materialities [1]. However, interdisciplinary expertise is often lacking in the current design process [2]. Collaboration
between disciplines is challenging, and designers with a single background may lack the comprehensive
interdisciplinary knowledge required for effective integration [11]. Support from diverse experts is essential to enhance
problem-solving success.
Moreover, the discourse on wearable technologies and informed use of HCI design methods have predominantly
followed scientific paradigms [1]. Such approaches analysed wearable devices from a third-person perspective, viewing
them as autonomous material objects placed on the body, containers for body quantification data, or tools for
achieving specific human objectives [12]. Thisanalytical perspective, grounded in mind-body dualism, tends to overlook
the unique characteristics of wearable devices. Thus, conventional approaches may yield devices that are not
effectivelyintegrated withthehuman body, consequentlyincreasing the usabilitythreshold [6].
2.2 LLMs
Advancements in LLMs have illuminated the path towards artificial general intelligence, with notable examples
including generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) [13, 14], LLaMA4 [15], and Geminis [16]. Because they have
demonstrated capabilities close to the human level on tasks of understanding natural language, text generation, and
reasoning, LLMs have extensive applications in various fields, such as medicine [17], mathematics [18], and chemistry
[19]. Despite the significant advancements in LLMs, several challenges remain. A notable example is hallucinations,
whereby LLMs generate incorrect or fabricated information that can mislead users. Researchers have proposed various
strategies to enhance LLM capabilities and mitigate hallucinations, including practical prompt engineering, identity
setting, lavishpraise, few-shot prompting,and RAG[20, 21,22].
Wei et al. introduced a problem-solving approach called the Chain of Thought (CoT) that significantly enhanced the
problem-solving capabilities of LLMs [23]. Jin et al. further demonstrated that complex tasks benefited more from
extended reasoning sequences [24]. Wang et al. introduced self-consistency with CoT; their approach was proven to
effectively select the best solution following a consistency evaluation of multiple CoT outcomes [25]. Yao et al.
revisited the human logical reasoning process, highlighting that human reasoning and decision-making for complex
problems are not linear. They revisited Newell's early topology of the human problem-solving process [26] and
proposed the Tree of Thoughts (ToT) as a method of searching within the mental space in the form of a tree [27].
Maciej et al. improved data structures by introducing a problem-solving method that is closer to human thinking, i.e.,
the Graph of Thoughts [28]. Ding et al. proposed addressing the limitations of the "Penrose Triangle" by applying the
3concept of Everything of Thought to co-optimise performance, efficiency, and adaptability [29]. This body of work
collectively underscores a significant trend in the evolution of problem-solving methodologies in LLMs, driving them
towards models that more closely mimic human cognitive processes and adapt more robustly to complex real-world
tasks.
2.3 LLM-basedgenerativeconceptualdesign
LLMs have numerous benefits that render them exceedingly effective in various fields. LLM-based designs have
emerged as anovel paradigm that hasgarnereda considerableamount of interest. Withaccess topre-collected design
knowledge [30], LLMs can define designs based on the inputs of problem-specific keywords and leverage previously
learned diverse design styles, creativity, and informationfrom various disciplines and fields to generate potential design
solutions. This approach ensures that LLMs establish a thorough understanding of existing design cases and solutions
while drawing extensively from the fields of engineering, cognitive sciences, and creative arts. Consequently, their
integration into conceptual design has become particularly valuable, enhancing the innovative potential of design
solutions.
Zhu and Luo's innovative exploration of GPTs for verbal design concepts utilised customised datasets to test the
capacity of GPT models for problem- and analogy-driven reasoning. The findings revealed that GPT-2 and GPT-3
could effectively harness learned design styles and cross-domain information to create novel design solutions [3].
Building on this, Ma et al. investigated the ability of LLMs to generate conceptual design solutions by comparing them
with those derived via crowdsourcing methods [4]. They observed that prompt engineering and few-shot learning
significantly enhanced the design outputs, highlighting that LLMs, particularly when optimised with these techniques,
offer substantial support during the conceptual design phase. However, a major challenge in LLM design is their
opacity and limited controllability, which often prevent them from producing design concepts that precisely match
specific problems and requirements. To address this challenge, Wang et al. introduced an innovative methodology that
integrates LLMs with a function–behaviour–structure (FBS) model to facilitate generative conceptual design [5]. The
results demonstrated that the designs generated via this task-decomposition method were more creative and closely
alignedwith the designrequirements.
In conclusion, LLM-based design has considerable potential for innovation. Techniques such as prompt engineering,
the fine-tuning of pre-trained models, and task decomposition are instrumental in advancing LLM-based design
technology, astheyopen newavenuesforresearch and applicationinthe fieldof design innovation.
3 DIAMONDOFTHOUGHT
3.1 ConstructionoftheLLMprocessframeworkforconceptdesigngeneration
Problem-solving within the design-thinking paradigm is inherently complex, dynamic, and iterative. Designers must
flexibly adjust their directions and navigate through numerous divergences and convergences throughout the process.
4Thisnecessitates a departure fromconventional thought patterns, embracing divergent thinking to generatea multitude
of creative ideas and solutions and subsequently integrating selected directions to adapt to constantly changing needs
and conditions. To effectively harness LLMs for conceptual design tasks, it is essential to first define the
characteristics and overall processes of this complex cognitive model and then systematically structure it to fully
exploitthe advantagesof LLMs.
Building on previous design-thinking models, we developed the DoT framework, an enhanced conceptual design
task-focused framework grounded in the thinking tree methodology. This framework was designed to emulate the
fundamental design-thinking characteristics and problem-solving flows of designers. The DoT framework allows LLMs
to deconstruct design tasks and address them sequentially, drawing on design knowledge to fulfil the tasks. The
diamond metaphor represents the creation and filtering of nodes, capturing the essence of design thinking through the
interplay of divergence and convergence to ensure that the iterative process not only generates new ideas, it also
keeps themrelevantand targeted.
As illustrated in Figure 1, our DoT framework is characterised by a multistep process with alternating divergence and
convergence based on a database and user input information framework. Waidelich et al. conducted a comprehensive
analysis of 35 design-thinking models, tallying the frequency of different stages across all models: "Ideation/Ideate"
appeared 30 times, "Prototype/Prototyping" 22 times, "Test/Testing" 20 times, "Define" 17 times, and
"Understanding/Understand" 14 times[31]. Accordingly, we structured the process of using LLMs to solve design tasks
as follows:
Fig.1:DOTframework
51. Discovery: The design process begins by exploring the contextual background of the design task whereby the
LLMengages inbothactive andpassive informationcollection.
2. Requirement Analysis and Definition: This stage identifies and prioritises potential needs from the accumulated
information, filtering themaccording to theirsignificance andthe designers’inclinations.
3. Produce, Ideate, and Define: Leveraging previously acquired information and knowledge, this phase involves
divergent thinking regarding a product's functionalities, followed by a process of comparison, selection, and integration
tofinalisethe product'sdefinition.
4. Technology Analysis and Definition: This phase involves numerous integrations using the given design database
cases and inherent knowledge of LLMs to devise concrete technical strategies, followed by comparison, filtering, and
amalgamationof these strategiestosolidify the ultimate technicalstrategy.
Unlike previous models, we did not allocate divergent or convergent thinking to specific stages. Instead, we maintain
that several stages require a divergence-convergence cycle that serves as a strategy for self-consistency, a method
alreadyvalidated for itsefficacy. Thisapproach isappliedthroughoutthe entire designprocess.
3.2 Applicationofdesigncasedatabases
Human designers often rely on external knowledge and past designs to complete their design tasks. Relevant design
cases offer valuable insight into the background information, current solutions, and potential future pathways for
addressing specific design problems. They serve as a crucial source of inspiration for the innovation and exploration of
newdesign opportunities.These casesalsoprovide established strategiesforsolving designproblems and demonstrate
how previous designs have successfully integrated cross-disciplinary knowledge, such as technical applications,
material selection, and structural principles, to address complex challenges. This allows designers to apply similar
strategies and methods in their current practices. Additionally, these cases inspire designers to explore untapped
opportunities,helpingthemto identifyunmet needs andpotential pain points.
Our previousworkintegrated datafrom prominentdatabases [6], including Webof Science, Scopus,IEEE, DBLP, and
NCBI, as well as information from globally recognised sources, such as Wearable Technologies, Fabric of Digital Life,
YouTube, Apple, SONY, and Fitbit. This effort resulted in the curation of a comprehensive dataset comprising 1,603
wearable device prototypes and 1,129 market products, as shown in Figure 2. The human body serves as the platform
for wearable devices and plays a pivotal role in their development and design. Thus, we adopted an embodied aspect
and developed an encoding method for wearable device data based on the embodied FBS ontology theory. Specifically,
the functionality of wearable devices is dependent on the requirements necessitated by the embodied existence of the
body in the world. The perception-motor coupling system within the body schema facilitates an interactive channel
through which wearable objects can interface with the body, whereas the physical characteristics inherent to the body
provide the foundational space for the distribution of wearable objects. Consequently, the database focuses on the
6specific functions of wearable devices at the functional level, analyses the perception and action modes of the
interaction between the body and wearable devices at the behavioural level, and considers the technical elements, on-
body locations, and modes of wearing at the structural level. This database provides a foundation for the subsequent
production ofwearable designs throughthe integration of multiple perspectives and embodiedcognition.
Fig.2:Wearabledatabasestructure（Xu,Hao,Sun,Qu,Mo,Wang,&Xu,2023）
Previous research has shown that providing appropriate prompts to LLMs can inspire and guide models to generate
higher quality and more innovative design concepts [5]. Consequently, at each design stage, we input different
categories of information from the database into the LLMs in the form of prompts, as illustrated in Figure 3.
Specifically, in the discovery phase, we initially expose the LLM to case data to understand the broad context of the
design task, thereby enhancing the understanding and definitions of the design problems and requirements. Based on
the background information provided, the LLM identifies possible categories of target devices, finds the best products
in the wearable knowledge vector database, and includes these products and related data in the design process as
benchmarks for future design tasks. In the Produce, Ideate, and Define phase, we input information related to the
functional and behavioural aspects of database cases into the LLM to facilitate deeper insight into the existing design
case solution strategies. Additionally, in the subsequent Technology Analysis and Definition stage, we input structural
information into the LLM to ensure that it generates more reasonable technical solutions based on the existing FBS
matchingrelationships.

3.3 NodeDivergenceandConvergence
In thissection, weprovidefurther details onthe node divergence andconvergence strategiesof the DOT framework.
Thought divergence strategy. When a new design stage is reached, the interim results from the previous phase are
analysed and used as a foundation for subsequent design solution development. We aimed to closely simulate the real-
world problem-solving processes of designers and maximally incorporate divergent thinking. During the several rounds
of divergent thinking, we focus on several key points. First, designers' thought processes are continuous, as they
consider design problems holistically, rather than addressing each step in isolation. Additionally, designers do not limit
their problem solving to their own knowledge, instead exploring external information and multidisciplinary insights to
optimisedesign outcomes. Thus, prompts werecarefullycrafted toaccuratelysimulate the designprocess.
The initial information and previous design output are respectively represented by xand y, and the current layer
design output(i.e.,the stateof the tree)is representedby

�� �� …�� �� �� ∨�
We chose a top-down continuous structure for the thinking tree, allowing extensive divergence in each layer to
simulate the divergent phase of design thinking. In conceptual design solutions, frequently recurring solutions may
represent general conventional approaches to solving design problems, often with high feasibility. In contrast, less
frequent solutions can be more creative and inspire innovative approaches to the problem. Within this tree structure,
LLMs often generate numerous repeated nodes under synonymous prompts. Although this repetition may limit the
8cognitive space, it also helps the LLM to assess the importance of different solutions. Thus, meaningful repetition was
retainedduring thedivergence phase.
Thought convergence strategy. In addition to extensive divergence, optimising the design plan requires effective
convergence to reach a phased consensus. Uncertainty in design direction and excessive divergence can significantly
limit the design problem solving efficiency. Some design methodologies view the core of innovative problem solving as
finding optimal solutions among multiple conflicting needs. Therefore, during the node-generation phase, we allow the
LLM to generate repetitive ideas within a limited cognitive space. Subsequently, in the convergence phase, we
comprehensively evaluatethe divergent results toformulate the nextdesign strategy.

In this layer, the thought process should incorporate the nodes generated in the previous step and all of the
information established within the previous layers. However, changes in these nodes are not applied for selection or
comparison,butrather a synthesis basedon existing information. Thus,we introducea design-node synthesiser:
, (5)
+1 +1
�� �� �� ∨� ��
The process of staged convergence in design involves eliminating redundancies or merging ideas. This requires a
comprehensiveunderstanding of the design problem,integratingmultiple perspectives, and balancing potential conflicts
to develop an optimal strategy. During this process, many potential solutions and decisions are not entirely clear. These
are gradually revealed and utilisedthrough progressiveexploration and optimisationprocesses. Therefore,the proposed
node-filtering strategy is based on a comprehensive self-consistency assessment. None of the possible solutions (p) is
fullyexplicit inthe reasoning process.Instead, through promptsand logical planning, the LLM can capturepotential and
optimalsolutionsbyusing contextualcluesand logical relationships.
Prompt strategy. Prompts serve as a fundamental pathway for interaction with LLMs and play a crucial role in the
generation and aggregation of nodes. At specific stages of the tasks, we provide the LLM with prompts of similar
structures to guide their simulation of specific design steps. Additionally, we aimed to enhance the maintainability and
interchangeability of the prompts.
We designed specific design methods m, example prompts e, and frequencies n, employing the function () to call
variousparameter listsacrossdifferentsteps.

3.4 SearchingAlgorithm
According to Cross, design experts typically employ top-down, breadth-first strategies and explicit problem
decomposition techniques [32]. Inspired by these practices, our algorithm adopts breadth-first search (BFS) as the
traversal method for the DOT optimisation, applying a structure similar to that of ToT-BFS algorithms [27]. Specifically,
nodes are generated by applying the aforementioned generation strategy during level-order traversal, pruning is
achieved under the selection strategy, and the prompt generation method enhances the implementation of these
strategies. It is important to note that this algorithm primarily describes the divergent and convergent phases of the
DOT, which only occur in the iterative stages of the design process, i.e., requirement analysis, functional definition, and
technicalsolutiongeneration.

wearable technology [33]. These domains included fitness and wellness, entertainment, healthcare and medical, and
industrial and =military. To ensure fairness in the prompt phrasing, we assigned four wearable design challenges to the
four groups and conducted experiments by using the same task input for each group. Table 1 presents the tasks in

4.3 EvaluationMetrics
Previous reports have extensively discussed the creative evaluation of design concepts, primarily focusing on the
outcomes of these concepts [34,35]. The consensual assessment technique (CAT) is the most widely recognised and
used evaluation metric in this field. It leverages the diverse perspectives and knowledge of experts by utilising group
consensus to enable a generally unbiased evaluation of creativity across various works. Alternatively, Shah et al. refined
the following four dimensions to enable evaluation of the effectiveness and creativity of design concepts: quantity,
novelty, quality,and variety [36,37, 38]. Similarly, Xu etal. provideda setof design evaluation criteriathat includedtwo
dimensions related to design quality, i.e., rationality and integrity. These dimensions facilitate detailed evaluation and
analysis[39].
The novelty metric assesses whether design concepts offer unique solutions or perspectives that are essential for
expanding the design space by exploring solutions that are not initially apparent. The variety metric measures the
breadth of the solution space explored during the ideation process, emphasising the importance of examining multiple
14perspectives and creative restructuring problems. The quality metric focuses on the practicality and feasibility of ideas,
focusing on the extent to which design solutions can meet established needs and factors such as cost and
sustainability are reasonably considered. Furthermore, the total number of generated ideas supports the notion that
generating more ideas increases the likelihood of producing superior solutions. Considering this, we established
objectivemeasuresto evaluate theeffectiveness ofideation, which has beenwidely adopted in previous research.Thus,
our study applied these metrics. However, because we required designers and the GPT to provide a set number of
design concepts for each design problem during the testing process, we opted to evaluate the design plans across
three dimensions: novelty, variety, and quality, as shown in Figure 6. We further divided the quality dimension into
rationalityand completeness subdimensionsto allow a moreprecisecomparison andevaluation of the design concepts.
Fig.6:Evaluationmetrics
4.4Results
After the four groups completed the design tasks, we developed a questionnaire based on the design standards.
Subsequently, we recruited six professional designers with more than five years of experience and a deep
understanding of the concept of embodied cognition to serve as assessment experts. These experts independently
evaluatedthe performance of the fourdesigner typeson the fourdesign tasks.
Table2:Consistencyevaluation
Metrics Kendall’sW
15Rationality 1.00
Integrality 0.90
Novelty 0.91
Variety 0.91
Using the CAT, we initially analysed data consistency. Given the extensive gradation of our rating scale, which
provided evaluators with considerable flexibility, there were notable fluctuations in the numerical values. Consequently,
we did not compute these results directly. Instead, we converted the rating data into a rank-order table and applied
Kendall's law to assess consistency. As shown in Table 2, the final analysis revealed that all metrics reached the
desiredlevels of correlation.
The final results are shown in Figure 7. Comparison of the total scores and individual indicators revealed a clear
score ranking according to the established design scoring standards: IO < CoT < DoT. The difference between the
human designers and DoTs was not significant (p = 0.89). Particularly, according to the experimental results, DoT
enhanced the overall ability of the LLM to perform conceptual design tasks, yielded better effects than CoT, and
closely matchedhuman performance.
Regarding the rationality metric, IO was considered to e the least rational, whereas CoT effectively enhanced the
rationality of design solutions, approaching the level of human designers, as in other tasks. With the support of existing
case data from the wearables database, DoT received the highest score for rationality. In the completeness analysis,
the rankings were as follows: IO < CoT < Human < DoT. DoT provided detailed information on the functionality,
behaviour, and structure at each stage of the design process. Moreover, it was able to obtain specific and rational
technical solutions through queries inthe design database, whichthe other three methods could not achieve.Thus, DoT
is better in terms of completeness. Regarding innovation, IO and CoT scored similarly, and their box plot structures
revealed similar distributions of data. Although DoT ranked above them, the level of innovation from human designers
surpassed that of DoT. Diversity dimension mainly focuses on the designers' ability to explore the design space during
the divergentphase, withthe data indicatingthe followingorder:IO <CoT <DoT< Human.
16Fig.7:Evaluationresults
We further compared the DoT and Human groups, finding that DoT significantly outperformed humans in terms of
rationality and completeness, but was less effective in terms of innovation and diversity; these differences were
statistically significant (p = 0.025, 0.039, 0.017 < 0.05, and p = 0.350 > 0.05, respectively). Notably, regarding diversity,
although the statistical analysis did not reveal a significant difference between the DoT and humans (p = 0.350 > 0.05)
at the selected level of significance, the observed difference between the two groups was relatively small. These subtle
differences may be relevant for further research and analysis. Moreover, the small sample size may have limited the
17statistical power of the analysis. Thus, increasing the sample size could boost the statistical power, potentially leading
tomoreconclusive results.
We also conducted additional enquiries for each design task, similar to the Turing test, wherein we asked the
interviewed designers to assess whether the design solutions were conceived by human designers. The probabilities
wereobtainedas presented inTable 3.
Table3:ProbabilityEvaluation
IO CoT DoT Human
50% 41.6% 62.5% 70.8%
During the additional interviews, we made an enquiry regarding the basis of each judge's decision. The judges
mentioned that the responses from the IO group were the easiest to critique because of their tendency to merely
expand on and associate ideas based on a given design problem. Although the IO group provided extensive textual
descriptions, their overall expressions were considered to be empty and lacking practical significance without deep
analysis or concrete solutions. One judge commented that "[t]here is a lot written in the design proposal, but it lacked
any new output, merely reiterating the design requirements." In contrast, responses for the CoT group indicated higher
levels of consistency and coherence. The technical, functional, and material solutions mostly resulted in good
correlations, confirming good structure and logicality. However, the responses were still insufficient. A judge noted that
"[t]he technical and functional solutions in this response were closely linked and focused on four points, but the actual
content seemed to be manufactured to meet a standard structure rather than being substantively rich." Alternatively,
determining whether the design solutions were produced by DoT or humans proved difficult for many judges, as both
groups were considered to have more effectively addressed design challenges and provided viable solutions.
Particularly, the DoT group employed a mature problem-solving process for design challenges and performed detailed
analyses of the design requirements. These characteristics led some judges to misjudge them, thinking that these
responses may have been from experienced human designers: "This solution seems like it may have been written by a
human because it uses an existing framework of thought or sequence of thought, although somewhat mechanised. It
resembles human thinking and expression habits, such as using analogies with features of existing products when
describingspecific functionalpoints andconducting requirement analyses topinpoint the targetuser group."
During the interviews, we invited judges to individually assess whether each design solution incorporated the
concept of embodied cognition. The judges generally believed that the solutions provided by the IO and CoT groups
only considered embodied cognition in terms of multimodal feedback and cognitive load management, interpreting
embodiment primarily by using the body's multimodal information processing channels and designing more intuitive and
user-friendly interfaces. In contrast, the DoT group demonstrated a better understanding of the embodied concepts.
Their design solutions appropriately integrated and applied the body's sensory systems to specific situations and
designed more embodied interaction methods that aligned device operations with natural human behaviour and
18perception. This may be attributed to our database providing the DoT with extensive knowledge regarding how the
functionality and structure of wearable products can optimise and affect human bodily perception and behavioural
responses. For example, one DoT proposal mentioned the following: "By analysing user behavioural patterns and
environmental interactions, the [artificial intelligence] butler can predict user needs and respond in advance, combining
voice output and tactile feedback (such as vibration) to provide necessary guidance and feedback when it is
inconvenienttolook atthe screen." Human designers'understanding of embodied cognitionisdeeper; forinstance, one
human designer mentioned utilising and transforming the embodied experience of experts in the field of engineering
machinery: "Experts accumulate a significant amount of embodied experience during the regular operation of
engineering machinery, which is valuable. Therefore, capturing the typical operational behaviours of experts can be
transformed into intelligent guidance and support tips for smart gloves, thereby enhancing the accuracy of user
operations."
5discussion
We have developed and evaluated a DoT framework. Through comparative experiments, we demonstrated that the
DoTframework effectivelyimprovedthe performance of LLMs onconceptual design tasks.
Previous studies have highlighted the potential of LLMs on generative conceptual design tasks [3, 4, 5]. Ma et al.
demonstrated that, on average, LLMs generatemore feasible and useful designs than crowdsourced solutions, although
the latter tend to offer more novelty [4]. This finding aligns with our results, which indicate that LLMs excel in
integrating and applying diverse knowledge, which allows them to synthesise a wide array of information. This
capability also allows LLMs to consider the technical, material, and functional aspects of design solutions from various
interdisciplinary perspectives, thereby maximising their feasibility and practicality. Ma et al. also explored prompt
engineering by using zero-shot and few-shot learning methods to enhance the quality of LLM responses,
demonstrating that LLMs are highly influenced by the prompts they receive [4]. Implementing an effective prompt
strategy significantly enhances the performance of LLM-generated design solutions. In our study, we carefully
managed prompts by applying structured prompts at specific stages to guide the LLMs to complete the predefined
design steps. Additionally, we integrated the database information into prompts, allowing LLMs to leverage existing
case knowledge. However, we observed that LLMs tend to rely on pre-existing data and common patterns of thinking,
which can limit their ability to generate truly novel ideas or "think outside the box.” Therefore, establishing an
appropriate strategy to co-optimise the problem-solving innovation capabilities of LLMs and rationality of conceptual
design solutions remains an unresolved challenge. Yao et al. proposed the ToT method, which allows LLMs to use
topological structures to simulate human problem-solving processes [24]. Similarly, DoT adopts a tree-like structure
similar to ToT, but it is extended in our study by integrating predefined design steps and support from a design
database, which contribute to enhance its ability to solve design problems. Wang etal. [5] introduced a methodology to
address the challenges of transparency and controllability in LLMs by structuring the design process into decomposed
tasks focused on functional, behavioural, and structural reasoning. They noted that current LLM-based generative
design approaches primarily rely on direct generation, with no theoretical guidance or comprehensive understanding of
19the design requirements. This insight has inspired further research to leverage existing design theories and models to
enhance LLM capabilities. Building on the incorporation of embodied cognition, we encoded the content of the
wearable database according to the basic structure of the FBS model and input it into the LLM in stages. This
approach allows the LLM to be supported by the foundational mapping relationships of the FBS system when analysing
and generating specific design solutions. Additionally, designthinking, an essential theoreticaland model foundationfor
problem solving in the design field, has not been adequately utilised. Therefore, we introduced the DoT framework by
integrating design-thinking models and LLM task-processing capabilities. This framework addresses the existing gap
and offers a potential systematic approach to using LLMs to solve design problems. In addition to applying predefined
design tasks based on design-thinking models, we structured the application of divergent and convergent thinking in
the LLM’s design solution generation process, allowing for more effective and systematic creation and selection of
innovative design concepts. To further enhance LLM controllability during the solution generation process, Wang et al.
fine-tuned the model by using a precollected design knowledge dataset [5], allowing it to effectively utilise domain-
specific knowledge for more relevant and innovative solutions. Similarly, we have incorporated extensive case studies
into the design process through the use of enhanced RAG technology, broadening the knowledge and design themes
accessibleto LLMs.
Overall, the results of this study show that the DoT group scored slightly higher than the human designer group in
terms of completeness and rationality. Based on interviews with scoring experts, we concluded that LLMs have a
notable advantage over human designers in terms of ability to process and analyse large volumes of text data and
integrate interdisciplinary knowledge, which has been widely recognised. In wearable design, the flexible application of
interdisciplinary knowledge is crucial because it provides comprehensive support for solving design problems in various
dimensions. In contrast, human designers with a single background may lack the specialised knowledge required to
cover the entire design process. In this study, LLMs enhanced with existing knowledge and rules from a wearable
design database were found to more effectively align FBS relationships, reduce the frequency of biases and
fabrications, and demonstrate relatively superior performance in terms of rationality and completeness of solutions.
Additionally, through iterative cycles of divergent and convergent thinking, LLMs can explore more design possibilities
andquickly gather, filter,and matchsuitable information.
Nonetheless, the integration of the DoT framework into LLMs has some limitations. Regarding innovation, the DoT
group scored lower than human designers. Although LLMs trained on wearable design case data can gain a solid
understanding of existing cases and rules, this learning process also constrains their ability to innovate in problem
solving. Creative thinking and imagination are crucial for design innovation; human designers can think abstractly and
innovate when faced with the same design problems and case data, break existing frameworks, and generate entirely
new ideas and concepts. This capacity for abstract thinking and innovation makes it challenging for LLMs to emulate
them. Additionally, human designers possess the unique ability to empathise with and understand others' emotions and
needs, often based on personal experiences and a deep understanding of the target user group. This emotional
consideration cannot by replicated by current LLMs. Design is a flexible and complex iterative process that involves not
only the application of explicit knowledge, but also the flexible utilisation of a designer's tacit knowledge and skills.
20Designers often rely on their experience and intuition to make judgments based on deep insights and understanding
accumulated through past design practices and social interactions. However, the informal and individualised nature of
tacit knowledge makes it difficult for LLMs to fully convert it into symbolic knowledge for learning and understanding.
Thus,a designer’s tacitknowledgeand skills are challengingforLLMsto acquireand replicate.
6CONCLUSIONS
Here, we introduced and evaluated the DoT framework, a novel approach designed to enhance LLM capability in the
interdisciplinary field of wearable design. Using a comparative experimental setup, we compared the performances of
human designers and LLMs, which were enhanced through various techniques across several wearable design tasks.
The findingsclearly indicatethe superior design problemsolvingcapability of the DoT framework,demonstrating a level
of comprehension that significantly surpasses those of conventional methods, such as direct IO and CoT frameworks.
However, significant gaps remain in their ability to rival human designers in key areas such as innovation, abstract
reasoning, andempathy.
Future research on applying LLMs to solve design problems should focus on enhancing their autonomy and flexibility
by equipping them with a broader set of design methods, deeper design knowledge, and enhanced behavioural
capabilities. Moreover, future studies should explore the collaborative dynamics between human designers and LLM
agents,catalysingnew formsof design andfostering a dynamic,innovative design environment.
