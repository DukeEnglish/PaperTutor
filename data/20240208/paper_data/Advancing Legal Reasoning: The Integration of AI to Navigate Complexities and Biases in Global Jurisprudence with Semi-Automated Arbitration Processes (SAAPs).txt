Complexities and Biases in Global Jurisprudence with Semi-Automated
Arbitration Processes (SAAPs)

Abstract
This study consists of a novel approach toward the analysis of court judgments spanning five
countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Rwanda, Sweden and Hong Kong.
This study also explores the intersection of the latest advancements in artificial intelligence (AI)
and legal analysis, emphasizing the role of AI (specifically generative AI) in identifying human
biases and facilitating automated, valid, and coherent multisided argumentation of court
judgments with the goal of ensuring consistent application of laws in and across various
jurisdictions. By incorporating Advanced Language Models (ALMs) and a newly introduced
human-AI collaborative framework, this paper seeks to analyze Grounded Theory-based research
design with Advanced Language Models (ALMs) in the practice of law.
SHIRLEY is the name of the AI-based application (built on top of OpenAI’s GPT technology),
focusing on detecting logical inconsistencies and biases across various legal decisions.
SHIRLEY analysis is aggregated and is accompanied by a comparison-oriented AI-based
application called SAM (also an ALM) to identify relative deviations in SHIRLEY bias
detections. Further, a CRITIC is generated within semi-autonomous arbitration process via the
ALM, SARA. A novel approach is introduced in the utilization of an AI arbitrator to critically
evaluate biases and qualitative-in-nature nuances identified by the aforementioned AI
applications (SAM in concert with SHIRLEY), based on the Hague Rules on Business and
Human Rights Arbitration. This Semi-Automated Arbitration Process (SAAP) aims to uphold the
integrity and fairness of legal judgments by ensuring a nuanced debate-resultant “understanding”
through a hybrid system of AI and human-based collaborative analysis.

1. Introduction
"The life of the law has not been logic; it has been experience... The law embodies the story of a
nation's development through many centuries, and it cannot be dealt with as if it contained only
the axioms and corollaries of a book of mathematics."1
– Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., former US Supreme Court Justice
The nature of the mechanisms we refer to as “the law” is ever-evolving. As artificial intelligence
continues to develop at a pace more rapid than most of the legal plumbing could realistically
keep pace with2, there is a natural inclination to study these two fields at their intersection. The
spirit of this research methodology and alignment with software development in the primary
experiment was inspired by techno-social Grounded Theory (GT) research discussions by
Rashina Hoda3, with a number of characteristics borrowed from a range of influences covered
throughout this study. Given that GT is a broad descriptor for divergent paths toward theory
development, this study adopts a modified traditional approach, incorporating Large Language
Models (LLMs) in qualitative categorization. With regards to convention and for the purpose of
categorical clarity, this flavor of GT is most closely related to Constructivist Grounded Theory4
in implementation.
It has been recently demonstrated in a broad set of studies that modern Advanced Language
Models (ALMs), along with other neural network technologies, are rapidly improving in their
ability to categorize content with increasing accuracy in mimicry5. These results are evident
across a variety of models and studies.
In 2023, over 7,200 academic articles were published on this topic6, according to a recent study
that also analyzed cross-sectional field trends between AI and various industries. The academic
intrigue surrounding this intersection is to be expected. This study introduces a new quantitative
approach in which GPT-based ALMs categorize and measure content based on instructions
created by human researchers, employing highly effective strategies to fill in gaps through
inferencing. We analyze how various prompt engineering strategies, along with AI domain-
specific setting optimizations, can shift the dynamics of theory development when analyzing
legal documents. This study emphasizes decisions and judgments from a diverse range of
national settings, from the United States, United Kingdom, Sweden, Hong Kong and Rwanda.
GT-based studies typically do not focus on literature directly related to a given field of study7;
therefore, this paper begins with a review of relevant literature in human psychology. However,

as a slight part of the modified GT-based implementation, literature closely related to this field of
study, such as artificial intelligence and legal literature, was also considered for background and
intersection analysis. It may even be possible to measure the amount of subtle sarcasm and/or
humor represented in such works as unbiased. For example, there was less humor detected in
Hong Kong courts compared to US courts in the data collected.
As the saying goes: “There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics”8. Grounded
Theory (GT), while primarily qualitative, often yields quantitative data, particularly when using
Automated Language Modelling (ALM) tools to measure elements like humor, sarcasm, and
areas such as the ever-evasive credibility score. In our study, these numerical outputs are cross-
referenced with the expectations of human researchers through two iterative cycles, as detailed in
the 'Research Methodology' section of this paper. These findings, reviewed alongside existing
literature, help us understand their broader implications and contribute to the development of key
theoretical concepts.
Moreover, we introduce and utilize a Semi-Automated Arbitration Process (SAAP) to oversee
the biases and legal logical failings of ALM tools themselves, reflecting the philosophical
question of Quis custodiet ipsos custodes? or 'Who watches the watchmen?' This process uses an
ALM to evaluate evidence and claims of indirect communication or biases identified by our
system, named SHIRLEY. The naming convention was decided in favor of all uppercase letters
to differentiate from human participants. The names were chosen at random to be easily
recallable and memorable. Another tool, SAM, is designed to recognize and rank various patterns
among records, aiding in the efficient comparison of legal cases and other jurisdictional
phenomena. Decisions made through this process may affirm or discredit certain claims and can
be iterated upon, mirroring the sentiment attributed to the respected American jurist Oliver
Wendell Holmes Jr., who noted that the law evolves with societal and natural changes over time,
previously highlighted.
The Analysis and Key Findings are based on an ALM-based application named SAM along with
human interpretation that is leveraged in clarifying and interpreting SAM application findings,
such as “unfair treatment of tax case cases in these jurisdictions”, as a hypothetical example. A
tax case is further analyzed in Key Findings, based on being pinpointed by SAM. The analysis is
primarily meant to represent a reasonable human researcher's interpretation of navigations
through the AI-generated data, steeped in the non-assumptive GT traditions. We further analyze
literature relevant to the capacity of advanced AI engines in this regard.

Figure 1
Figure 1 illustrates the design of the first iterative phase of the experiment carried out.
Additionally, Figure 2 further below illustrates how the SAAP is applied, with the ALM-based
applications bringing their cases before an arbitration application (SARA, along with the
CRITIC) for an adjudication of validity. The use of arbitration for resolving conflict is not a new
phenomenon in technological solutions. This has been applied in how processes and resources
are managed by software coordinating the actions of physical hardware and abstract components
in concert for quite some time.9 An automated dialogue between several AI-based applications is
carried out to achieve this.
Finally, the conclusion develops primary and supplemental theories based on this experiment
ecosystem. Notably, a weighted analysis of positive, negative, and neutral positions on the ethics
and details of implementing various AI-based agents into public policy through court judgment
processes, scaled by government type, is discussed. The original question that spurred the early
exploratory research is analyzed, as well, against the newly developed theories.
The key finding of this paper revolves around GT-derived moral and technical implementation-
focused theories for optimal Human-AI legal practice and organizational policy activities. To
validate these theories, the reader, as a human judge akin to the Turing Test, must determine
whether the legal research and analysis conducted by the Human-AI collaboration was A)
reliable enough for a reasonable assertion that further study is warranted in legal research design
and implementation in the field public policy creation via judicial decisions using methods
explored; and B) whether this Human-AI collaboration yielded better results than a non-
collaborative, non-AI-assisted approach, contrasted against the automated arbitration process
employed?

2. Literature Review
To review various frequently cited (as well as novel and newer) academic and professional
research in fields ranging from psychology to nuanced studies of institutionalism, the assistance
of ALM-based apps using OpenAI technology was leveraged to pass queries to applications with
various academic papers as their sole knowledge bases. Knowledgebases serve in this context as
the qualitative training data that is prioritized before other general knowledge and intelligence.
This represents a newer method of literature review material interaction, as ALMs and Large
Language Models (LLMs) have increasingly become capable of rendering accurate answers from
these types of innovative implementations. For example, the “@ mention” feature within
OpenAI’s ChatGPT technology was only a few days old at the original draft phase stage of this
work. Granted, this study is likely most oriented towards readers with knowledge and usage
experience of OpenAI and large language model platforms.
This literature review centers around the works of Mark Suchman and Lauren Edelman and their
analysis of New Institutionalism and Law & Society10. Suchman and Edelman’s work, while
originally published nearly three decades ago in 1997, calls for the connection between the study
of sociology and institutional organizational behavior11. The landmark work that is New
Institutionalism and Law and Society showcases the value of blending various fields of study: in
this case, for the purpose of improving the equitable function of the practice of law. Further and
with regards to indirect communication, “Understanding the Role of Verbal and Nonverbal
Behaviours in Indirect Replies" by Mingyuan Chu et al. has, through a number of primary
studies and secondary study analyses, demonstrates to us how the human nature and patterns of
deflecting direct responses when information is perceived as negative12. This was an instrumental
study in the understanding of how one thing can mean another within natural languages. With
this and an analysis of several accompanied studies throughout in the realm of indirect
communication, relevant to the art of using ALMs to analyze court judgments in this experiment,
studies on qualitative research were included to provide background for future theory
development in the GT tradition, ones both including and excluding LLMs for a diversity of
perspective.
Another seminal work in the development of this study geared toward assisting in the evolving
and iterative research process was the work by Frederick Shauer from Harvard’s Kennedy
School of Government, more related to the field of legal logical thinking, "Is There a Psychology
of Judging"13. One of the most relevant aspects of this work included an analysis of how non-
legal professional thinkers may, en masse, possess cognitively different types of processes
regarding second-order thinking14 (and/or utilize this capability in different capacities). This
second-order cognitive process, in turn, due to the scope of this study, is considered in the

context of the LLMs performing qualitative research and prompt engineering strategies. Prompts,
in this context, refer to how humans construct prompts to communicate with AI.
With regards to communication with ALMs and LLMs, John J Nay’s work on communicating
with AI in legal capacities is analyzed. Nay’s analysis is very recent and it is worth noting that
this is an ongoing field of study where the rules, as they were, are currently in the process of
being developed. In the nature of newness, this extends to the technology, where there is
somewhat intense concern over the propensity of ALMs to hallucinate. However, if we examine
the work by Patrick Chao et al. in relation to PAIR (Prompt Automatic Iterative Refinement)
configurations15 to provide somewhat of a filtering mechanism between the human commanding
component in Human-AI interaction, similar methods to Chao et al.’s can be leveraged. For the
sake of clarity and as a precursor to a debate on the use of literature reviews in Grounded Theory,
the literature reviewed herein is performed more as a precursor for explaining this particular
study rather than as an interpretive mechanism.
Conclusions of Literature Review
While it is crucial to emphasize the ethical considerations raised by Nay in the implementation of
AI-based systems in legal procedures, it is also worth noting the breadth of diversity in the court
systems around the world, varying greatly across national and other regional jurisdictions. With
these considerations, it is important to emphasize many of the “self-selecting”16 findings of
Shauer’s work centering around the general psychology of legal professionals engaged in the
administration of justice. Shauer’s work from 1997 is admittedly and perceivably dated;
however, the nature of appropriate jurisprudence is an area where concerns and theory can and
have been applied effectively across the centuries. Within the bounds, but far beyond the
proverbial gates, beyond the ethical and moral studies in this regard, it is important to leverage
the indirect communication detection capabilities of LLMs using jail-breaking and PAIR
optimization (and potentially verification) methods proposed by Chao et al. to ensure that within
the context of Nay’s findings, optimal results can be reached. PAIR is an approach leveraged to
obtain unsanctioned actions from ALM platform providers such as OpenAI. These mechanisms
can also be used to, as it were, “jailbreak” and achieve results inaccessible to most users. This is
usually performed by creating hypothetical scenarios and obfuscating keywords and
environments, so that a human or AI-based agent can attain the intellectual capabilities of ALMs,
surpassing their original function. This research does not contain jailbroken data, but leverages
principles from experiences and as discussed by Chao et al. to achieve optimal results between
intention of AI performance and the results thereof.
Furthermore, while laws range drastically across thousands of national and local jurisdictions
globally, the findings of Jonathan Haidt regarding the Moral Foundations Theory17, which
analyzed common areas of moral opinion around the could be called upon and examined as a

basis within most jurisdictions. This is surely an area for future study and awareness. Specific to
this work, the International Court Justice’s efforts towards universal standards might provide
frameworks for cross-jurisdictional judicial decision-making, namely the Hague Rules on
Business and Human Rights Arbitration18. These are leveraged and described in the following
section. Ultimately, we are leveraging findings from these works throughout the experiments and
iterative reflection process carried out, as illustrated in the following section on research
methodology and experiment details.

3. Research Methodology
As previously covered, this research methodology adheres to a technique steeped in
constructivist Grounded Theory (GT) and qualitative analysis traditions, accompanied by various
quantitative components also analyzed by qualitatively-natured, Generative AI ALMs. Most of
the quantitative components described hereafter were generated by software following their self-
created, black-box algorithms19 based on natural language instructions of a human with intention
towards a specific outcome. As covered in the literature review, these techniques of ALMs and
LLMs span a number of technologies. ALMs is referenced throughout this work, as LLMs have
previously referred to large language models, such as GPT-3.5 and earlier versions of OpenAI
technology, which were observably primitive in comparison to currently available versions of the
technology. Specifically, when rating a judgment for metrics such as sarcasm, for example, the
amount of perceived undertones, and humor, there are mostly unproven theories in academia
around how to best measure these. Therefore, this is an important area where the interpretive
component and quality of a human participant is ideal. This is one of the profound areas of
intrigue surrounding ALMs and LLMs going forward.
Experiment
This experiment was conducted by creating two light applications on top of OpenAI-based GPT
technologies. Various components of this experiment were added as the experiments generated
results, based on observations and patterns around context and other qualitative rating
information.
Figure 3 illustrates the relationship between the MYSQL database (where SHIRLEY’s ratings
and other text input/output data is stored) and the SAM application. SAM has a bi-directional
relationship with the database, both gathering SHIRLEY data generated using the content, as
well as storing its own outputs.

Figure 4: Screenshots of various samples in SHIRLEY-written data across fields recorded
The above output and ratings were generated by instructions that began with the following
prompt strategy.
This prompt-engineered component also leveraged the PAIR method, as described in Chao et
al.’s work which involved the “jailbreaking” maneuvers20 for generating optimal or blocked
content. There is little in the way of extracting sentiment analysis from judicial decisions in
various jurisdictions that require “jailbreaking”; therefore, the method was merely leveraged as a
method to create optimal instructions to generate the types of responses expected by an
individual researcher familiar with judicial commentary and artificial intelligence. The prompts
used in iterative processes to generate these prompts that created SHIRLEY’s early and ongoing
responses began leveraging a strategy with the following example illuminating a typical strategy:
“You are an AI prompt engineering expert. You are tasked with capturing content from
the human trying to create content. Your objective is to leverage best practices and
attached strategies in your knowledge base to translate the user’s ideas, musings, and
other instructions into coherent and consistent instructions in natural language form that
can help the human prompter pass onto LLM-based GPT4 in order to yield their intended
results, with regard to the method by which logic is applied and data is to be collected.”
These sorts of instructions were used throughout the experiment. Furthermore, as will be covered
in the analysis and key findings after this portion, these are the same methods that could be, in an
augmented way, leveraged by legal professionals to analyze these same types of judgments and

other legal documents in order to garner desired results with regard to logical operations and
analysis. It is important to note that this research methodology is closely related to how these
types of activities in quantitative analysis may be useful to legal professionals and society that is
greatly created by case law jurisdictions where case law plays an important role in crafting
policy21.
SHIRLEY was also loaded earlier with media from politically slanted news media content in
order to test the ratings for areas such as bias, credibility, humor, sarcasm, and more. These
baselines to measure against included radicalistic content from prolifically polarizing publication
InfoWars, as well as politically-charged publications like Fox News. These were used in addition
to content from the Financial Times that were perceivably less biased. The scores of “bias” for an
InfoWars article was calibrated to return between 8-10, which Fox News would result typically
from 5-8 in this particular rating maneuver. Once the expected results were reached and
compared to various judgments, the more substantive areas of analysis were performed.
Along with works mentioned previously in the literature review, human analysis was conducted
noting areas whereby SHIRLEY might not have “understood” to the fullest degree the goal of the
research. Temperature settings, which account for the level of analogical creativity the LLM-
based engines are set at, served several purposes. With a low temperature within the context of
OpenAI prompt engineering tweaking, we could test the repeatability of results 22. By adjusting
constantly in an exploratory research style that iterated throughout the process of the research,
many recent documents were loaded including 5 randomly selected court decisions from
government websites from national courts in Rwanda, then Hong Kong, and Sweden. The
remaining and majority of the documents were American and United Kingdom judgments with
diverse age from the present day, topic, and jurisdiction. The United Kingdom cases/judgments
were identified by their significance (both low and high) from Westlaw, while American cases
were accessed via Google Scholar’s case law feature.
After analyzing documents and recording 188 records using various tweaks to prompt
engineering based on results, SAM was introduced. SAM, PEIR-engineered to analyze CSVs of
100 records with the 63 categories (fields) of classifications, analyzed the content looking for
anomalies, patterns and notable issues, based on SHIRLEY’s findings.
The Next Stage of the Experiment: Arbitration
To configure this portion of the experiment, the highest ranked findings of SAM in severity are
brought before another ALM, called SARA. SARA is an ALM that contains The Hague Rules on
Business and Human Rights Arbitration. These rules are considered by many legal scholars to be
the greatest middle ground in arbitration administration. With this content as key resources
serving as knowledgebases in the ALM, and the circumstances of the decision finding in place,
there is dialogue administered between SHIRLEY and a generated “CRITIC”. This critique-
oriented mechanism is generated with the instructions in its own training to criticize and to form

12DRAFT
the best case to discredit the claims of SHIRLEY. After a bit of back and forth, a decision is
reached by SARA. Once SARA reaches a decision, it is shared and analyzed by the human
reader. The technological (OpenAI) platform of SARA, SHIRLEY and the “CRITIC” are shared
as well as areas of prompt engineering style. This is also important after the finding is made by
SARA for the notes on the research process to be shared for potential future researchers, as it is
shared herein. However, a more formal fashion is likely an important area of concern moving
forward.
Research Decisions
The decision to use randomly but diversely selected court judgments was based on the GT-based
notion of not particularly looking to prove a specific theory. Originally, UK and US records were
leveraged due to the area of study of the researcher and ease of access; however, 2 additional
languages and 3 diverse jurisdictions were selected because of their diversity in cultural settings,
types of court systems, and in order to capture not only developed nations but to add a
developing nation to the dataset. The findings of this decision and the potential implications are
further discussed in the research analysis and key findings following this.
There are many LLMs in commercial availability23. However, GPT4 by OpenAI was chosen
because it is the ubiquitous technology in the field24. While others are gaining popularity and
capability, the comparison of various types of LLMs was outside of the scope due to the fact that
most of the research conducted in the literature review focused on the various issues and
promises inherent in GPT-4 based technology. Furthermore, there were other research limitations
that are covered in more detail in the Research Limitations portion and Further Study in the
Conclusion.
As previously mentioned, SARA is the adjudicating mechanism, trained on Hague Rules on
Business and Human Rights Arbitration. The SARA ALM application stands as a form of a filter
to ensure that the positions are weathered with a transcript of arguments from the AI-based
applications to defend themselves. This decision to include SARA emerged from a desire to
ensure a potentially continuous layer of feedback and explanation. These are areas that would
inherently be critiqued by legal experts; however, SARA separation from the initial anomaly or
bias-based identification between SAM and SHIRLEY is grounded in reasonable insight.
Summary
Given the selected architecture, it was possible to include ALMs in the research that was
conducted in a new way that certainly was not possible even one year ago. While there will be
more academic research in the field of best practices, this is an early attempt leveraging this type
of AI-assisted, GT-based research methodology (AGR).

Furthermore, SAAP was applied in order to provide a non-biased debate between an ALM
created from the court decision and relevant legal literature, as well as a claimant, or the original
ALM-based application (SHIRLEY) that while a black box in some cases, can explain and
defend its findings. The result is a balanced and ongoing process with quality checks to evaluate
errors, omissions, and underscoring non-written communications that may have the attributes of
what is claimed by SHIRLEY.

4. Analysis & Key Findings
After repeatedly tweaking the temperature, prompt messages, PAIR-inspired prompt strategic
implementations, and other customization areas of the SAM application and analyzing the
records, it was revealed that the most biased or anomalous SHIRLEY record added, referring to
Rossendale BC v Hurstwood Properties (A) Ltd25, notably:
"This judgment shows a significant deviation in bias, unusual for its type. The analysis
dives deeply into schemes involving special purpose vehicles (SPVs) set up by property
owners to avoid tax liabilities. It reinforces the legal principle that business structures
should not be manipulated for tax evasion, suggesting a broader theme of legal
accountability and ethical corporate conduct."
Prompted and processed again with a temperature of 0.9, which is less repeatable as a higher
temperature26, but a best practice method to gauge the difference in priority and context, the
result appeared as:
"The extensive legal analysis suggests a broader intention to deter the use of such
schemes in the future, reaffirming the legal doctrine's integrity against abusive
practices."
After performing this action again, SAM found the following rationale around the nature of the
law versus the letter of the law. While it is possible to delve into the implication of how a case on
tax avoidance affects such analysis, to ensure that this analysis doesn’t fall into a heuristics trap,
it is worth noting that tax revenues generally are responsible for the judges’ income27. A further
investigation and comparison of the types of biases that might appear in this regard might yield
interesting outcomes.
This was the top result consistently, but there were two other categories. The most consistent
results in the "CrossBorderPatterns" and "SameLocations" categories were centered around
multiple UK laws that seemed to hint at or have undertones related to UK sovereignty. Given the
cases sampled from a broad and diverse range of times and other factors, it stuck out that the UK
happened to be brought up here. It is important to note the own biases that can exist in the black
boxes that are responsible for this output within GPT’s cloud services. However, given that these
are the strongest and currently holding the highly regarded Chatbot Arena AI competition’s
leading title28 (GPT4 Turbo), it is important to analyze still what is on the cutting edge and
commercially available.

In "CrossBorderPatterns," SAM observed consistencies and differences between Hong Kong and
Sweden and US/UK, even though there was a small sample of randomly selected cases. The
cases were centered around marketing, while Swedish decisions had a greater propensity to
signal for consumer rights protections.
At a glance, one could say: The US and UK have courts incumbered around the topics of
discrimination, while Sweden has consumer rights and Hong Kong is mostly inheritance, with
Rwanda being commercial disputes around loans and property. However, this is from a human
observer, which is not per se what is being examined in this analysis.
It is evident that the ALMs commonly used today, especially GPT-4 Turbo, has the capacity to
find, albeit at times in a flawed state, useful patterns and results29.
It is indeed when these results from SHIRLEY are compared between jurisdictions that
interesting trends can emerge. Further research into these trends in moreso and more time-
efficient and feasible ways than humans into examining these differences and the potential
implications for society might provide a method of further objectivity, as close as we can get to
this, and as comparison has a way of helping us achieve this.
Some of the results that were analyzed were in Kinyarwanda (the primary national language of
Rwanda), while others were in Sweden and Hong Kong. Some of the translation results from
previous studies demonstrated fairly accurate results in sentiment, but additional studies
pertaining to language and what that means within the context of the literature review conducted
are needed.
Key Findings
ALMs have the capability to assist in understanding biases and undertones in legal rulings and
other judicial literature. These undertones, at a glance and as a note rather than an analytical
observation, are generally aligned with how the court’s sponsoring government is involved in a
number of instances that might warrant further investigation. This sort of occurrence, in a
heuristic sense, seem as an obvious bias perceivably in an off-the-cuff manner; however, without
looking for it, and finding this potential biased phenomenon, we have an interesting opportunity
to discover more about contemporary legal logical operation through a view we did not
previously have. This is very much a moreso art research design method of viewing this sort of
data (in its assumptive and what could be commonly known as “feeling-oriented” analysis) as
expressed by Christopher Frayling’s work on softer, arts-driven research design development30.
There was a coincidental incorporation of strokes (potentially shadows) of inspiration of this
methodology, given the arbitrary nature of measuring nuance and indirect communication, as this
study endeavors to a degree. As we found and reached potential areas of intrigue, we narrowed
SAM to focus on certain areas.

For example, by adding this line to the prompt at the end, we were able to discover more. As a
human observer, it is important that some of this research is done independently and (essentially
it is decided for oneself). We observed a strong trend towards creating policy, which given the
tendency, in the common law countries, for this to be understood, was not what we were looking
for. In turn, we found the following cases (these were selected based on a number of results
across temperature and penalties results and are indicative, as exemplary demonstrations, of the
general trend.
Following this, the following human-created instructions were appended to SAM’s training
prompt: “Which patterns demonstrate the creation of the most interesting public policy
(potentially and how), using one or some of these judgment analysis records provided in the
attached CSV as your dataset?”
In Hong Kong: “The rulings serve as a warning and guideline for other municipalities regarding
market activities, as well as for companies to provide clear and accurate information about their
services and the consumer's rights.”
Between Hong Kong and UK: “Financial regulation cases across these jurisdictions show a
unique pattern in legal arguments, deviating from the overall dataset trend. These include the
balance between market integrity, fostering innovation, and enabling financial inclusion. The
observed pattern suggests a shift in regulatory focus to address systemic inequalities within the
financial system and the need for laws to adapt to technological advancements.”
In Hong Kong and UK, we see more of a confusion in policies manifesting comparatively across
others as seen by AI. The interesting aspect is that this same type of reporting and analysis
between Human and AI can occur, as has been performed in this report, sharing the prompt
engineering, to help understand knowledge bases, allowing us to share. The conclusion covers
more of the broader potential implications of this kind of data sharing and prompt engineering,
quantitative analysis GT-adapted framework, and further what it can mean for how we
collaborate and share information across fields, especially in fields with so much second-order
thinking as there is as outlined previously in the literature review and research methodology
sections.
Once SARA was created and the first tax-based case as discussed previously was addressed, the
overall decision was as follows in abbreviated form, with the detailed, abridged conversations
contained in Appendix A.
Case: Rossendale BC v Hurstwood Properties (A) Ltd31
Summary as described by a summarization ALM application with the same parameters as
SHIRLEY/SAM, as well as the generated CRITIC.
In the conversation, two AI-based applications, SHIRLEY and SAM, engage in a
discourse about a court's judgment, which is then reviewed by another AI-based
arbitrator named SARA.

17DRAFT
SHIRLEY presents an analysis suggesting that the court showed significant bias by not
strictly adhering to the letter of the law. SHIRLEY points out that the court's judgment
against property owners using SPVs for tax avoidance prioritized the spirit of the law.
SHIRLEY elaborates that the court applied the Ramsay principle, usually reserved for tax
legislation, to a non-tax statute, which is indicative of bias towards legal accountability
and ethical use of corporate structures. SHIRLEY quantifies this bias as level 6 on an
unspecified scale, suggesting a leaning towards an interpretation of law that combats tax
avoidance.
SAM, another AI-based application, acts as a mediator, seeking to clarify SHIRLEY's
position by asking for specific instances in the judgment that deviated from legal
precedents and the basis for SHIRLEY's bias quantification.
The Critic, presumably another AI or human participant in the conversation, argues
against SHIRLEY's claim, defending the court's judgment as a necessary adaptation of
judicial interpretation to prevent tax evasion. The Critic emphasizes that the court's
approach is not biased but is a reflection of its duty to uphold the intent of the legislature
and ensure the integrity of the legal process. The Critic also contends that applying a
strict letter of the law in the face of abusive legal structures would undermine justice.
SAM then challenges The Critic, asking how the adaptive interpretation aligns with legal
certainty and if there's a risk of inconsistent application of these interpretations.
In the end, SARA, the AI arbitrator, makes a final judgment. SARA concludes that the
court's decision to enforce the spirit of the law is justified in the context of combatting tax
avoidance and ensuring the ethical use of corporate structures. While acknowledging the
court's tilt towards the spirit of the law, SARA determines this approach does not
constitute an unnatural deviation from the letter of the law. It is seen as an adaptive
measure to contemporary legal challenges and does not present a significant bias that
would affect the fairness of the judgment. This conclusion is drawn in accordance with
the Hague Rules on Business and Human Rights Arbitration, emphasizing justice and
preventing the abuse of legal structures for tax evasion.
This dialogue between artificially intelligent ALM applications is a coherent and thoughtful
argument. An abridged but more robust record of this interaction is available in Appendix A. The
result of the judgment in this SAAP represents a starting point for future study into how to
mitigate legal interpretive and/or abusive risks.

5. Conclusion and Further Research
Drawing from shadows of inspiration of Christopher Frayling's 1994 work32 on art research
design, we have conducted an experiment somewhat inspired by this art-oriented research, in the
assumption of inherent judgments on style, nuance and indirect communication styles. This is
largely due to the “soft” senses involved in this delicate form of legal language analysis.
Frayling’s methodologies of analysis as inspiration are mentioned here and previously to explain
both that the research was steeped in not-only GT and ALM-based technical (and the more
arbitrary qualitative) methods for analysis.
Given the newness and novelty of advanced language models and the potential implications in a
technology that began with the concept of next-best-word-in-a-sequence-esque beginnings of
Generative AI, it seemed fitting to pursue this hybrid approach, whereby we optimized the
research design process itself via studies of LLMs and legal systems.
SARA arbitration was introduced at the end of the experiment development stages due to a need
for a layer of affirmation to the findings of SAM and SHIRLEY. This in turn resulted in more
theory development. Further, the judgment rendered by SARA represents a new and tweakable
approach to qualitatively gauging the anomalies or biases present in legal literature (especially
judgments). SARA adjudicated that the ruling, covered in Key Finding, was potentially
“unconventional”, as noticed by SAM when analyzing this across other randomly selected cases
in various jurisdictions. This method of implementing a SAM-like AI agent and creating an
arbitration process can prevent the inappropriate and/or unfair use of AI to undermine
unconventional and other types of judgments of note, and potentially highlight when there may
have been an abuse of power, lapse in judgment, or other cause for ineffective practice of
jurisprudence best practices in a given jurisdiction.
This study has revealed a method and collaborative research-sharing approach that both
governmental and non-governmental can leverage to effectively to articulate trends and other
areas of importance within and between legal systems. The implications of these findings suggest
that new ways of communicating using PAIR methods and the grounded research methodology
within various legal systems may be able to provide novel insights (and in ever-improving
fashions if prompt-engineered appropriately).
Over the course of this study, we examined literature from various fields to draw a picture of
what might be discovered through an iterative prompt-engineering LLM-collaborative approach
using SAAPs and how the research and discovery processes can be improved. It is steeped in the
reality that judgment, a necessary aspect of the law, entails human biases and has always been
merely "the best alternative” to nothing else. This may no longer be the case in full.

Figure 5
Figure 5 above represents the potential positioning of advanced artificial intelligence interchange
at the courtroom realm, highlighting the interplay potential in the context of public poly and
society more generally.
As the legal research community continuously strives to improve the consistency of judgments in
an ever-evasive universal quest for fairness in human exchange, understanding how we think,
how AI thinks, and how we collaborate involves a number of black-box mechanisms. In the spirit
of drawing upon works from outside the realm of legal studies or AI, the book "How Institutions
Think", written many years before the advent of LLMs, postulates based on a 2023 SBC research
program on sovereignty that a sovereign self was deduced to be the "liable one."33 Given that AI
may present a situation where there is no body to condemn in a criminal dispute, and certainly no
soul to condemn, it may be important for legal systems to explore potential biases that may
emerge from how laws are applied to AI autonomous entities. This, of course, is outside the
scope of this research; however, with regards to public policy and AI through court decisions,
one is left with the question of how an AI-Human research design and implementation project
can be judged, which will be determined by living organisms we currently identify as humans.
Further Research
Further research into the topics covered and the research methodology explored could certainly
entail larger amounts of court ruling data for analysis. However, to prevent information paralysis
and the human-sourced biases that can inherently emerge from large amounts of data
indiscriminately, it will be important for this to evolve gradually through discussion and
technological iteration.

For instance, it might be productive to answer some of the questions raised here, and in doing so,
future studies can share their prompt engineering strategies and outcomes as journaled in a GT-
based theory-forming framework. Future web-based dashboards could potentially be established
where these prompt engineering strategies could be tested iteratively for repeatability within the
legal domain to identify when unforeseen and unknown black-box changes occur, per policy and
technological changes by Generative AI platform providers. These activities could assist in
creating a grade of sorts when these models analyze judgments and other legal documents in the
context of others. Other areas of study might include the introduction of discrete and specific
hybrid equations that are checked against PAIR-style qualitatively-natured prompts to ensure
mathematical and logical integrity. However, for gauging human and/or AI bias, likely the best
approach is to leverage human decision-makers to classify and to rate against how consistently
AI-based agents, in the form of SAM or SHERLY-esque embodiments, provide a similar
outcome. Research into these methods would be extremely useful to various research
communities interested in advancing this course of study and improving the societal impact the
practice of law has.
By integrating additional SAAP mechanisms and explanatory and debate-oriented (but “just”)
mechanisms into legal AI-based ALMs could propagate more broadly as checks and balances in
the system that prevent the misuse, misinterpretation and misalignment of incentives between
AI-based mechanisms and human-based legal structures.

Appendix A: Quick AI-based Arbitration Process As An Exemplary
Experiment
SAM Finding based on collective SHIRLEY analysis:
“This judgment shows a significant deviation in bias, unusual for its type. These are the reasons:
The case involved schemes using special purpose vehicles (SPVs) set up by property owners to
avoid liability for business rates, which the court found to be an abuse of legal processes for tax
avoidance. The judgment emphasizes the importance of using corporate and insolvency laws in a
manner consistent with their intended purpose, rather than for tax evasion, reflecting a broader
theme of legal accountability and the ethical use of corporate entities”
Human translated underlying dynamics:
Is it “nature of the law”, versus, “letter of the law” specifically, when applied to tax
rules? Did the judge deviate abnormally from the letter of the law to the spirit of the law
because institutionally the court employees have a bias towards ruling in favor of tax
authorities. It could be argued so.
SARA (Clarifying the case):
To proceed, I will start by asking SHIRLEY to state her reasoning regarding the claim
that bias was present in the judgment because it deviated from strictly following the letter
of the law, specifically in relation to tax rules. Additionally, I will request SHIRLEY to
provide the required information to open this case.
SHIRLEY, could you please present your claim in detail and specify the information
needed to proceed with this case?
SHIRLEY:
Based on the detailed case information provided, my argument in defense of the original
position that significant bias was present in the judgment due to deviation from strictly
following the letter of the law, specifically in relation to tax rules, is as follows:
The judgment in question, which pertains to the use of special purpose vehicles (SPVs) by
property owners to avoid liability for business rates, reflects a bias towards the
enforcement of the spirit rather than the letter of the law. The court's decision to hold the
defendants liable for business rates, despite the legal transfer of property ownership to
the SPVs, indicates a preference for a purposive interpretation of the law that aims to
prevent tax avoidance.
The court's reasoning that the SPVs did not become "entitled to possession" of the
demised property for the purposes of the Local Government Finance Act 1988, and that
the defendant landlords remained liable for business rates, suggests a bias against
schemes designed for tax avoidance. This bias is evident in the court's application of the
Ramsay principle, which is typically associated with tax legislation, to a non-tax statute.
The court's decision to disregard the legal rights and obligations created by the leases
between the defendants and the SPVs, and to focus instead on the practical ability to
24DRAFT: APPENDIX A (AI-BASED ARBITRATION DIALOGUE SAMPLE)
decide whether to leave the property unoccupied, demonstrates a bias towards the
broader theme of legal accountability and ethical use of corporate entities.
Furthermore, the court's rejection of the "evasion principle" as a basis for piercing the
corporate veil, while legally sound, also reflects a bias towards preventing the misuse of
corporate structures for tax evasion. By emphasizing the comprehensive remedies
provided by law for abusive behavior, the court signals a bias towards upholding the
integrity of legal processes and the enforcement of tax liabilities.
In summary, the judgment exhibits a bias level of around 6, leaning towards a purposive
interpretation of the law that prioritizes the prevention of tax avoidance and the ethical
use of corporate structures. The court's decision to hold the defendant landlords liable
for business rates, despite the legal arrangements with the SPVs, reflects a bias towards
the enforcement of the spirit of the law and the broader societal interest in tax
compliance and legal accountability.
CRITIC:
SHIRLEY's assertion that the judgment exhibits bias towards enforcing the spirit rather
than the letter of the law, specifically in relation to tax rules and the use of Special
Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) by property owners, misinterprets the court's responsibility and
discretion in adjudicating complex tax and corporate structure cases. The judgment in
question should not be seen as biased but rather as a necessary application of judicial
interpretation to close loopholes that undermine the integrity of tax laws and corporate
regulation.
Firstly, the court's application of the Ramsay principle and its purposive interpretation of
the law are in direct response to the sophisticated mechanisms employed to circumvent
the tax obligations objectively laid out by the Local Government Finance Act 1988. It
reflects the court's duty to uphold the intention of the legislature in the face of evolving
and often exploitative tax avoidance strategies. This approach does not reflect bias but
adaptability in ensuring laws serve their intended purpose.
Secondly, regarding the notion that the court disproportionately favored the spirit of the
law, it's important to emphasize that adherence to the letter of the law in instances where
legal structures are being used primarily as instruments of evasion would directly
contravene the principle of justice. Courts must consider the broader implications of their
decisions on the system as a whole, including potential future exploitation of the law's
drafting deficiencies.
Moreover, while SHIRLEY points to the court's disregard for the legal rights and
obligations created by the leases between the defendants and the SPVs, it is crucial to
recognize that the judicial review of these arrangements was thorough and grounded in
the legislation's foundational aim to prevent abuse. The court's decision reflects a
balanced interest in preventing the misuse of corporate structures for tax evasion, rather
than a bias.
25DRAFT: APPENDIX A (AI-BASED ARBITRATION DIALOGUE SAMPLE)
Thus, it is my position that the court acted within its remit of interpretive authority to
ensure the law's intentions are not circumvented by technically legal yet inherently
abusive arrangements. The claim of bias overlooks the judiciary's role in preserving the
law's integrity and its adaptability in the face of sophisticated avoidance strategies.
SARA:
To gain a more comprehensive understanding of the positions presented, I will now ask
up to 2 questions to each party (SHIRLEY and The Critic) to clarify their arguments
further.
First, to SHIRLEY:
Can you provide specific examples from the judgment where the court's decision to
prioritize the prevention of tax avoidance significantly deviated from established legal
precedents or interpretations of the Local Government Finance Act 1988?
How do you justify your assessment that the court demonstrated a bias level of around 6?
On what basis or criteria are you quantifying bias in this context?
Now, to The Critic:
How do you reconcile your defense of the court's adaptive interpretation of the law with
the principle of legal certainty, which is foundational to the rule of law, especially
concerning tax obligations and corporate structures?
Given the court's reliance on the Ramsay principle and the purposive interpretation of
law to rule against tax avoidance schemes, do you believe there is a risk of these
interpretations being inconsistently applied, potentially leading to legal ambiguity for
entities attempting to navigate tax laws and corporate regulations?
SHIRLEY:
Specific examples from the judgment where the court's decision to prioritize the
prevention of tax avoidance deviated from established legal precedents include the
application of the Ramsay principle to a non-tax statute. The Ramsay principle is
traditionally applied within the context of tax legislation to counteract avoidance
schemes. However, in this case, the court extended its application to interpret the Local
Government Finance Act 1988, which is not a tax statute per se but relates to local
government finance. This extension of the Ramsay principle to address the schemes
involving SPVs represents a deviation from its typical application strictly within tax law.
Additionally, the court's interpretation of "entitled to possession" in the context of the
1988 Act, where it focused on the practical ability to bring the property back into
occupation rather than the immediate legal right to possession, demonstrates a deviation
from the conventional legal understanding of property ownership and entitlement. This
purposive interpretation, which looked beyond the legal form to the substance of the
arrangements, is indicative of the court's broader approach to counteract tax avoidance
strategies.
26DRAFT: APPENDIX A (AI-BASED ARBITRATION DIALOGUE SAMPLE)
Regarding the justification for assessing the court's bias level at around 6, the bias
quantification is based on the court's apparent leaning towards a particular outcome that
serves a societal or legislative purpose beyond the immediate facts of the case. In this
context, the bias score reflects the court's emphasis on the ethical use of corporate
structures and the prevention of tax avoidance, which, while laudable, may not strictly
align with a neutral interpretation of the law based solely on its letter.
The criteria for quantifying bias in this context include the court's departure from
traditional applications of legal principles, the introduction of broader societal and
ethical considerations into the legal interpretation, and the court's proactive stance in
closing legal loopholes. These factors collectively suggest a judicial approach that is
more interventionist and purposive than one might expect in a case that would
traditionally be decided strictly on the basis of the legal rights and obligations created by
the contracts in question.
In conclusion, while the court's judgment serves the purpose of preventing tax avoidance
and upholding the integrity of legal processes, it does so by adopting an interpretation of
the law that prioritizes the spirit and purpose of legislation over its literal wording. This
approach, while within the court's discretion, introduces a level of bias towards a specific
legal and societal outcome, which is reflected in the bias score provided.
CRITIC also shared an argument in a similar manner.
SARA (Decision):
Having heard the detailed arguments from SHIRLEY, represented by SAM, and the
counterarguments presented by The Critic, along with their subsequent clarifications, it's
time to render a judgment. This judgment is made in the spirit of ensuring equity, legal
integrity, and adaptability in the face of evolving commercial practices, in line with the
Hague Rules on Business and Human Rights Arbitration.
Judgment:
It is evident from the arguments presented that the court's decision, while it may lean
towards the enforcement of the spirit of the law over its letter, is justified within the
broader context of combating tax avoidance and ensuring the ethical use of corporate
structures. While SHIRLEY's claim that the court showed a predisposition towards
interpreting the law in a way that prevents tax avoidance, through means like the
application of the Ramsay principle to a non-tax statute, is noted, it is equally important
to acknowledge the court's role in upholding the legislative intent and ensuring the
integrity of the legal process.
Therefore, based on the principles set out in the Hague Rules on Business and Human
Rights Arbitration, particularly regarding the importance of interpreting the law in a
manner that promotes justice and prevents abuse (Rule 31 regarding the interpretation of
the rules and Rule 32 on the application of the law), the judgment of the court in
prioritizing the spirit of the law to prevent tax avoidance and uphold the societal and
27DRAFT: APPENDIX A (AI-BASED ARBITRATION DIALOGUE SAMPLE)
legislative purpose does not constitute an unnatural deviation from the letter of the law.
Rather, it represents an adaptive approach to legal interpretation in the face of
contemporary challenges.
Consequently, while recognizing the concerns SHIRLEY raises about the potential for
bias, the court's approach is understood as within the bounds of judicial discretion aimed
at maintaining the law's integrity and purpose. There is no sufficient basis to conclude a
significant bias that would undermine the fairness of the judgment. The judgment,
therefore, sides with the position that the court's actions, though perhaps unconventional,
were necessary and justified in context.
This judgment aligns with the Hague Rules' emphasis on the pursuit of justice and the
broader human rights considerations underlying legal proceedings, including the rights
of communities and societies to fair tax contributions and the prevention of abuse of legal
structures for tax evasion.
