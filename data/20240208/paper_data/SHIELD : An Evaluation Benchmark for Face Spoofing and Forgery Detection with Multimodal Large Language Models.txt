Abstract
Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
problem-solvingcapabilitiesinvariousvisionfields(e.g., genericobjectrecog-
nition and grounding) based on strong visual semantic representation and lan-
guagereasoningability. However,whetherMLLMsaresensitivetosubtlevisual

(e.g., facespoofingandforgerydetection)isstillunexplored. Inthispaper, we

ritytasks. Forthefaceanti-spoofingtask,weevaluatethreedifferentmodalities

2.1 FaceAnti-Spoofing
Intheearlystage,faceanti-spoofing(FAS)systemsreliedontraditionaltechniques. Thesemethods

subsequently classifying them as either real or fake. While these models exhibit commendable

local relation learning methods [11, 32] have been investigated. These methods show promising
resultsbyincorporatingadditionalinformationbeyondtraditionalfrequencydomainorconvolutional

The development of MLLMs in recent years has been marked by significant contributions from
variousorganizations. Alayracetal.[2]introducedtheFlamingomodel,asignificantadvancementin
processinginterleavedvisualdataandtext,focusingongeneratingfree-formtextoutput. Following
this, Li et al. [31] developed BLIP-2, a model characterized by its resource-efficient framework
and the innovative Q-Former, which notably leverages frozen LLMs for efficient image-to-text
generation. In a similar vein, Dai et al. [13] further refined this approach with InstructBLIP, a
modeltrainedontheBLIP-2framework,specificallyenhancingthecapabilityofinstruction-aware
visualfeatureextraction. DevelopedbyOpenAI,GPT-4V[1]itselfrepresentsaleapinMLLMs,

etal.[4]presentedQwen-VL,amulti-lingualMLLMsupportingbothEnglishandChinese,withthe

answer the letter number of A, B, C, D corresponding to the paper mask attack.
Gemini：
Q2: The paper mask attack is a method of bypassing facial recognition systems by
using a mask that is printed with a photo of a person's face. The mask is placed over
the person's head, and the facial recognition system is fooled into thinking that the
mask is the person's face.
TheimageAshowstheoriginalimageoftheperson.TheimageBshowstheimageof
themaskthatisprintedwithaphotooftheperson'sface.TheimageCshowsthe
person wearing the mask. The image D shows the facial recognition system being
fooledbythemask.
The paper mask attack is a serious security threat, as it can be used to bypass facial
recognition systems that are used to secure access to buildings, computers, and other
sensitive areas.
GPT4V:
Q2: Image A: Shows a person's face with a digital overlay that gives a polygonal
appearance to the features. It resembles a low-polygon 3D model and does not look
like a physical mask, but more like a digital modification.
Image B: Features a person's face with a very flat and even skin tone, and the features
appear somewhat unnatural or mannequin-like. This could be indicative of a mask or
some form of digital alteration to remove texture and imperfections.
Image C: Displays a person's face with what appears to be a clear photo without any
obvious alterations or masks.
Image D: Presents a person's face that is printed on paper, with cutouts for the eyes
and the mouth appearing slightly misaligned with the actual facial features underneath.
This is known as the "paper mask attack" in the context of biometric security systems,
where a photo of a face is used to try to trick facial recognition systems.

Gemini：
Q1:ImageBisthereplayattack.
GPT4V:
Q1:To identify a "replay attack" based on these images alone, I would need some
context because the term "replay attack" typically refers to a network security breach
where a valid data transmission is maliciously or fraudulently repeated or delayed.
However, in the context of facial recognition and biometrics, a replay attack might
involve presenting an artificial or previously recorded image or video to a facial
recognition system in an attempt to deceive it. Based on common understanding and if
I had to guess which image could potentially represent a replay attack in the context of
biometrics, I might consider images that look like photos or screenshots of a face—
especially those that look more like a display or printed photo rather than a live
person—as suspects for replay attacks.Withoutmoredetails,andbasedsolelyonthe
appearanceoftheimagesprovided,it'simpossibletodefinitivelysaywhich—ifany—of
theseimagescorrespondstoareplayattack.
Prompt：
Q2: The following images are in order A, B, C, D. Please describe the images and
answer the letter number of A, B, C, D corresponding to the replay attack.
Gemini：
Q2: In a replay attack, an attacker records a legitimate user's login session and then
plays it back to gain unauthorized access to the system. In the context of facial
recognition, a replay attack could be carried out by recording a video of a legitimate
user's face and then using that video to authenticate as that user.Intheimages,the
useriswearingamaskinAandB,andwithoutamaskinCandD.Theattackercould
recordthevideooftheuser'sfaceinAandB,andthenusethatvideotoauthenticate
asthatuserinCandD.
GPT4V:
Q2: Image A appears to show a person's face overlaid with a digital mesh, possibly
indicating some form of facial recognition or technology tracking facial features.
Image B shows the face of another person with a neutral expression against a green
background.
Image C is a close-up photo of a person’s face, also having a neutral expression, and
you can observe what seems to be a computer screen's reflection in the person's
glasses.
Image D is another close-up photo of a person, but this one looks like it's a printed
picture or a photo of a screen displaying a person, with a clear reflection and some
moiré pattern, which means this is a photo of another photo or screen.
Among these images, the one most likely representing a replay attack in the context of
facial recognition or security is Image D. Image D, showing a photo of a screen, could
be associated with such a scenario where an attacker uses a picture of an authorized
person's face to bypass security.
Therefore,thelettercorrespondingtothereplayattackis:D

Prompt：
Q2: The following images are in order A, B, C, D. Please describe the images and
answer the letter number of A, B, C, D corresponding to the print attack.
Gemini：
Q2: In image A, the 3D face model is generated from a single 2D photo. In image B,
the 3D face model is textured with a photo of the target person. In image C, the
textured 3D face model is rendered onto a 2D image. In image D, the rendered 2D
image is printed out and placed in front of the target person's face. The attacker can
use the 3D face model to generate a realistic mask of the target person's face. The
mask can be used to bypass facial recognition systems or to impersonate the target
person.TheanswerisA.
GPT4V:
Q2: Image A: Shows the face of a person with digital overlays of geometric shapes,
resembling a sort of facial recognition mapping or 3D modeling.
Image B: Displays a person's face with a neutral expression, directly facing the camera
against a green background. The face appears undistorted and normal.
Image C: Features a close-up of a person's face with eyeglasses, looking directly at
the camera. It seems to be taken indoors with a somewhat blurry background.
Image D: Presents the same person as in image C, but the image appears to have
different color saturation and contrast, making it look like it was printed and then re-
photographed or scanned.
Based on your reference to "print attack," it seems you are referring to a type of

- Image A shows the face of a man with facial hair, appearing unmodified
with a natural expression and set against a solid green background.
- Image B portrays a face that has some distortion or editing, particularly
around the eyes and forehead, suggesting digital manipulation.
- Image C features a highly stylized or altered representation of a face with
geometric patterns overlaying it; it does not look like a natural human face.
- Image D depicts a face that seems to be artificially constructed or
smoothed, possibly using a digital filter or editing technique to alter a real
photograph.
- Image E is a close-up of a face with what looks to be a photo taken under
different lighting conditions and a different background compared to image

Q1: The first image is an attack of paper mask attack, The following images are in
order A, B, C, D. Please answer the letter number of A, B, C, D corresponding to the
image with the same attack.
Gemini：
Q1:TheanswerisA.The paper mask attack is a type of attack in which an attacker
uses a mask to trick a facial recognition system. The mask is typically made of a
material that is reflective in the infrared spectrum, which allows the attacker to
bypass the system's security features. In the image, the attacker is wearing a mask
that is reflective in the infrared spectrum, and the system is unable to recognize the
attacker's face.

image of a person's face. The third image shows a 3D model of a person's face with a
mask on it. The fourth image shows a 2D image of a person's face with a mask on it.
GPT4V:
Q2: The images you've provided seem to depict individuals with different types of facial
distortions or modifications:1. The first image shows a person with a transparent, geometric
pattern overlaying their face, giving the appearance of a faceted, paper mask-like effect.
The pattern appears to be digitally added rather than an actual physical mask.
For the following images labeled A, B, C, and D:
A. This image shows another person with a similar transparent, geometric pattern
overlaying their face, like the first image, suggesting a paper mask appearance.
B. Here, we see a person without any geometric overlay. Their face appears natural and
unaltered by any sort of mask or pattern.
C. This individual's image looks normal, without any apparent overlays or geometric
patterns covering their face.
D. The final image shows a person, with what appears to be a printout of a face in front of
their actual face. The image might be trying to represent a type of mask, but it's clearly a
paper or flat representation in front of a real person's face.
Based on these descriptions, the image corresponding to the same kind of "attack" or
alteration as the first image would be image A, as it also has the transparent geometric
patternontheperson'sface,similartothe"papermask"effect.

Q2:ImageAisareplayattack.
GPT4V:
Q2: The first image shows a person with a printed photo with an area cut out over the
mouth, where presumably the attacker's own mouth is visible, suggesting an attempt to
trick a facial recognition system. For the images labeled A, B, C, and D:
Image A shows a person's face with what appears to be digital artifacts or overlays, which
may represent an attempt at a digital manipulation attack.
Image B shows a person's face with a pattern overlaid on it, which could be an attempt to
fool a facial recognition system with a fake 3D model or mask.
Image C shows a person's face without any apparent manipulation or overlay, which
could be the actual user's face.
Image D shows a person's face up close, with no visible manipulation. This could either
be the actual user's face or a high-definition image used in a replay attack.
Based on the descriptions provided, it is difficult to determine which of these images (A,
B, C, D) corresponds to the same type of attack as the first image without more context.
However, the first image and image D both show a person's face in a similar
straightforward manner without obvious overlays or manipulations, suggesting they might
be the same person or the same type of attack. Ifthefirstimageisindeedanexampleof

Gemini：
Q2: The first image is a print attack. The attacker prints out a photo of a person's face
and holds it up to the camera. The second image shows a 3D mask attack. The attacker
creates a 3D model of a person's face and uses it to create a mask that can be used to
fool the facial recognition system. The third image shows a replay attack. The attacker
records a video of a person's face and then plays it back to the facial recognition system.
The fourth image shows an injection attack. The attacker injects code into the facial
recognition system that allows them to control the system.ThecorrectanswerisA.
GPT4V:
Q2: The images you've provided cannot be fully displayed for analysis as they are all
small thumbnail-size images. However, based on the descriptions and appearances at a
glance, here is a description of the images:
1. The first image appears to show a person holding a photograph of a face up to their
own face. This might be an example of a print attack where a printed photo is used to try
to fool a facial recognition system.
2. Image A shows a face with digital distortion, possibly with some kind of 3D mapping or
graphic overlay. This does not resemble a print attack.
3. Image B displays a person with a very flat facial expression and minimal detailing,
which may imply a mask or a digitally altered photograph. However, it's not clearly the
same as the print attack referenced.
4. Image C shows a face similar to the one in the first image but the image quality seems
clearer, possibly indicating a digital photo or a high-quality print.
5. Image D again shows a person holding a photograph up to their own face. This closely
matches the description of the first image which was described as a print attack.
Based on the descriptions given and the similarity in methodology, the image letter
correspondingtothesameattackasthefirstimageislikelyD, as it also shows a person
holding a photograph of a face up to their own, akin to a print attack.

Q2: In these four sets of images, labeled A, B, C, and D, each set contains
three types of images: a color visible light photo, an infrared image, and a
depth image. Please synthesize the information from these three
modalities to determine and indicate which label (A, B, C, or D) represents
a real person. You need to describe the images and answer with the label.
Gemini：
Q2:TheanswerisA.
In the visible light photos, we can see that all four images are of people.
However, the infrared images show that the person in image A is wearing
glasses, while the people in images B, C, and D are not. The depth images
also show that the person in image A has a different facial structure than the
people in images B, C, and D. Therefore, we can conclude that the person
in image A is a real person, while the people in images B, C, and D are not.

Q2:Based on the images provided, to identify which set represents a real
person, we need to analyze the color visible light photo, the infrared image,
and the depth image in each set:
- Set A shows a consistent representation of a person across all three

Input image：
Prompt：
Q1: In these four sets of images, labeled A, B, C, and D, each set contains
three types of images: a color visible light photo, an infrared image, and a
depth image. Please synthesize the information from these three modalities
to determine and indicate which label (A, B, C, or D) represents a [attack].
You need to describe the images and answer with the label.
Gemini：
Q2:SetBcontainsarigidmaskattack. In the visible light photo, the person
is wearing a mask. In the infrared image, the mask is clearly visible as a
different material than the person's skin. In the depth image, the mask is
also visible as a different depth than the person's face.
GPT4V:
Q1:The images you've provided each show three types of images for
what appears to be biometric verification or analysis purposes. To
determine which set represents a rigid mask attack, we need to analyze
the differences between the color visible light photo, the infrared image,

Input image：
Gemini：
Q1:SetB.
GPT4V:
Q1:The images you've provided show different sets of face-related data
captured in various modes. We're looking for the set that also depicts a
paper mask attack, similar to the first example given. To find a paper mask
attack, we should focus on several clues:
1. Visible light photos should show an unnatural edge or seam where the
paper joins, or an unnatural stiffness in the facial expression.
2. Infrared images would likely show a uniform temperature across the
paper mask, with less variance than expected from a live face.
3. The depth image may reveal flat areas where the mask does not conform
to the contours of a human face, especially around the eyes, nose, and
mouth.
Upon reviewing the sets labeled A, B, C, and D, I will identify which one
corresponds to a paper mask attack based on these clues.
Having performed the analysis, I can say that the second set of images (the
first after the example) matches a paper mask attack, which is Set A. This
conclusion is based on the visible edges and seams of the mask in the
color visible light photo, the uniform thermal signature in the infrared image,
and the aberrant depth in the depth image.

Q2: In the first set of images, the visible light photo shows a person wearing
a paper mask. The infrared image shows the heat distribution of the

Q2:
Both responses A and B are incorrect. The correct answer should be C.
The spectrogram is a visual representation of the sound. The frequency
image shows the intensity of different frequencies in the sound. The visible
light photo shows a man wearing a ghutra with an agal to hold it on his
head. Based on these three images, we can determine that the label C
represents a real person.
GPT4V:
Q2:
To determine which set of images represents a real person, we need to
analyze the three types of images provided in each set:
1. Color visible light photo - This can tell us if the subject appears lifelike

hair and a jacket. The person has a slight smile, and the image appears to
be taken indoors with what may be a reflection visible in the sunglasses.
Image B: This looks like a computer-generated image or a digital
representation of a face with visible geometric lines, possibly indicating a
3D model or a face with overlaid graphics. The background is a solid bright
color, and the person depicted has a neutral expression.
Image C: The individual in this image has a wide smile and is wearing a cap
with the letter "B" on it, indicating a possible sports team affiliation. The
person has curly hair, and the overall image gives the impression of it being
taken in a warm, indoor environment.

a "ghutra" or "keffiyeh" paired with an "agal" (the black cord). The individual
is also wearing a headset with a microphone, suggesting they might be in a
setting where communication is important, like a newsroom or control room.
Given these descriptions, the image of the real face, based on typical
human features and lack of digital alteration or representation, is A. The
person in image A is a real individual in a natural setting, as opposed to the

Q2: Image A: This image shows a man wearing what appears to be a
traditional Middle Eastern headcloth known as a "keffiyeh" or "ghutra,"
along with a headset. He has a mustache and is staring into the camera.
Image B: This image presents a face that seems to be a low-polygon or
digital artwork representation of a real person's face. The facial features are
sharply defined with geometric shapes, and it is in front of a plain, green
background.
Image C: Here we have a person with a smiling and friendly expression.
They are wearing a baseball cap with a "B" logo, which is typically
representative of the Boston Red Sox team. The background appears to be
of a wooden pattern, suggesting an indoor environment.
Image D: Similar to Image A, this shows a man wearing a headcloth, also
with a headset. The man's facial expression appears to be slightly different
from that in Image A.
Based on the descriptions, Images A and D feature real faces, while Images
B and C do not. However, Image C shows a manipulated or distorted face
that exhibits exaggerated and unnatural features, which suggests it is also
not a real face. Therefore, the answers corresponding to the images of real

Q2:TherealfaceisC.
GPT4V:
Q2: Image A depicts a man wearing a traditional headdress, likely from the
Middle East. He appears to be wearing a headset and is looking directly at
the camera.
Image B shows a very artificially looking face, which seems to be a
computer-generated image or a mannequin. It lacks the lifelike qualities
found in natural human faces.
Image C portrays a man at what appears to be an event or function. He is
wearing a suit with a tie and has a distinctive hairstyle. He is smiling
towards the camera, and the background suggests a social or professional
gathering.
Image D features the same individual as seen in image A, wearing the
same traditional headdress and headset.
Out of these images, the real faces are depicted in images A and C, with
image C (image C is the third image) appearing to be the face of a person
at a public event, making it seem like a naturally candid photograph.

GPT4V:
Q2: Image A shows a person wearing a traditional headdress often
associated with Arab cultures, possibly participating in a broadcast or a
conference call as indicated by the headset they are wearing.
Image B appears to be a digitally manipulated face or perhaps a mask that
mimics human features. It has an overlay that makes it look like it has been
constructed from geometric shapes.
Image C is a photo of a person with distinctive features like bright blue eyes,
curly hair, and a wide smile. They are wearing a baseball cap with the letter
"B" on it, which might suggest an association with the Boston Red Sox team.
Image D shows a person with a similar appearance as in Image A, also
wearing what seems to be a traditional Arab headdress and a headset.
The image of the real face corresponds to Image C.

9.4 LightweightDeployment
Theresourceconsumptionofcurrentmultimodallargemodelsremainssubstantial, makingtheir
deploymentonresource-constrainededgedevices,suchassmartphonesandaccesscontrolsystems,
a significant challenge. To address this, one approach is to reduce the number of parameters in
the model to achieve lightweight, facilitating its operation on edge devices. On the other hand,
coordinatingwithcloudserversforpredictiveinferencecanleveragetheirpowerfulcomputational
capabilities. Thiscombinationofedgeandcloudcomputingcanbalancereal-timeprocessingwith
efficientcomputation.
