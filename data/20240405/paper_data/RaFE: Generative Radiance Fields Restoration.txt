Abstract. NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields) has demonstrated tremen-
dous potential in novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction, but its per-
formance is sensitive to input image quality, which struggles to achieve
high-fidelityrenderingwhenprovidedwithlow-qualitysparseinputview-
points. Previous methods for NeRF restoration are tailored for specific
degradation type, ignoring the generality of restoration. To overcome
this limitation, we propose a generic radiance fields restoration pipeline,
named RaFE, which applies to various types of degradations, such as
low resolution, blurriness, noise, compression artifacts, or their combina-
tions. Our approach leverages the success of off-the-shelf 2D restoration
methods to recover the multi-view images individually. Instead of re-
constructing a blurred NeRF by averaging inconsistencies, we introduce
a novel approach using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for
NeRF generation to better accommodate the geometric and appearance
inconsistencies present in the multi-view images. Specifically, we adopt
a two-level tri-plane architecture, where the coarse level remains fixed
to represent the low-quality NeRF, and a fine-level residual tri-plane to
be added to the coarse level is modeled as a distribution with GAN to
capture potential variations in restoration. We validate RaFE on both
synthetic and real cases for various restoration tasks, demonstrating su-
perior performance in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, sur-
passing other 3D restoration methods specific to single task. Please see

1 Introduction
Recently, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) [3,4,7,12,30,31,37,40] have achieved
great success in novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction. However, most
NeRF methods are designed based on well-captured images from multiple views
with calibrated camera parameters. In real-world applications of NeRF, the data
capture or transmission process often introduces various forms of image degrada-
tions, such as noise generated during photography in low-light conditions [28,32]

and blur caused by camera motion [26,43], or JPEG compression and down-
sampling during transmission [2,42]. Simply restoring degraded images frame-by-
frame can result in inconsistencies of geometry and appearance across different
viewpoints. Directly reconstructing 3D models over these per-frame restoration
results can easily induce inferior quality since current NeRF methods heavily
rely on pixel-wise independent ray optimization with local computations, which

Several NeRF variants have attempted to reconstruct 3D scenes with de-
graded multi-view images by introducing specific strategies or additional con-
straints for the optimization of radiance fields. For example, [19,20,26] deal with
image blur artifacts by modeling the degradation kernel with NeRF, while [2,42]
super-sampling on rays or tri-planes to obtain high-resolution 3D from low-
resolution observations. Additionally, [30] modifies NeRF to reconstruct the
scene in linear HDR space by supervising directly on noisy raw images to ad-
dress the noise generated in low-light conditions. [52] tries to improve the view
synthesis quality by removing NeRF-specific rendering artifacts. Even with great
success, all these approaches are only designed to handle specific types of degra-
dation. To the best of our knowledge, currently there is no generic pipeline which
supports the restoration of radiance fields under various types of degradation.
In this paper, we propose RaFE, a generic NeRF restoration framework that
enables high-quality radiance fields reconstruction from captured images con-
taining various types of degradation in a generative manner. Firstly, we leverage
the success of off-the-shelf image restoration methods to restore the multi-view
images with different forms of degradation, such as super-resolution, deblurring,
denoising, removing compression artifacts or a combination thereof. It is im-
portant to note that since the images from different views are independently
restored, there inevitably exist geometric and appearance inconsistencies be-
tween them. Naively optimizing a radiance field with these refined images would
average out the inconsistencies and result in blurry outputs. To overcome this
challenge, our insight here is, instead of describing a single 3D using inconsistent
frames, we could consider these restored multi-view images as the renderingsRaFE: Generative Radiance Fields Restoration 3
from multiple distinct high-quality NeRF models with varied geometry and ap-
pearance. In this case, we abandon the commonly-used pixel-wise reconstruction
objective and propose to leverage the generative adversarial networks (GANs) to
model the distribution of these different high-quality NeRF models, which could
effectively capture the inherent variability in ill-posed inverse problem, allowing
for a better accommodation of the inconsistencies present in different views.
Specifically, our pipeline consists of two main stages. In the first stage, based
on the type of degradation, we can employ the corresponding off-the-shelf image
restoration methods [17,25,33,34,45,48] to obtain a set of high-quality multi-
view images. In practice, we prefer choosing restoration methods which have
strong capabilities to recover high-quality and realistic texture details. In the
second stage, we train a 3D generative model based on these restored multi-view
images. Drawing inspirations from recent 3D generation works [6,9,36,39], we
construct a convolutional neural network (CNN) to generate tri-plane features,
which are subsequently sampled and decoded into density and colors using MLP
networks for NeRF rendering. Here, instead of generating single-level tri-plane
features as previous works did, we decompose the tri-planes into two levels. The
coarse-level tri-planes are constructed directly from low-quality images and re-
main fixed during training, representing the coarse structure of the modeled 3D
distribution. Simultaneously, we train a generator to output the diverse fine-level
tri-plane features, which act as residuals to be added to the coarse-level features
for NeRF rendering. By focusing on learning the residual representations in-
stead of the entire tri-planes for NeRF, we simplify the modeling and learning
of restoration variations since we only need to learn the details while the coarse
structure is provided by coarse-level tri-planes, which makes great improvement
in rendering quality for more complex regions. To train the generator, we adopt
an adversarial loss defined on NeRF rendered 2D images to encourage them to be
indistinguishable from the high-quality restored images. We also incorporate a
perceptual loss between the rendered images and the restored images to calculate
structure constraints. Additionally, we propose patch sampling strategies to sta-
bilize the generator training procedure. Once the generator has been trained, we
can generate restored radiance fields with high quality renderings and a certain
level of diversity by sampling different code in the latent space.
We conducted extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of our
method, both qualitatively and quantitatively. The experimental results show-
case the superiority of our approach in various restoration tasks, such as super-
resolution (upper row of Figure 1), camera motion blur (a real-world case at the
right part of the lower row of Figure 1) and the restoration of mixed degradation
consisting of noise, blur, and compression (left part of lower row of Figure 1).
Our method not only generates images with richer and enhanced texture details
but also achieves significant improvements in geometric refinement, as demon-
strated by the mesh visualization in Figure 1. To summarize, our contributions
are:
– We propose a generic radiance fields restoration pipeline that is applicable
to various types of degradation.4 Wu et al.
– We introduce a generative method for NeRF restoration that enables bet-
ter accommodation of geometric and appearance inconsistencies present in
the multi-view images, thus allowing us to incorporate the success of image
restoration into 3D restoration.
– We show the restoration method performs well on various degradation sce-
narios with both enhanced appearance and refined geometry.

2.1 2D image restoration
Image restoration is a long standing problem in low-level vision domain and
significant progress has been achieved in different specific tasks including image
super-resolution,deblur,denoiseandblindrestoration.Previouslyreconstruction-
based methods [11,21,23,51,53] show their success in these tasks. However, those
reconstruction-based method are struggling to generate abundant high-quality
details. Subsequently, generative restoration methods [10,17,25,33,34,38,41,45,
48], particularly those based on diffusion model, have shown the great capability
to render high-quality details. Deepfloyd [34] proposes a super-resolution model,
which concatenates the low-resolution input with random noise at pixel level as
a condition to guide the generation of high-resolution images. For blind restora-
tion, DiffBIR [25] designs a degraded pipeline to simulate real-world degradation
and utilizes thepre-trained diffusion modelto generate photorealistic images.For
camera motion blur, HiDiff [10] recovers exquisite images by using diffusion to
generate feature with abundant detailed information.
2.2 Radiance Fields Restoration
NeRF restoration aims to reconstruct high-quality NeRF given only degraded
images with various artifacts such as blur, noise, or low resolution. Up to now,
several works [2,8,14,19,20,26,30,32,42,43,52] have explored this task under
specific type of degradation. [20,26,43] deal with blurred input images by de-
signing blur kernel or optimizing camera paths for NeRF rendering process. For
NeRF super-resolution, [42] increased the ray sampling density, forcing multiple
rays to render pixels equal to the same pixel, and applied a 2D refinement model
to get final output images. [14] introduces a CEM [1] refinement model to adjust
the output of off-line super-resolution model for better multi-view consistency.
However, the CEM refinement model ruins the structure details of the images
and inconsistencies still exist, leading to a smooth reconstruction result. [30,32]
mainly focus on the noise degradation of the input image. [30] modifies NeRF
to reconstruct the scene in linear HDR color space by supervising directly on
noisy raw input images to address the noise generated during post-processing
from HDR images to LDR images, while [32] achieve NeRF restoration on noisy
images by using noise-awarded encode to aggregate features across views. [52]
considers solving the degradation that occurs in NeRF reconstruction by training
a 2D refinement model using simulated degraded images for typical NeRF-style
artifacts, but they can not achieve refinement on geometry since the restorationRaFE: Generative Radiance Fields Restoration 5
only happens on rendered views. None of the existing approaches can restore
NeRF in 3D space directly with flexible forms of degradation. NVSR [2] archives
3D geometry refine by upsampling tri-plane representation, but their training
processing requires tremendous amounts of 3D data, which are extremely hard
to obtain in practice. By contrast, our method has the ability to handle more
flexible forms of degradation and restore 3D geometry and appearance with the
only needs of an image set for an object or scene, making the 3D restoration
more practical in real-world applications.
3 Method
In this section, we will elaborate the details of RaFE. We introduce how to refine
the degraded views using pretrained 2D restoration model, to capture the high-
quality appearance distribution in Sec. 3.1. Then, we describe our generative
restoration framework including the neural representation, generator architec-
ture and optimization in Sec. 3.2. The training strategy is introduced in Sec. 3.3.
The overall pipeline could be found in Fig. 2.
3.1 High-quality Image Restoration
The recent success on 2D image restoration task is dominated by the denoising
diffusion probabilistic model, benefiting from its powerful appearance generation
capability and prior. Hence in this paper we mainly borrow the recent diffusion-
based restoration methods [25,34] to obtain the high-quality multi-view images
from their low-quality counterparts. It should be noted that our 3D restora-
tion framework could also work pretty well based on non-diffusion restoration
approaches. Please check the experimental parts for more details.
To assist in the restoration of image details, we employ powerful image cap-
tion models [5,22] to get an accurate textual prompt for the scene, denoted as P.
Given a set of multi-view low-quality images I , the textual prompt is produced
l
by selecting a view that contains as much information of the scene as possible,
e.g. a side view of a synthetic Lego model. The prompt P and low-quality im-
ages I are then fed into the restoration model [25,34] to achieve high-quality
l
per-frame refinement. We denote the restored high-quality images as I .
h
The diffusion model-based image restoration methods can effectively recon-
struct high-quality images from various real-world degradation types. Moreover,
thanks to the powerful generalization ability of diffusion models preserved in
these restoration methods, we can handle the scene restoration in open domain
without the needs of re-training. However, though the restored images have bet-
ter quality, more variations among different views occur due to the generative
nature of these restoration models, leading to serious multi-view inconsistencies.
Next, we focus on dealing with this issue with the proposed generative pipeline.
3.2 Generative NeRF Restoration
To deal with geometric and appearance inconsistencies across views, we treat
these restored multi-view images distributed similarly to the rendered images6 Wu et al.

from multiple slightly different high-quality NeRF models. Consequently, instead
of directly fitting a NeRF model using the refined high-quality views which
usually leads to blurry reconstruction, we are trying to learn the distribution of
these diverse NeRF models by leveraging a generative method, allowing us to
sample distinct restored 3D under the same degraded inputs.
3D Representation. Following the recent 3D generative model [6,9,36], we
adopt the hybrid explicit-implicit tri-plane representation for the feature field.
This representation combines both explicit and implicit components to effec-
tively model the density and RGB values. More specifically, to obtain the de-
scriptor for any query location x R3, we project the point onto three planes
∈
(P ,P ,P ) to retrieve the corresponding features (f ,f ,f ) using in-
xy yz zx xy yz zx
terpolation. Then we calculate the mean value of these three sampled features
to obtain the final feature representation.
Once we obtain the features for a point along the ray, we use two MLPs to
decode the density and RGB values. The first MLP, denoted as , maps the
dens
M
features to the density value σ R and a color feature f . The second MLP,
color
∈
denoted as , takes the color feature and the view direction as inputs and
color
M
maps them to the RGB value c R3. We empirically show that incorporating
∈
the view direction allows us to effectively model view-dependent effects, partic-
ularly when there are non-Lambertian surfaces in the scene. After obtaining the
densities and RGB values for each sampled point along the emitted ray, we can
apply the classic volumetric rendering to obtain the color value for each pixel:

NeRF Generator. Given restored multi-view images, we regard them as ren-
derings from several diverse high-quality NeRF models with varied geometry and
appearance. The distribution formed by these distinct NeRF models, formulated
as p (ϕ I ), can be modeled by a generator. With the hybrid explicit-implicit
r h
|
tri-plane representation, we introduce a StyleGAN2 [15]-like CNN-based genera-
tor, which receives a latent code w mapped from random code z to generate fineRaFE: Generative Radiance Fields Restoration 7
tri-planes P for high-quality NeRF rendering. To fully leverage the degraded
f
images and make the generator only focus on generating the necessary refine-
ments, we also pre-train a coarse NeRF model with tri-plane features denoted
as P using the input low-quality images. Specifically, the coarse NeRF model
c
consists of a coarse tri-plane P features and a decoder (where the decoder of
c
coarse tri-planes is shared with the one of fine tri-planes). To obtain the final
refined tri-planes P, we combine the reconstructed tri-plane representations with
the residual tri-planes generated by the generator via: f = f +f . By merging
c f
these components, RaFE effectively captures both the global geometric guid-
ance provided by the coarse NeRF and the local refinements learned from 3D
generator, enabling us to obtain the restored tri-planes that exhibit enhanced
geometric accuracy and appearance fidelity.
Optimization. To supervise the generator and NeRF parameters, we propose
to minimize the distribution discrepancy between the rendered images and the
restored high-quality images. We adopt a saturate GAN [13] loss with an image
level discriminator. Specifically, we treat the high-quality images restored by 2D
model as the real samples while the rendered images as the fake samples, and
utilize adversarial loss with R1 regularization between the real and fake images:
adv = Ez p ,θ p [f(D(G(z,θ))]

[f( D(I h))+λ D(I h) 2],
h ∼ h − ∥∇ ∥
where z,θ represent random code and view point, respectively, and I is the
h
restored high quality image.
However, we observed relying solely on a GAN loss for training can lead
to significant geometric mismatches between the restored images and rendered
views. We argue that although the GAN loss helps align the distribution of
2D renderings, it still lacks geometry-level constraints. Therefore, we also incor-
porate a perceptual loss that encourages the rendered images to resemble the
geometry of pre-frame restoration.

3.3 Patch-based Training Strategy
During the training process, fully rendering the entire image, such as 2562 or
5122 pixels, and then feeding it into the discriminator can be computationally8 Wu et al.
intensive and resource-consuming. This is because volume rendering requires the
computationofdensityandcolorvaluesforsamplingpointsalongtherayforeach
pixel, which can become prohibitively expensive for a whole image. Therefore,
we only render a patch of the view at a time (i.e. 642). The rendered patches
and high-quality image patches are randomly selected, and the discriminator in
Eq. 2 receives patches of rendered images and patches of high-quality images as
fake images and real images respectively. For the perceptual loss in Eq. 3, the
rendered patches and the high-quality patches have the same spacial coordinate
on their original images to guarantee that the cropped patches have the same
semantic and local structure.
One limitation of using patches instead of entire images for training is that
it can be challenging to sample the local scenes evenly at the boundary regions
of images, particularly for forward-facing data. The imbalanced training distri-
bution will result in mode collapse during the training process. To mitigate this
issue, we employ a beta sampling strategy to determine the positions of the
sampled patches. This strategy ensures that patches in the boundary regions of
the image are adequately sampled. More specifically, the beta sampling can be
formulated as:
δ ,δ Beta(β(t),β(t)), (6)
x y
∼
where δ and δ denote the position offset in x and y directions respectively,
x y
while β(t) are linearly annealed from β(0) = 1 to some final value β(T) smaller
than 1. By using the beta sampling strategy, we can maintain a more balanced
distribution of training data that focuses more on the boundary patches, allevi-
ating mode collapse issue and improving the overall training stability.
4 Experiments
4.1 Setup
Datasets.WeevaluateourmodelontheNeRF-Syntheticbenchmarkdataset[30],
which contains 8 synthetic objects with images taken from different viewpoints
uniformly distributed in the hemisphere. Following original setting, We hold 200
viewpoints for generating high-quality training data and 200 viewpoints for test-
ing. Further, to demonstrate the generalization ability of our method, we also
evaluate our method on complex real-world LLFF scenes [29] which consists of
8 scenes captured with roughly forward-facing images. We also demonstrate the
superior performance of RaFE on real-world blur [26] and noise [28] data.
Evaluation Metrics. Following the common practice of 3D reconstruction,
we firstly try to evaluate each method with two standard image quality met-
rics: peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM) [46],
which however could not reflect the real 3D restoration performance according
to our observations. Due to the generative characteristic of RaFE, the recovered
radiance fields from RaFE is very high-quality, but may not faithfully follow the
"ground-truth" 3D, since inversing a degraded signal is a highly ill-posed prob-
lem. Moreover, we also found the baselines with better scores over PSNR and
SSIMstillposethedegradedappearancewithsmoothtexturedetails,asshowninRaFE: Generative Radiance Fields Restoration 9
Figure 3b. Hence, a better way is to leveraging perceptual metric: learned percep-
tual image patch similarity (LPIPS) [49] which computes the mean squared error
(MSE) between normalized features from all layers of a pre-trained VGG [35]
encoder and is deemed to better correlate with human perception. Besides we
also leverage the latest non-reference based image quality assessment metrics
including LIQE [50] and MANIQA [47] to demonstrate the superior rendering
quality of our method.
Implementation Details. We implement all the experiments by PyTorch. For
the 2D generator and discriminator, we use a convolutional-based generator and
discriminator used in StyleGAN2 [16]. In all experiments, we choose Adam op-
timizer for all the modules in our pipeline, with hyperparameters β = 0,β =
1 2
0.99. We use learning rate 2 10 3 for both generator and discriminator. For

experiments. We evaluate RaFE framework on 4 different 3D restoration tasks:
– 4 Super-Resolution: On the blender dataset, we resize the image to 64 64

resolutions to get low-resolution images. As for LLFF data, we first center
crop the training image to 188 252 to adapt to our 4 super-resolution

task and then resize to 47 63 to get low-resolution images. And we use

Deepfloyd [34] for 2D super-resolution.
– Deblur: On the LLFF dataset, we construct camera motion blur by applying
theblurkernelfollowingequationI = A I ,whereAistheblurkernel

and stands for the convolution operator. Different from the blur dataset
∗
proposed in Deblur-NeRF [26], which contains blurred images with varying
degrees ofblur, and even includesa certain amount ofhigh-resolution images,
we apply a large blur kernel size (e.g. 13) and a more complex camera motion
path to all the images in the dataset. We additionally construct consistent
blur datasets by using the same blur kernel to the training image in a scene,
which means the camera motion trajectory is the same for the training image
set. The resolution of images is the same as the super-resolution task. We
use HiDiff [10] to recover high-quality images.
– Denoise: On the LLFF dataset, we follow the noise model used in [27,
32] and we get the noisy version of a clean image I according to equation
I (x) = (I(x),δ2 +δ2I2(x)), where σ is the signal-independent read-
noisy r s r
N
noise parameter, σ is the signal-dependent shot-noise. Following [27,32],
s
we use Gain level to represent the noise strength. We use gain levels = 8 to
get our noisy image. We use DiffBIR [25] to get high-quality images.
– Mixed degradation: The degradation pipeline consists of three stages: blur,
noise, and JPEG compression. First, we utilize Gaussian blur with a
radius of 7 for the blender dataset and 3 for the LLFF dataset. Second, we
add noise with std 25. And then, we apply JPEG compression. The quality
of JPEG compression is 50. The resolution of images is the same as the
super-resolution task. We use DiffBIR [25] to get high-quality images.10 Wu et al.
4.2 Results
Baseline Methods. For general tasks, we try a baseline that firstly restores the
degradedimagesandusestherestoredhigh-qualityimagestoreconstructaNeRF
directly, denoted as NeRF-Perframe. We also use the 2D-based restoration model
SwinIR [24] to do the per-view refinement for the renderings of NeRF trained
by degraded image, denoted as NeRF-SwinIR. Note that we do not evaluate
NeRF-SwinIR for the deblur task since there are no corresponding checkpoints.
To more thoroughly test the effectiveness of our method, we also select some
task-specific competitors. For super-resolution task, we choose NeRF-SR [42],
Neural Volume Super-Resolution (NVSR) [1] as baselines. For mixed degrada-
tion, since there is no existing method tailored for mixed degradation, we choose
NeRFLiX, which tries to solve the NeRF-like degradation by training a 2D re-
finement model using degradation images constructed by a degradation simu-
lator for typical NeRF-style artifacts. We consider this to be the most relevant
method. For the deblur task, we compare with two state-of-the-art methods
Deblur-NeRF [26] and BAD-NeRF [44]. Deblur-NeRF designs a learnable blur
kernel and applys it to rays to simulate the degrading process and BAD-NeRF
directly models the camera trajectories to solve motion blur. For the denoising
task, we compare with NAN [32], which uses a noise-aware encoder to aggregate
the feature of multi-view images for restoration.
Quantitative Results. We conduct extensive quantitative comparisons with
various baselines across different restoration task in Tab. 1a for super-resolution,
Tab. 2b and Tab. 2a for deblurring, Tab. 2c for denoising and Tab. 1b for mixed
degradation. As analyzed before, although most of the time our method falls
slightly behind on the reconstruction metrics like PSNR and SSIM compared
with other baselines, which only measure local pixel-aligned similarity between
the rendered novel views and the ground truth images, are less indicative since
uncertainties naturally exist in generative procedure. Taking the super-resolution
results on Blender data as an example (Tab. 1a), the simplest baseline NeRF-
Perframe have already achieved the best reconstruction metrics, but as shown
in Figure. 3a, its visual quality is vastly inferior compared with our results.
Through the error map, we found the mis-alignment between the generated 3D
and input 3D causes the drop of PSNR and SSIM. By contrast, on the percep-
tual metrics like LPIPS and non-reference based metrics including LIPE and
MANIQA, which could more effectively reflect the restoration performance, our
method consistently achieves better results when compared with other baselines,
demonstrating its clear advantages.
For mixed degradation tasks, the best results for LPIPS metrics are achieved
by NeRFLix w. ref [52]. This is because NeRFLiX can see two high-quality
ground-truth images from the nearest two viewpoints when inference, which
leads to information leakage. However, high-quality ground-truth information is
not accessed in our setting or any real-world cases. After eliminating the impact
of ground truth (NeRFLiX w/o. ref) by replacing the reference ground truth
images with degraded images, our method performs better than NeRFLiX.RaFE: Generative Radiance Fields Restoration 11

Qualitative Results. To further verify the restoration capability, we present
visual results for different degradations in Fig. 4. Our method is able to generate
realistic details while other methods tend to generate smooth results which lack
high-quality details. For example, for the super-resolution task, we show the
drum restoration for each method, as can be seen in Fig. 4, our method generates
high-fidelity drum surfaces with sharp edges, while other methods suffer from
severe blur on the drum surfaces and edges. For mixed degradation tasks, our
method successfully restores the intricate golden textures on the chair surface
while other methods only rendered extremely blurred texture.
Geometry Refinement. Compared with previous NeRF restoration methods,
most of which focusing on using 2D refinement to resolve frame-wise defects,
our method firstly leverages the general priors of large foundation models and
GAN, achieving the open-domain 3D-based restoration. Thus, our restoration
algorithm could not only recover the high-quality and view-consistent images,
but also refine the 3D geometry. We demonstrate this advantage using the Ficus
data of Blender, as shown in Fig. 5a, through comparing the extracted mesh
from the restored NeRF models, our method effectively learns the restoration in
the 3D tri-plane space and recover better geometry.12 Wu et al.

4.3 Real-world Restoration
To validate that our method also works well on the real-world setting, we also
test RaFE using real-noise and real-blur datasets proposed in [28] and [26]. As
shown in Fig. 6a and Fig. 6b, benefiting from the powerful 2D restoration models,
NeRF-Perframe could effectively remove the existing degradations like noise or
blur. Nonetheless, simply averaging the view-inconsistent 2D restored frames
results in very smooth 3D reconstruction. By contrast, through modeling the 3D
space using a generative model, the sampled 3D model from our method could
achieve significantly better rendering quality with realistic and degradation-free
texture details, demonstrating its superiorities on the real-world 3D restoration.
4.4 Discussion
Effects of different restoration models. To investigate the influence of differ-
ent 2D restoration models on our method, we tested two additional off-the-shelf
restoration models for the super-resolution task, including diffusion-based Diff-
BIR [25] and non-diffusion-based SRFormer [53]. As shown in Fig. 5b, diffusion-
based model DiffBIR shows larger restoration diversity over SRFormer as ex-
pected by measuring the diversity score. When the repaired images exhibit di-
versity, direct reconstruction inevitably leads to the blurriness to varying degrees
due to the exisiting multi-view inconsistency. By contrast, through modeling the
distribution of the potential high-quality NeRFs, our method successfully accom-
modates these inconsistencies and consistently achieves better performance over
NeRF-Perframe, demonstrating the great generalization capability of RaFE to
different 2D restoration model.14 Wu et al.

The results show the effectiveness of using the generator to model the distribution.
Effects of the generator. In this ablation study, we examine the influence of
the generator by comparing with the baseline that directly optimizes the NeRF
parameters using GAN loss and LPIPS mentioned above on the Lego dataset.
As we can observe in Fig. 7, the image rendered by generative NeRF exhibits
varied fine-textured details under different random code z. Once the generator
is removed, the rendered images will contain blurry and smooth appearance,
showing the importance of using generator to model the distribution, which can
also be demonstrated by the numerical metrics in the right part of Fig. 7.
Effects of geometry loss & GAN loss. In this experiment, we examine the
influence of geometry and GAN losses on the performance by training the model
on the drums dataset, shown in Fig. 8. We conduct this experiment by setting
the weights of unused losses to 0. As can be seen, removing the geometry loss
results in severe geometry mismatches (e.g. the edges of the drums exhibit distor-
tion), which can be also demonstrated by the drop of PSNR. Meanwhile, using
perceptual loss only makes the rendered image to be very smooth with fewer de-
tails (e.g. the light and reflection), resulting in a significant decline on perceptual
metrics. RaFE trained with both objectives achieves the best performance.

5 Conclusions
This paper proposes a novel generic NeRF restoration method that applies to
various types of degradations, such as low resolution, blurriness, noise, and mixed
degradation. The proposed method leverages the off-the-shelf image restoration
methods to restore the multi-view input images individually. To tackle the ge-
ometric and appearance inconsistencies presented in multi-view images due to
individual restoration, we propose to train a GAN for NeRF generation, where
a two-level tri-plane structure is adopted. The coarse-level tri-plane pre-trained
by low-quality images remains fixed, while the fine-level residual tri-plane to beRaFE: Generative Radiance Fields Restoration 15
added to the coarse level is modeled by a GAN-based generator to capture varia-
tionsinrestoration.Extensiveexperimentsonvariousrestorationtaskswithboth
synthetic and real cases demonstrate the superior performance of our method.
Limitations and Future Work: One limitation of our method is instability
when performing the restoration at extremely high resolutions, such as 4k, due
to the patch-rendering strategy. Moreover, due to the inherent slow efficiency of
NeRF rendering, currently the long training time also needs to be optimized.
To overcome these limitations, a potential solution would be to integrate more
efficient rendering techniques like Gaussian splatting [18] into RaFE, enabling
the rendering of entire images instead of using patches in real-time. We plan to
resolve these issues in the future work.

In this supplementary material, additional training details and more experimen-
tal results are provided, including:
– Training & rendering details of the whole pipeline in Sec. 2.
– Training details of the pre-trained coarse NeRF in Sec. 3.
– More Discussion and experimental results in Sec. 4.

2 Training & Rendering Details
The input images and corresponding viewpoints are randomly selected during
the training process. We also randomly sample random code z from the normal
distribution. And we use a discriminator learning rate of 0.002 and a genera-
tor learning rate of 0.0025. In the early stage of training, we blur the image
to stabilize the training process and reduce the blur kernel size to zero gradu-
ally. Furthermore, we use a density regularization which minimizes the density
differences between adjacent sampled points.
For the NeRF-Synthetic benchmark dataset (Blender), we sample 192 points
for each ray, with 128 stratified sampling points and 48 importance sampling
points. We assume that the blender object is in a [ 1.5,1.5]3 cube and set the
−
near and far plane of the ray to 2 and 6 respectively. For training, we restore 10K
high-quality images randomly selected in 200 training views and we set the batch
size to 32 and the minibatch std group size to 4 for optimizing the generator.
For the forward-facing datasets, we sample 192 points for each ray, with 128
stratifiedsamplingpointsand48importancesamplingpoints.Weusenormalized
device coordinates (NDC) and set the near plane to 0 and the far plane to 1. The
derivation of NDC can be found in NeRF [?]. The size of the dataset, the batch
size, and the minibatch standard deviation group size are the same as those in
the Blender dataset.

3 Details of Pre-trained Coarse NeRF
As mentioned in the main submission, we pre-train a coarse NeRF as the foun-
dation of our residual fine NeRF. In this section, we describe our training details
about coarse NeRF. We use NeRFStudio [?] as our codebase. We re-implement
the hybrid explicit-implicit tri-plane representation within this framework and
use degraded images for training supervision. We minimize the L2 loss, denoted
as L , between the rendered image and the degraded image. Inspired by K-
rec
planes [?], we incorporate additional losses: the TV loss (L ), which minimizes
tv
feature differences between adjacent coordinates on the tri-planes, and the dis-
tortion loss (L ), which pushes the density of a ray within a specific range. The
dis
total loss for optimizing the coarse NeRF is:
= λ L +λ L +λ L , (1)

where λ ,λ and λ denote the trade-off parameters. Specifically, we use

Effects of residual coarse NeRF. In this ablation study, we show that the
residual coarse NeRF could facilitate the model to be aware of the geometry and
help better render highly detailed images, as shown in Fig. 1. We directly drop
the coarse NeRF and train the generator from scratch with GAN loss and LPIPS
loss, forcing the generator to learn the coarse structure and details jointly. We
can observe that with the addition of coarse NeRF, RaFE could better model
the structural information (like the Lego baseplate) and transparent material
(like the drumhead).

let the RGB value directly be decoded by the first MLP jointly with density. As
shown in Fig. 2, objects with non-Lambertian surfaces exhibit significant light
reflections. In contrast, without view direction information, the object in the
figure appears to have no reflections.

Effects of patch sampling strategy. In this experiment, we examine the ef-
fects of our patch-sampling strategy by training the model on the room scene.
To highlight the significance of the Beta sampling strategy, we consider the
case where the value of δ ,δ are sampled from a uniform distribution: δ ,δ

(0,1). This approach essentially obtains image patches through uniform crop-
U
ping, which offers a baseline for comparison. The results are shown in Fig. 3.
As can be seen, the model trained with uniform sampling suffers from unstable
optimization and severe artifacts, which effectively demonstrates the efficacy of
beta sampling in maintaining the rendering quality.

Performance on NeRF-like degradation. In this experiment, we addition-
ally examine our method’s performance on NeRF-like degradation [?] caused by
the reconstruction process of NeRF. We first use high-quality images to train
a NeRF. Although trained sufficiently, artifacts can still be presented in the
images rendered by NeRF models, as discussed in [?]. Then we collect the ren-
dered images as a low-quality set and use our restoration method to recover an
artifact-free NeRF. As can be seen in Fig. 4, Although not specifically tailored4 Wu et al.
for the NeRF-like degradation, our method still demonstrates clearly improved
performance.

5 Details of the diversity score
In this section, we describe the details of the diversity score used to evaluate the
diversity of the generated image set. In particular, we follow the computational
methods described in [?]. We first calculate the minimal LPIPS score for each
image with other images in the image set. Then we average the per-image scores
to get the overall score for the whole image set. The higher diversity score means
the greater diversity of the image set. Here we provide pseudo-code in Algorithm
1 to explain our computational method better.
