Abstract. SNAD is an international project with a primary focus on
detecting astronomical anomalies within large-scale surveys, using ac-
tive learning and other machine learning algorithms. The work carried
out by SNAD not only contributes to the discovery and classification
of various astronomical phenomena but also enhances our understand-
ing and implementation of machine learning techniques within the field
of astrophysics. This paper provides a review of the SNAD project and
summarizestheadvancementsandachievementsmadebytheteamover
several years.

1 Introduction
In modern astronomy, discoveries of new objects are based on a huge flow of
data coming from all-sky surveys (e.g., the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, SDSS [7],
the Zwicky Transient Facility, ZTF [5], the Vera Rubin Observatory Legacy

Survey of Space and Time, LSST [19]). The terabytes of data generated every
night contain information, allowing the discovery of several hundred transients
per year. Undoubtedly, the human resource is limited, and each scientist should
choosefromavarietyofdiscoveredobjectsthosethatareofthegreatestinterest
to him. However, this is not a trivial task, given the number of transients to
choose from. In addition, the total mass of discovered objects may contain rare
ornotyetknownphenomena.Thus,wearefacedwiththeproblemofclassifying
a large number of objects, and specifically in this case: the search for anomalies
or outliers.
It is natural to expect that such large volumes of data that are generated in
astronomytodayrequiremachinelearning(ML)methodsforprocessing.Despite
thefactthatMLhasbecomeanintegralpartofdataanalysisinalmostallareas

of the search for the most interesting objects among all detected ones anomaly
detection (AD) algorithms have a wide field of application: would it be search
forgalaxieswithanomalousspectra[4],transientwithextraordinarylightcurves
[32], or unusual variable stars [27].
However, most of those algorithms are based on statistical models, and the
anomaly is defined as an object that does not fit the model. Observational de-
fectsleadto multipleidentificationsof non-physicalevents asanomalous,giving
theresearcherhundredsofcandidatesforfurtherinvestigations.Todecreasethe
amount of “not interesting” objects and to detect the astrophysical anomalies
ADalgorithmsneedsomeadvisoryfromhumaninwhichobjectshouldbeconsid-
ered as anomalous, i.e., active learning (AL) is required. AL is a subclass of ML
algorithms where the user may adjust the model by interactively setting scores
to the objects which are suspicious for the machine. In this learning paradigm,
the user can select which type of object should be considered as anomalous, ex-
tracting some rare classes of objects from the bulk of huge sky-survey data (see,
e.g., [21,37]).
Given to its important impact in the future of astronomical discoveries with
moderndatasets,theproblemofanomalydetectionhavealreadybeenexplored
in the literature. This includes recent studies using data streams [30], deep [12],
generative [36] and active [22,15] methods. Nevertheless, the incidence of false
positives continues to be an important bottle neck to be overcome if we intend
to take full advantadge of modern astronomical data. We describe here one of
such attempts, which has been consistently focusing on anomaly detection for
astronomy in the last 5 years.
This paper is an overview of the SNAD project – an international group of
researchers (including astronomers, physicists, data scientists and mathemati-
cians) which focus on developing new AL algorithms for the search for anoma-
lous objects in large data-sets of all-sky astronomical surveys. In Section 2 we
provide the description and main goals of the project and the team, and briefly
summarise data sources and used techniques. In Section 3 the most prominent
results of the project are presented. Section 4 describes some auxiliary prod-Exploring the Universe with SNAD: Anomaly Detection in Astronomy 3
ucts developed by the team, which are now publicly available. Section 5 gives
conclusive remarks for future prospects of the project.
2 What is the SNAD project?
2.1 Goals and objectives
The goal of the SNAD9 project is to develop a pipeline where human expertise
and modern machine learning techniques can complement each other in the
task of identifying unusual astronomical objects mostly by their photometrical
features. The team concentrates on the search for unusual, rare or yet unknown
objects in the sets of photometric light curves (LCs) by combining different AL
ADalgorithmswiththeadditionalinformationprovidedbytheexpertinorderto
label a significant fraction of the most obvious outliers and choose those which
are true astronomical anomalies. Enabling reliable anomaly/outlier detection
based solely on photometric observations is one of the fundamental puzzles to
be solved before we can convert the full potential of large-scale surveys into
scientific results. This project represents an effective strategy to guarantee we
shall not overlook exciting new science hidden in the data we fought so hard to
acquire.
2.2 Team members and expertise
The SNAD team is composed of young researchers, each offering a unique set
of skills and experiences that are utilized within the project. All team members
are involved in various stages of the anomaly detection process, from feature
engineering to expert analysis.
In addition to their collective expertise in anomaly detection, each team
member also contributes their unique knowledge from different fields: gamma-
ray bursts (Alina Volnova), supernovae (Maria Pruzhinskaya), fast transients
(AnastasiaLavrukhina),accretionflowsinastrophysics(KonstantinMalanchev),
adapting machine learning algorithms (Emille E. O. Ishida), astronomical site
characterization (Matwey Kornilov), time-domain astronomy and photometric
classification (Partick Aleo), astronomical image analysis and dwarf galaxy de-
tection (Sreevarsha Sreejith), real-bogus classification (Timofey Semenikhin),
aeronauticalscience(VladimirKorolev),symbolicregressionforlightcurveanal-
ysis (Etienne Russeil), observational cosmology (Emmanuel Gangler).
Over the years, several other researchers, including Florian Mondon, Anas-
tasia Malancheva, Alexandra Novinskaya, and Anastasiya Voloshina have also
contributed their skills and knowledge to the project.
SNAD activities are designed around annual meetings whose format was
inspiredbyotherinitiativeswhichfocusedonboostinginnovationandcreativity
(e.g. the silicon valley model [2] and the Cosmostatistics Initiative10 ). We also

field of astronomical anomalies detection. The resulting environment is one of
thekeycomponentswhichplayanimportantroleinthedevelopmentofproducts
described in this work.
2.3 Data sources and techniques
The first data-set used for our research was extracted from the Open Supernova
Catalog12 (OSC; [18]). It contains all publicly available data on all SNe from
a dozen of catalogues, including, in different cases, multi-colour LCs, spectra,
redshift estimations and classification. We extracted 1999 LCs with the number
ofdatapointsenoughtofittheLCwithinsomeparticularintervaloftimerelative
tothemaximum,andpresentedin3differentphotometricpass-bands(gri,g′r′i′
or BRI). These 1999 LCs allowed us to test our main ideas by finding several
peculiar and super-luminous SNe, along with a few dozens of miss-classified
objects [32].
The results of the first try encouraged us to use more numerous data-set of
photometric LCs, and the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) survey results were
chosen. The ZTF survey started on March 2018 and during its initial phase has
observed around a billion objects [5]. Each object is represented with a bunch
of LCs in filters zg,zr,zi with a cadence – on average ∼ 1 day for the Galactic
plane and ∼ 3 days for the Northern-equatorial sky. To minimize the affection
of different cadences on the results we selected 3 different fields: 1 in the M31
galaxy, 1 in the Galactic plane, and 1 far above the Galactic disk and analysed
data from the first 9.4 months of the ZTF survey, between 17 March and 31
December 2018. The total amount of objects with at least 100 data-point in
the LC is 2.25 millions. The results of the search for anomalies in this set are
described in Section 3.
Investigating all data described above we experimented with a series of dif-
ferentanomalydetectionalgorithms.Ourgoalwastoquantifytheireffectiveness

data sets. The successful experiences with AAD motivated many of the results
described below.
3 Key Contributions and Discoveries
3.1 Supernova catalog
The SNAD team discovered potential, unreported supernovae — powerful and
bright explosion of a star, indicating the final stage of its evolution [8] — within
the ZTF DRs during a non-targeted anomaly detection search [27]. This led
to the inception of a new experiment aimed at developing specialized machine
learning models. The AAD algorithm (Section 2.3) and the SNAD Transient
Miner (Section 4.3) have been trained and refined based on our long-term expe-
rience with supernovae. Applying these algorithms, the SNAD team identified
144 new supernova candidates hidden within the vast photometric data of the
ZTF survey.
Each of these candidates has been thoroughly inspected and validated by
our domain experts. Detailed information about the candidates has been made
publicly available in the SNAD supernova catalog13.
Furthermore, these supernova candidates have also been reported to the
TransientNameServer14 (TNS).TheTNSistheofficialresourceforannouncing
new astronomical transients, and our reports ensure that these candidates are
available for further study by the international astronomical community. With
this dual approach of cataloguing and reporting, we aim to foster collaboration
and further our understanding of supernovae.
3.2 Superluminous supernova candidates
Among the supernova candidates discovered using the AAD algorithm (Sec-
tion 2.3) we report four objects: SNAD120, SNAD121, SNAD160, SNAD187,
which could belong to the superluminous supernovae class. They display an un-
usuallybroadLCwhencomparedtotheNugent’smodels15 andmultipleredshift
estimationsindicatetheirhighabsolutebrightness[31].Amongthem,SNAD160
displays a particularly broad LC and further analysis indicates that it could
belong to the pair instability supernovae class [33]. It is a theoretical category
of thermonuclear explosions of extremely massive stars, as described by [3] [16].
There have been no reports of observational confirmation of such event yet and
any good candidate contributes to enrich our understanding of the phenomena.

as two separate datasets. The resulting parametric function describes transient

3.3 Red dwarf flares
WithintheSNADgroup,wearecurrentlyworkingondetectingreddwarfflares
in the high cadence data of the ZTF survey releases. Stellar flares are very en-
ergetic phenomena, during which the optical luminosity of a star increases by
severalfoldovertensofseconds.Thecurrentlyacceptedversionofstellarflares’
nature is a magnetic field, generated in the convective stellar interior [17]. The
detectionofrapidstellarflares,suchasthosefromreddwarfs,isofsignificantim-
portance in the field of exoplanet science, particularly when studying exoplanet
habitability.Additionally,creatingastatisticallysignificant sampleofreddwarf
flares can greatly aid in our understanding of the physical processes involved in
these events.
By this time, approximately a hundred new candidates for red dwarf flares
have been found (A. Voloshina et al., in prep). Some of them were discovered
usingtheAADalgorithm(Section2.3).OthersweredetectedbyfittingtheLCs
with a model that accurately describes the properties and shape of red dwarf
flares’ LCs, followed by further analysis of the goodness of fit. The candidates

3.4 Catalog of artefacts
Another interesting data product that resulted from the construction of the
SNAD database is the SNAD catalog of artefacts. The term artefact is gen-
erally used as an umbrella term to denote observational, phenomenological or8 A. Volnova et al.
instrumental oddities in signal that manifest as diffraction spikes, a step-effect
in brightness, colour saturation etc. to name a few. We are collating a catalog
of such occurrences in the SNAD database that is aimed for both outreach and
science goals. The catalog consists of the OIDs (identifying number that’s ref-
erenced in ZTF), the FITS images of the respective fields and the SNAD link
to the main object page denoted by the OID. Some examples of the artefacts
thus identified are given in Figure 3. While spurious in the strictest sense, sev-
eral of these artefacts present as visually breathtaking making them perfect for
outreach purposes.
The catalog of artefacts also provides a data set for training machine learn-
ing algorithms that could potentially be used for identifying and/or removing
theseobjectsfromfieldsofinterest.Usingthelabelsof2230objectsfromSNAD
knowledge database (Section 4.2), roughly half of which are artefacts, we devel-
oped an algorithm that predicts whether an object is an artefact or not based
on the sequence of object frames from the ZTF survey. The algorithm con-
sists of two parts: (1) a variational auto-encoder that returns the compressed
representationofeachframeafterbeingtrainedonalltheimagesfromthesam-
ple and, (2) a recurrent neural network that takes the sequence of compressed
frame representations and an object label as inputs, and returns the proba-
bility that the object is an artefact. Currently the best classification result is
ROC−AUC=0.856±0.010 and Accuracy=0.802±0.023.

4 Scientific Tools and Resources
4.1 SNAD ZTF Viewer
The SNAD Viewer16 [28] is a web portal specifically designed for astronomers,
providing a centralized view of individual objects from various data releases.
It integrates data from multiple publicly available astronomical archives and
sources,therebyofferingacomprehensiveplatformfortime-domaindataanalysis
and interpretation.

The SNAD Viewer’s infrastructure is characterized by its scalability and
flexibility. It is designed to accommodate a wide range of data types and user
needs,demonstratingitsadaptabilitytothechanginglandscapeofastronomical
research. This adaptability extends to its ability to be personalized and used by
othersurveysandforvariousscientificgoals,underscoringitsbroadapplicability
within the field.
Importantly, the SNAD Viewer is not an isolated entity but is part of a
larger network of astronomical data portals. It is linked to by other significant
portals such as Antares, Fink, YSE PZ, and Astro-COLIBRI, which further
enhances its accessibility and utility within the astronomical community. This
interconnectedness highlights the collaborative nature of modern astronomical
research and the crucial role of the SNAD Viewer within this ecosystem.
The SNAD Viewer is publicly available online, emphasizing its commitment
to open science and the democratization of astronomical data. It serves as a
testament to the crucial roles that domain experts continue to play in the era of
big data in astronomy.
4.2 SNAD knowledge database
In addition to the discovery of candidates in anomalies, our research also led to
thecreationofaknowledgedatabase.OneofthecorefeaturesoftheSNADZTF
Viewer (Section 4.1) is the ability to assign specific tags to each ZTF object,
a function our experts extensively used when reviewing potential anomalies.
This tagging system incorporates a wide range of general astronomical classes,
includingvariablestars,transients,activegalacticnuclei,alongwiththeirvarious
specific types and subtypes. We also devised custom tags for internal purposes,
as well as non-astrophysical tags like artefacts and their subtypes.Multiple tags
can be assigned to a single object, with the history of tag changes stored in the
database.
During the expert analysis, a total of 2743 objects were labelled. Despite

as a reliable source of curated data for training supervised machine learning
models. Furthermore, they can help to refine the ZTF’s pre-processing pipeline,
ensuring more efficient identification and classification of astronomical events in
the future.10 A. Volnova et al.
4.3 SNAD Transient Miner
TheSNADMinerisanexhaustivesimilaritysearchforLCfeaturesfortransient
discovery,usingsimulatedLCsasaguidetoidentifytransientsinalargedataset
mostly comprised of variable stars [11]. Specifically, it leverages extracted sta-
tistical features from simulated SNe LCs, from which a k-D tree is applied to
search for similar feature values in the ZTF DR4. As a result, we discovered 11
previously missed transients, 7 SNe candidates and 4 AGN candidates.
Realistic ZTF simulations were generated using SNANA [24], with ZTF data
release 3 cadence and magnitude error distribution (see [10] for details). Start-
ing from the template models originally developed for PLAsTiCC, [23,20], we
selected the seven brightest, well-sampled LCs to use as a reference (3 SLSN-I,
1 SN Ia, 1 SN II and 2 TDE with peak magnitude ∼17m).
Using these objects, we applied a k-D tree [6] to their extracted 82 non-
normalized features. Subsequently, we identified the 15 nearest neighbors for
eachsimulation(105matchesintotal,resultingin89uniqueZTFDR4sources),
and manually inspected the results. Ultimately, we discovered 11 previously un-
reported supernova and active galactic nucleus candidates. The remaining 94
matches(81uniqueZTFDR4sources)wereeitherknown/alreadyreportedtran-
sients or variable stars. Given the large number of variable stars previously esti-
mated in ZTF data releases [11], it is reasonable to expect many well sampled,
high-amplitude variable stars whose coverage in parameter space significantly
overlaps with the regions populated by transients (see, e.g. Figure 4 in [1]).
Thus, a ratio of 18 transients (11 newly-discovered) to 44 variable stars out of
89 unique sources selected from 990,220 considered ZTF sources is a very suc-
cessful result. Considering the extreme case where ≈ 3000 SNe discovered by
ZTF[14]werepartofthedataset,theexpectedincidenceofSNewhenchoosing
100 sources at random would be of <1(≈0.3) event.
Fig.4: SNAD Miner schematic. We use bright ZTF SNe simulations (left) and
extract their LC features (left center). Then, we apply a (PCA+) k-D tree on
thesefeatures,tosearchforrealZTFDReventsnearestneighbors(rightcenter).
Some of these matched nearest neighbors were previously missed SNe (right).Exploring the Universe with SNAD: Anomaly Detection in Astronomy 11
This “SNAD Miner” process is flexible, and can use simulated or real objects
as the input, any number of features, and any number of nearest neighbors to
“mine” in the existing dataset. A schematic is shown in Figure 4.
4.4 Coniferest Python Library
The coniferest library [35] is aiming to add adaptive capabilities to isolation
forest algorithm which is inherently static.
Thelibraryhasimplementationsoftwoadaptivelearningalgorithms.Oneof
them is an already mentioned earlier AAD algorithm [13]. And the second one
is the implementation of our own adaptive learning isolation forest algorithm
named Pineforest. It is based of tree filtering approach. After every new obser-
vation with some label given by an expert the Pineforest filters out trees that
do not push forward right observations.
This approach have a few remarkable advantages. First, the algorithm have
notmuchhyperparameters,soitiseasytotune.Second,itmaybeusedforboth
– as an adaptive learning with an expert in loop and as an accumulator of prior
knowledge about data. Finally, it has a very good performance characteristics
making it suitable for data intensive applications.
Also, as a bonus the library includes our own implementations of classical
isolation forest with much better performance in scoring compared to scikit-
learn’s one. Refer to coniferest package documentation for more details.
5 Future Directions and Challenges
Largescaleskysurveyshavefundamentallychangedtheprocessofastronomical
investigation and discovery. In the era of LSST, when millions of new transients
will be detected every night, serendipitous discoveries will not happen. On the
otherhand,targetedsearchesareboundtoidentifyobjectswhichfallwithinour
domain knowledge.
TheSNADteamhasbeenconsistentlyworkingonthedevelopmentofadapt-
able algorithms and tools which allow the user to probe the boundaries of their
domain knowledge – thus enabling scientific discovery in large data sets. These
have been proven to be effective in current state of the art catalog data.
In the near future we intend to concentrate our efforts in two important
bottlenecks: ensuring that our tools are scalable to meet LSST requirements
and make additional connections with expert communities to guarantee scien-
tificimpactofSNADproducts.ThelatterwillallowtheSNADteamtodevelop
increasingly more personalized tools which will fulfill the requirements of indi-
vidual experts and ensure that we can fully exploit the scientific potential of
modern astronomical surveys.
