Abstract. Therelevanceofidentificationwithinmediaanditscapacity
to impact the user effectively has been a research focal point for years
whether it is a real or fictional character. Identification in the media
context shapes behavior and broadens the user’s social and emotional
experience. In immersive media (such as video games), virtual entities,
e.g., virtual agents, avatars, or Non-Player Characters (NPCs), bridge
the gap between users and the virtual realm. The sense of immersion
is usually accompanied by a higher degree of identification. When using
visual representations, i.e., in the form of an avatar or agent, new chal-
lenges arise concerning the visual design. In this context, media effects,
especially identification, can again make the interaction more pleasant
and attractive. While in many contexts of use, decisions can be made
regarding visualization using the target group, research in recent years
points to the potential of user-defined design, so-called customization.
Although it seems obvious here that users visualize a virtual image of
themselves in such cases, there are also other approaches to using cus-
tomization.Anessentialquestioninthiscontextiswhetherandtowhat

1 Introduction
Inmediastudies,extensiveresearchspanningdecadeshasfocusedonthecrucial
role of identification and its effective utilization to influence consumers [20, 33].
Whethermanifestedthroughrealorfictionalpersonalities,presentedintext,im-
age, or sound, identification within the media landscape is widely acknowledged
for its transformative impact on behavior, expanding consumer social perspec-
tives, and enriching emotional experiences [20, 35, 39, 41].
Whiletheinfluenceofidentificationintraditionalmediahasbeenextensively
explored, an expanding area of interest lies in immersive media, such as video
games or serious games. On these interactive platforms, consumers assume a
more active role. Virtual characters serve as direct interfaces between users and
the virtual world, with the immersive nature often correlating with heightened
levels of identification [30]. This immersive effect extends beyond entertainment
media to interactive applications in fields like medicine, especially in develop-
ing computer-assisted tools to diagnose, treat, prevent, and rehabilitate mental
illnesses.
Theexplorationofnoveltherapeuticapproachesisparticularlyrelevantgiven
the increasing global prevalence of mental health issues [50]. Computer-assisted
tools present several potential advantages, such as time and cost savings, in-
creased acceptance, accessibility, availability, and reduced barriers for patients
seeking assistance. In this context, virtual avatars and agents act as natural in-
terfaces, representing users or therapists and assuming roles such as assistants,
caregivers, or interview partners [15, 49, 52]. Examples in cognitive behavioral
therapyincludethetext-basedchatbotWoebotstudiedbyFitzpatricketal.[27]
andtheapplicationHelp4MoodbyBurtonetal.[16],featuringa3Dvisualization
of a virtual agent.
Theuseofvisualrepresentations,suchasavatarsoragents,intheseapplica-
tions introduces new challenges in terms of visual design. Media effects, notably
identification, can be intentionally leveraged to enhance interaction, making it
morenatural,pleasant,andappealing.Recentresearchemphasizesthepotentialofuser-defineddesign,commonlycalledcustomization[13,12,57].Whileitmay
seem intuitive for users to visualize a virtual representation of themselves, other
approaches, such as individual creation, have been explored. Avatar therapy by
Leff et al. [45] is an example where patients with schizophrenia give a face to
imaginary voices through a virtual anthropomorphic avatar.
A similar concept was pursued in a recent pilot study targeting mental ill-
nesses like depression and anxiety disorders [40]. Rooted in Beck’s cognitive
therapy [7], patients engage in a dialogue with an avatar to challenge dysfunc-
tional beliefs with alternative, functional thoughts [40]. Although the personal
customization of avatars was initially excluded in this study, discussions of the
results hinted at the potential therapeutic benefits of allowing users to modify
theavatar’sappearance.However,anotherstudybyPimentelandKalyanaraman
[56],exploringthevisualizationofnegativeself-concepts,suggeststhatincreased
identification following personal customization of the avatar could be negatively
influenced when exposed to negative stimuli.
Hence, a pivotal question arises concerning how the degree of identification,
particularly in visualizing negative self-concepts with a virtual avatar or agent,
may impact the user experience of computer-assisted therapy tools addressing
dysfunctionalcognitions[40].Thisquestionservesasthefocalpointofthispaper.
To address the research question on the impact of visual similarity on user
experience in computer-assisted therapy, five hypotheses have been derived to
leverage existing scientific contributions. An experiment incorporating user cus-
tomization features to design virtual agents will then be conducted. The po-
tential effects, particularly those associated with increased identification, were
examinedusingdatacollectioninstrumentsmeasuringemotionalwell-beingand
motivation.
RQ: How does a virtual anthropomorphic agent’s visual similarity or dis-
similarity influence identification and user experience when interacting with a
computer-assisted therapeutic tool addressing dysfunctional beliefs?
H1: The confrontation with a visually self-similar virtual agent has a higher
negative impact on identification than a confrontation with a dissimilar agent.
H2: After confronting a visually self-similar virtual agent, the discrepancy
between positive and negative emotional well-being is significantly higher than
after interacting with a dissimilar agent.

H5: Confronting a visually self-similar virtual agent negatively impacts per-
ceived pressure and tension after customization more than a dissimilar agent.2 Related Work
2.1 On Identification
In psychology, identification encompasses both a defense mechanism and a pro-
cess where individuals adopt traits of significant others, contributing to person-
ality development [44]. It is primarily an unconscious process, although it can
be partially preconscious or conscious (Laughlin, 1979; Schafer, 1973). Drawing
on Freud [28], Wollheim [75], and Bettelheim [9, 10] theories, the identification
process involves temporarily relinquishing one’s identity awareness, allowing a
person to view the world from another’s standpoint [20]. Erikson [26] notes
its development in childhood, intensifying during adolescence with influences
from peers and new authorities. It is part of healthy psychological development,
fostering independence [22]. In social cognitive learning theory, Bandura [2, 3]
emphasizesidentification’sroleinshapingbehavior,influencedbyperceivedsim-
ilarityandmotivatedbyrewards.Notably,identificationisnotlimitedtohumans
and can extend to non-human entities [63]. The consequences of identification,
determined by consciously or unconsciously chosen models, can be positive, fos-
tering self-esteem, self-transcendence, and a sense of meaning and belonging, or
negative and destructive [48].
Twoadditionaltypesofidentification,oftenappliedinthemediacontext,are
similarity identification and wishful identification, shedding light on consumers’
relationships with media characters [20, 33, 41]. Similarity identification, rooted
in Bandura’s insight [2], emphasizes the significance of the perceived similarity
between an individual and a model in predicting the replication of traits. It is
synonymous with ’perceived similarity,’ acknowledging the subjectivity of per-
ceived resemblance rather than an objectively measurable one [2]. In contrast,
wishful identification involves the psychological process where an individual de-
sires or attempts to resemble a model in appearance or behavior [32, 33]. The
distinction lies in whether identification is based on existing, similar traits or
those one wishes to incorporate into one’s identity. Both forms, however, are
closely interconnected, as similarity identification often triggers the desire to
emulate another person or character, especially those perceived as popular or
successful, such as media stars [3, 4].
2.2 Virtual Agents and Avatars
After providing a concise overview of identification and its associated theories,
the focus shifts to defining another pivotal term. Distinguished from a virtual
avatar, a virtual agent, also known as a conversational agent, simulates human
conversations through text or oral language [66]. In a broader context, it is a
userinterfacefacilitatingsysteminteractionswithendusers[64].Thisinteraction
may be based on a predefined script, like a decision tree, or guided by artificial
intelligence [66]. Notable examples include voice assistants like Apple’s Siri, Mi-
crosoft’s Cortana, and chatbots used in customer service on online retailer web-
sites.Virtualagentsfallintotwocategoriesbasedonappearance—thosewithoutvisual representation and embodied conversational agents [17], often portrayed
in two or three dimensions. Depending on the chosen level of detail, embodied
conversational agents can incorporate nonverbal elements like facial expressions
and gestures, enhancing the interaction’s naturalness [47].
Incontrast,avirtualavatar,likeanagent,actsasaninterfacebetweenauser
and a digital application. Particularly in immersive media like video games, the
criticaldistinctionisthatavirtualavataralwaysgraphicallyrepresentsauserin
a virtual space, enabling interaction through controls like a gamepad [29]. They
find applications in video games, social media, and other virtual spaces, repre-
sentingindividualsgraphically[29].Unlikevirtualagents,virtualavatarsalways
represent one or more users, controlled by the user. In immersive applications,
such as video games or serious games, most scientific contributions assume real-
timecontrolofvirtualavatars,incontrasttotheinteractionwithavirtualagent.
This distinction underscores the nuanced dynamics between virtual agents and
avatars, influencing user experiences within digital environments.
2.3 Identification in Immersive Media and Healthcare
Virtual avatars, particularly in immersive contexts like video games, present a
unique case in exploring identification. Unlike traditional media, the active role
of consumers or players fosters a monadic relationship with a media character,
which Kimmt et al. [39] also called “true" identification. This process involves a
convergence of player and player character, leading to the adoption of feelings,
goals, and perspectives [39], which is also theorized to lead to the manifestation
of a distinct self-concept during exposure [8, 24, 39, 70]. This idea is rooted in
Higgins’ Self-Discrepancy Theory [31] and implies that such convergence may
lead to reduced self-discrepancy, especially when aspects of the ideal self of the
player are present in the avatar [8, 39]. Recognizing the effects of identification
in immersive media also extends from Cohen’s work [20, 21]. Positive outcomes
include enhanced media enjoyment [30, 46, 70] and increased persuasiveness of
messages [53, 54]. Moreover, heightened identification positively correlates with
intrinsic motivation, impacting user engagement across various applications like
serious games or self-improvement tools [12, 36, 55].
Another aspect that has been given much attention in recent years is cus-
tomization, which is also said to impact identification positively [12, 13, 70].
Turkay & Kinzer [71] suggest that this is related to Self-Determination The-
ory [62], of which the main components are autonomy, connectedness, presence
or immersion, and intuitive control [61]. User similarity [67], personality traits
[67, 25], time invested [71], and narrative elements [53] also foster identifica-
tion, as well as the overall user motivation to get invested [39]. Understanding
these factors is essential for designing applications that utilize identification for
enhanced user experience and engagement.
While extensive research exists on identification in video games, the appli-
cability of identification effects to digital applications in other domains, partic-
ularly medicine, remains a substantial area for further exploration. Computer-
assisted therapy offers advantages regarding therapist time savings and self-administrationbyindividuals[76,1].Despitedemonstratedeffectivenessintreat-
ing symptoms like depression [19, 27, 58], adherence issues persist, significantly
beyond controlled trials [18, 37]. Addressing this, intrinsic motivation from in-
creased identification, as proposed by Birk et al. [12], could prove beneficial.
However, given variations in interactive elements, such as virtual avatars and
agents, it is crucial to explore user relationships with virtual agents in different
scenarios, as evidenced by existing research on virtual agent perception. Prior
research has explored user perceptions of virtual agents, explored by studies on
Woebot [27], where users anthropomorphized the virtual agent, referring to it
as a "friend" or a "funny little guy". Various studies have also delved into how
the appearance of agents influences user preferences [5, 6, 38], acceptance in
different contexts [11, 51], their role-model potential [60, 6], and the impact of
non-verbalbehavior[43,42].Inthestudy’schosencontextofaddressingdysfunc-
tional cognitions, users confront their negative beliefs through a virtual agent

of confronting oneself to mitigate negative thoughts. Incorporating customiza-

3 Methodology
3.1 Data Collection
Identification with the Virtual Agent (PIS): The identification between
users and the virtual agent was measured using van Looy et al.’s [72] scale for
identificationinonlinegames.Specifically,theavataridentificationsubscalewas
employed, comprising six items each for similarity identification and embodied
presence,andfiveforwishfulidentification.Groupandgameidentificationscales
were excluded. The items were translated into German and slightly adjusted
for contextual relevance, mainly by substituting "avatar" with "agent" while
maintaining the original meaning. All items were rated on a 5-point Likert scale
from 1 = "Strongly disagree" to 5 = "Strongly agree".
Emotional Well-being (PANAS): Given the potential for strong emo-
tional reactions during the engagement with negative thoughts, they were also
recordedusingtheGermanversionofthePositiveandNegativeAffectSchedule
(PANAS) [14], based on the English version by Watson, Clark, and Tellegen
[74] which assesses emotional well-being with 20 items, ten describing positive
affectsandtheothertendescribingnegativeaffectsinadjectives.Allitemswere
rated on a 5-point Likert scale from 1 = "Very slightly or not at all" to 5 =
"Extremely" This questionnaire was chosen because it shows moderate correla-
tions with the negative effect of the Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL), BeckDepression Inventory (BDI), and State Anxiety Scale (STAI) tests, commonly
used for diagnosis in the medical context [74].
Intrinsic Motivation (IMI): To measure intrinsic motivation, particu-
larly linked to enjoyment in identification, the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory
byRyanandDeci[62]wastranslatedintoGermanandapplied.Usingtheinter-
est/enjoyment,pressure/tension,andvalue/usefulnesssubscales,theassessment
delvedintotherelationshipbetweenthesevaluesduringcustomizationandcon-
frontation. Participants rated items on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = "Strongly
disagree" to 7 = "Strongly agree"). This framework [62] has been previously
employed in a similar context [12].
Additional Data: Alongside adapted frameworks, a supplementary ques-
tionnaire was created. Users provided general ratings for the therapeutic tool,
the tested settings, the virtual agent, and the interaction. They evaluated the
utilityofcustomizingthevirtualagentinatherapeuticcontext,expressedsatis-
factionwithavailableoptions,andofferedsuggestions.Ratingswereona7-point
Likert scale, and settings were on a scale from 0 to 10.
3.2 Experiment Setup
Therapy Tool: The therapy tool used in the experiment was built based on
the tool used in the original study [40]. Confrontation with personal dysfunc-
tional cognitions was facilitated through a virtual avatar controlled in real-time
there, while the newly designed tool used a script-based virtual agent. To allow
customization for the two different settings, a 3D model from DAZ 3D Studio
[34], was used. Customization options for the upper body of the virtual agent
included variations in gender, body build, facial features, facial hair, hairstyle,
and eye and skin color. General customization options were selected based on
users’ preferences that emerged from previous scientific contributions [24, 71].
Whendesigningcustomizationoptionsforthetherapytool,emphasiswasplaced
on the virtual agent’s external features rather than its personality traits, given
the assumption that the agent naturally assumes a personality, particularly in
confrontational situations. After preparation, the 3D model was embedded into
theUnitygameengine[69]andusingtheSALSALipSyncSuite[68],audioclips
of negative thoughts, created online with text-to-speech in two variations, were
played in real-time with matching animations. Non-verbal automatic behavior

on dysfunctional attitudes using the Dysfunctional Attitude Scale (DAS-18 A)Fig.1. Customization scene setup.
[59] and self-esteem with the German version of Rosenberg’s Self-Esteem Scale
(RSES) [73].
After completing these questionnaires, participants engaged with the ther-
apy tool. They customized the virtual agent and filled out questionnaires on
identification, positive/negative affect, and intrinsic motivation. Following this,
participants faced confrontation with the agent and, once again, filled out the
same questionnaires presented after customization. They repeated this process
in both, the similarity and dissimilarity settings. In the similarity setting, par-
ticipants aimed to create an agent resembling them, while in the dissimilarity
setting participants aimed to customize an avatar that would not necessarily
look similar to them. The order of settings alternated for each participant. The
entire experiment lasted approximately 45 minutes.

4 Results
4.1 Identification
To confirm that the similarity and the dissimilarity settings significantly differ
regarding the degree of identification, they were compared using a t-test, both
after customization (PRE) and after confrontation (POST). In this section, we
willprovideanoverarchingdescriptionofourt-testanalysisandtheimplications
for our five main hypotheses.
4.2 Hypotheses
H1: The initial hypothesis, pertaining to the extent of impact of the confronta-
tion on overall identification within the contexts of similarity and dissimilarity,
was substantiated through a t-test for dependent samples. In the similarity set-
ting,thevaluesforcomparisonbefore(M=2.54,SD=0.8)andafter(M=2.26,
SD = 0.82) yielded t(21) = 2.23, p = .019, and d = 0.47, signifying statistical
significance with a moderate effect size. Conversely, in the dissimilarity setting
with customization (PRE) (M = 1.38, SD = 0.47) and confrontation (POST)
(M = 1.35, SD = 0.44), the result was t(21) = 0.37, p = .356, and d = 0.08,
indicating neither significance nor a substantial effect size. A closer examina-
tion of the identification subscales unveiled a reduction in wishful identification
within the similarity setting. For customization (PRE) (M = 1.8, SD = 0.82)
and confrontation (POST) (M = 1.5, SD = 0.8), t(21) = 2.54, p = .01, and d
= 0.54 indicated the overall strongest reduction across all subscales. Similarly,
similarity identification also decreased significantly from customization (PRE)
(M = 3.29, SD = 0.92) to confrontation (POST) (M = 3.05, SD = 1.09) with
t(21) = 1.33, p = .034, and d = 0.41. In contrast, the overall smallest effect
was observed for the embodied presence subscale in both settings. Upon direct
comparison in terms of identification subscales, significant differences for each
one were noted for customization (PRE) and confrontation (POST), except for
wishful identification after the confrontation with the virtual agent (Figure 2).
H2: As anticipated, the higher discrepancy between positive and negative
affect in the similarity setting after the confrontation was confirmed to be over-
allhighercomparedtothedissimilaritysetting.Tovalidatethisobservation,the
disparities between positive (M = 29.46, SD = 7.25) and negative affect (M =
17.86, SD = 8.1) in the similarity setting (POST) were contrasted with posi-
tive (M = 26.64, SD = 6.0) and negative affect (M = 17.77, SD = 6.61) in the
dissimilarity setting (POST) was calculated. The t-test examining these differ-
ences resulted in t(21) = 3.02, p = .003, and d = 0.67, indicating a statistically
significant distinction (Figure 3).
Uponcloserexamination,itwasobservedthatasimilardifferencewasfound
for customization (POST). The similarity setting (PRE) displayed a contrast inFig.2. Identification with Virtual Agent after Customization (PRE) and after Con-
frontation (POST).
differences between positive (M = 29.45, SD = 6.0) and negative affect (M =
14.96, SD = 5.69) when compared to the dissimilarity setting (PRE) with posi-
tive (M = 25.41, SD = 6.48) and negative affect (M = 16.23, SD = 7.53). The
t-test resulted in t(21) = 1.88, p = .037, and d = 0.4. It is noteworthy that pos-
itive affect in both settings is overall higher for the similarity setting, although
onlymarginallysignificant.Anotherimportantfindingisthatthesimilarityset-
ting exhibited a significant increase in negative affect from customization to
confrontation. The comparison between customization (PRE) (M = 14.96, SD
= 5.69) and after confrontation (POST) (M = 17.86, SD = 8.1) yielded t(21) =
-1.82, p = .041, and d = 0.39.
H3:Forthishypothesis,thenegativeimpactoftheconfrontationoninterest
andenjoymentisnotablymorepronouncedinthedissimilaritysettingcompared
to the similarity setting, as corroborated in the following outcomes. In the simi-
laritysetting,thecomparisonofcollecteddataforinterestandenjoymentfollow-
ing customization (PRE) (M = 5.14, SD = 0.85) and confrontation (POST) (M
= 4.73, SD = 1.1) yielded a t(21) = 1.91, p = .035, and d = 0.41. Conversely,
in the dissimilarity setting, the comparison after customization (PRE) (M =
4.94, SD = 1.12) and confrontation (POST) (M = 4.42, SD = 1.03) resulted
in t(21) = 2.28, p = .017, and d = 0.5. Therefore, statistical significance was
observed in both settings in the before-after analysis, with the overall impact
being higher in the case of the dissimilarity setting. Furthermore, no notable
differences were observed when directly comparing the two settings before and
after the confrontation.
H4:Thesubsequenthypothesisaddressestheperceivedvalueandusefulness
of the confrontation, with the initial assumption that these factors would be
significantly higher for the similarity setting (POST) (M = 4.41, SD = 1.58)Fig.3. Positive and Negative Affect during Customization (PRE) and Confrontation
(POST).
compared to the dissimilarity setting (POST) (M = 4.22, SD = 1.5). However,
the calculation following the confrontation yielded values of t(21) = 0.84, p =
.206, and d = 0.18, indicating a lack of statistical significance. Consequently,
the hypothesis is falsified. Upon closer examination of the collected data, the
similaritysettingexhibitedanoteworthyincreasewhencomparingcustomization
(PRE) (M = 4.02, SD = 1.68) and confrontation (POST) (M = 4.41, SD =
1.58), resulting in t(21) = -1.95, p = .032, and d = 0.42, signifying statistical
significance. In contrast, the dissimilarity setting did not yield similar results.
Here as well, the direct comparison between the settings for both phases of the
experiment shows no significant differences.
H5: Finally, the last hypothesis suggests that the perceived pressure and
tension of each participant would increase to a greater extent in the dissimilar-
ity setting, compared to the similarity one. This was verified using a t-test. In
the similarity setting, after customization (PRE) (M = 2.54, SD = 1.35) and
confrontation (POST) (M = 3.41, SD = 1.7), the values were t(21) = -2.92, p
= .004, and d = 0.62. Conversely, for a dissimilar virtual agent, the comparison
betweencustomization(PRE)(M=2.36,SD=1.12)andconfrontation(POST)
(M = 3.4, SD = 1.52) resulted in t(21) = -3.6, p < .001, and d = 0.77. Thus,
the change is significant in both cases, but the effect is more pronounced in the
dissimilarity setting, thereby verifying the hypothesis (Figure 4).
5 Discussion
5.1 Identification, Similarity, and Dissimilarity
The results from the previous section suggest that confrontation, especially in
thesimilaritysetting,negativelyaffectsidentification.Notably,engagementwithFig.4.IntrinsicMotivationsubscaleratingsforinteractionwithVirtualAgentforboth
settings.
the virtual agent in a confrontation led to a general decrease in identification,
potentially impacting positive effects like interest and enjoyment. However, this
reduced identification could be desirable, aligning with the relevance of distanc-
ing oneself from negative beliefs.
Also, in the similarity setting, similarity identification was significantly re-
duced. Surprisingly, this was not the case for the dissimilarity setting, in which
it showed a slight increase. Although not significant, this raises questions about
userssuddenlyperceivingthevirtualagentassimilar.Givenminimaldifferences
and the possibility of reporting errors, these cases leave open questions. Unex-
pectedly, high presence scores challenged the assumption that virtual agents’
reduced interactivity would negatively impact presence.
Overall. presence, along with similarity and wishful Identification, decreased
post-confrontation,underliningthepositivecorrelationsamongthesubscales,as
also mentioned in prior research[33, 72].
5.2 Positive and Negative Affect
Our second hypothesis suggested a greater difference between positive and neg-
ative affect would occur post-confrontation in the similarity setting compared
to the dissimilarity setting. The results supported this hypothesis, showing that
designing oneself might have been perceived as more satisfying than creating an
arbitrary person. Although not conclusively proven in this study, it is reason-
abletoassumethatself-designledtolowerdiscrepanciesandlikelymorepositive
feelings, as mentioned before. In the dissimilarity setting, users often deviated
fromtheirgenderorchoseamusingoptions.Thus,thedissimilaragentwaslikely
distant from most users’ self-concepts, possibly allowing more discomfort post-
customization compared to the similarity setting.Significantly, negative affect increased post-confrontation in the similarity
setting, while positive affect remained unchanged on average. While an increase
in negative affect when confronted with unpleasant thoughts is understandable,
a similar significant increase in positive affect could have also been expected if
users successfully coped with the confrontation. Despite non-significant trends
in positive affect increase in the dissimilarity setting, the overall higher mean
values in the similarity setting suggest that confronting a self-similar agent was
perceived as more unpleasant. Consideration of these findings, however, should
be relative to dissimilarity setting values, which were inherently higher.
5.3 Intrinsic Motivation
Although no significant differences in customization were observed, the dissim-
ilarity setting’s confrontation significantly decreased interest and enjoyment,
aligning with the hypothesis these. A similar significant decrease was found
in the similarity setting, where interest and enjoyment were higher on aver-
age. However, no significant differences emerged when comparing customization
and confrontation values for similarity and dissimilarity. The subsequent hy-
pothesis addressed the perceived value and usefulness of confronting the virtual
agent,suggestingthatthesimilaritysettingpost-confrontationcouldpotentially
be perceived as more valuable. However, the data contradicted this hypothesis,
indicating that both settings confrontation was perceived as useful, possibly be-
cause only the core exercise of contradicting the agent was considered. Lastly,
tension and pressure during interaction were considered, with anticipation of a
stronger increase in the dissimilarity setting. Although pressure increased sig-
nificantly for both settings, it was stronger in the dissimilarity setting, aligning
withtheobservedincreaseinnegativeaffect.Itisthereforereasonabletoassume
that confrontation does amplify negative feelings.
5.4 Evaluation of the Therapeutic Tool
Following the implementation of the therapeutic tool, supplementary data were
gathered to rate the tool, the virtual agent, and the interaction with it. The
tool garnered a positive reception overall, with a noticeable inclination towards
the similarity setting. Participants expressed a preference for this setting, as-
signing significantly higher ratings compared to the dissimilarity setting. The
general rating of the interaction with the virtual agent was positive, although
evaluations of visual, auditory, and non-verbal behaviors received slightly lower
ratings.Theincorporationofacustomizationfeatureforthevirtualagentwithin
the framework of addressing dysfunctional cognitions was well-evaluated.
5.5 Limitations
In the course of the experiment, several limitations emerged that warrant con-
siderationforthebroaderapplicationoftheresults.Similarly,thestudyencoun-
ters challenges in establishing correlations between identification and outcomes.Although moderate correlations were discerned in the similarity setting, other
significant dependencies remained either unattainable or only partially demon-
strated.Apropositionismadeforamorestringentdelimitationofvariablesand
a larger sample size to potentially reveal explicit relations.
Moreover, the study’s consideration of only external attributes for identi-
fication, owing to financial and temporal constraints, resulted in limited cus-
tomization options. Participant feedback indicated a desire for a broader array
ofoptionsencompassinghairstyles,facialtextures,voices,andevenfeatureslike
age and height. While the available options were generally rated as sufficient,
the absence of certain options might negatively impact user satisfaction. Ad-
ditionally, the study’s one-week timeframe introduces a potential limitation in
understanding shifts in identification levels over an extended period. Prolonged
use may exert an influence on observed effects, and the procedural aspects of
customizationduringextendeduseposeopenquestions.Asuggestionwasmade
toallowuserstheopportunitytomodifythevirtualagentovermultiplesessions,
considering the dynamic processes influencing self-perception. Temporary fluc-
tuations in self-perception may occur due to factors such as mood or priming
effects[65,23].Thisapproachalignswiththepotentialforshiftsinidentification
levels over an extended timeframe, as noted in the literature [39, 71].
6 Conclusion
This study explored the impact of virtual agent similarity on user identification
and the user experience in a therapy tool for treating dysfunctional cognition.
Customization of self-similar and dissimilar agents was followed by a confronta-
tion phase. Results indicate higher identification with self-similar agents, es-
pecially in the similarity setting. Confrontation negatively affects identification,
particularlyinthesimilaritysetting,withasignificantreductioninwishfuliden-
tification.
Emotional experiences vary based on agent similarity, with self-similar set-
tings correlating with higher positive affect and dissimilar settings displaying
highernegativeaffect.Intrinsicmotivationshowsfluctuationspost-confrontation,
with increased interest during customization but a significant decrease in both
settings. Perceived value and usefulness increase post-confrontation, notably in
the similarity setting. Elevated pressure and tension post-confrontation, also
supportedbyincreasednegativeaffect,aremorepronouncedinthedissimilarity
setting.
The study suggests potential links between identification and other factors.
The visual appearance of a self-similar or dissimilar virtual agent significantly
impacts emotional well-being and motivation, potentially influencing therapy
success.Identification,especiallywhensupplementedbycustomization,mayen-
hance motivation for prolonged interaction. The study provides insights into
customization, virtual agent identification, and their implications in therapy.
