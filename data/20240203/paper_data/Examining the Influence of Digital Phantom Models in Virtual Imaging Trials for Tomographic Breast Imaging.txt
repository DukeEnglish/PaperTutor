Purpose: Digital phantoms are one of the key components of virtual imaging trials (VITs)
that aims to assess and optimize new medical imaging systems and algorithms. However, these
phantoms vary in their voxel resolution, appearance and structural details. This study aims to
examine whether and how variations between digital phantoms influence system optimization with
digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) as a chosen modality.
Methods: We selected widely used and open access digital breast phantoms generated with dif-
ferent methods. For each phantom type, we created an ensemble of DBT images to test acquisition
strategies. Human observer localization ROC (LROC) was used to assess observer performance
studies for each case. Noise power spectrum (NPS) was estimated to compare the phantom struc-
tural components. Further, we computed several gaze metrics to quantify the gaze pattern when
viewing images generated from different phantom types.
Results: Our LROC results show that the arc samplings for peak performance were approxi-
mately 2.5◦ and 6◦ in Bakic and XCAT breast phantoms respectively for 3-mm lesion detection
task and indicate that system optimization outcomes from VITs can vary with phantom types
and structural frequency components. Additionally, a significant correlation (p¡0.01) between gaze
metrics and diagnostic performance suggests that gaze analysis can be used to understand and
evaluate task difficulty in VITs.
Conclusion: Our results point to the critical need to evaluate realism in digital phantoms as
well as ensuring sufficient structural variations at spatial frequencies relevant to the signal size for
an intended task. In addition, standardizing phantom generation and validation tools might aid in
lower discrepancies among independently conducted VITs for system or algorithmic optimizations.

2I. INTRODUCTION
Rapid advances in medical imaging technologies and methods make it impossible to eval-
uate and optimize several emerging and competing systems and algorithms using clinical
imaging trials. These trials can take extensive resources and long duration. Virtual imaging
trials (VITs) are alternative approach to assess the potential of an imaging system, software
or specific system/software combinations.[1–8] VITs are based on in-silico methods, where
digital phantoms replace patients, software platform mimics imaging process, and virtual
interpreters represent the human readers.
As VITs are becoming more accurate, realistic digital phantom development has drawn
much attention from the medical imaging community. Our group recently examined the
contributionofanatomicalandquantumnoiseinsignaldetectionandperformanceforhuman
observers in such imaging trials [9, 10]. Using VITs, we have also examined in the past,
the development of novel visual search observer models to match humans [11–13], system
and algorithm optimization questions [3, 4, 14–17], understanding image texture features as
relevant to human observer performance [18, 19], and radiomics variability [20]. As in other
group’s work, all of these studies were conducted with one breast phantom type.
Here we will evaluate what implications a VIT study outcome may have by changing the
phantom type. We once again take DBT as the modality of choice to examine this critical
question and use two widely accepted types of breast phantoms - both considered anthro-
pomorphic. For the last few years, many computational breast phantoms have been devel-
oped using different methods.[21] Some commonly used breast phantoms include power-law
based phantoms[22–25], anthropomorphic phantoms[26–31], modified patient tomographic
data[32–36], and mastectomy specimens[37–39]. These phantoms vary in their resolution,
model, structures, and details. Power spectrum analysis has been used as a method to
assess phantom structures and realism. [27–30, 38, 40, 41] Cockmartin et al [41] observed
in 2013 that none of the evaluated phantoms matched with the patient data in terms of
power-spectrum parameters. Few studies extended the realism assessment with trained hu-
man’s (physicists and radiologists) rating. [27, 30, 32, 34] Badano[42], however, argued that
realism is subjective and simulating relevant properties for the task is sufficient. But it is
3unclear which properties are relevant and what level of realism is sufficient for the task of
tomographic imaging system/algorithmic optimizations.
Past work by various groups have used different phantom types for evaluating DBT sys-
tem configurations[22, 37, 43, 44]. Because of the differences in phantoms, configurations,
and interpreters among the studies, there is little agreement on the optimal configuration.
Specifically,thecontributionofphantomdifferencesintheseinconsistenciesisnotwellunder-
stood. In preliminary analysis, Park et al. [45] and Zhao et al [46] observed that phantom
differences (uniform vs structured) influence tomographic system optimal configurations.
However, differences resulting from various available structured phantoms (when they are
each considered realistic by the research community) has never been explored.
We explore this critical question and examine whether and how phantom structure vari-
ability would influence the study outcome of a VIT such as for DBT acquisition parameters.
Inaddition, wealsoinvestigatedtheinfluenceoftaskdifficultyduetochangeinthephantom
structures using analysis of observer gaze pattern and interpretation process when viewing
images generated with different phantoms in the VIT studies. We present results from our
study examining the influence of breast phantom types in VIT for DBT when all other
aspects remain the same. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first study to evaluate
this critical aspect.
To accomplish this, we selected two widely used and open access breast phantom types
which were generated using different procedures. Further, human observers analyzed simu-
lated in-plane DBT images of the selected phantoms for similar configurations. Our results

II. MATERIALS AND METHODS
The study methods are summarized below. First, the selected phantoms are listed. Sec-
ond, our simulation methodology is described to generate both abnormal and normal cases
of DBT images. Next, the experimental method to estimate human observer performance
and gaze pattern is discussed. Finally, the procedure to characterize phantom structures
4using a power spectrum is described.
A. Phantom Selection
We selected two types of digital breast phantoms for this study: three-dimensional an-
thropomorphic breast models generated by Bakic et al. at the university of Pennsylvania
[26] (hereafter referred to as Bakic phantom) and XCAT breast phantoms generated at Duke
university using compressed volumes of patient breast CT data [33] (hereafter referred to as
XCAT breast phantoms). Bakic phantoms are based on mathematical models which define
the breast structural variability. These phantoms can be manipulated easily through the
model configurations to simulate changes in anatomy. XCAT breast phantoms are based on
patient breast CT images. These phantoms may appear more realistic, but changing their
anatomical variations or resolution is difficult [7]. For our analysis, six digital phantoms of
5-cm thickness for each type were selected. The phantoms of each type were categorized
based on volumetric glandular fractions (VGFs) with 25% density and other three with
50% density. Bakic and XCAT breast phantoms have a voxel resolution of (0.2mm)3 and
(0.25mm)3 respectively. The selected case numbers of XCAT phantoms of approximately
25% density are CTA1608, CTA0357, and CTA1326 and of approximately 50% density are
CTB6013, CTA1284, and CTA1285.
Figure 1 shows sample slices of both types of phantoms on the top. The transitions in
XCAT breast phantoms from 100% glandular to adipose tissue have intermediately dense
(25%,50%, and 75%) voxels while these transitions are sharp (100% dense to adipose) in
Bakic phantoms. The XCAT breast phantoms lack small structures such as cooper‘s liga-
ments. Erickson et al. [33] noted that the ”lack of very fine-detail structures like cooper‘s
ligaments can negatively impact the realism of digital phantoms”. References [34, 35, 47]
tried different methods to improve XCAT breast phantoms, but these phantoms were not
released publicly.

B. Image Generation
The DBT images used in this study were generated using a simulation platform based
on serial cascade model[48, 49]. The simulation platform modeled generic DBT systems
with both source and detector rotating geometry, which was detailed in our previous work
[9, 49, 50] and is described briefly here. The x-ray spectrum modeled a 30-kVp molybdenum
anode source with 0.7-mm thick Al filter and the x-ray fluence scaled to provide a 1.5
mGy mean glandular dose (MGD) to a 5-cm-thick compressed breast. This total dose
6was evenly distributed at each projection angle and the x-ray fluence per projection was
determined based on the breast dosimetry data (Dgn coefficients) generated by a Monte
Carlo simulator[51]. Focal-spot blurring with a 0.1-mm focal-spot size was modeled using
a Gaussian modulation transfer function. The detector was modeled as a 0.1-mm thick
CsI based a:Si flat panel detector with a 0.1-mm pixel size. The scintillator blurring was
modeled using an empirically measured pre-sampling MTF. Quantum noise was modeled
by a Poisson distribution for each keV (at the absorption of x-rays with in the scintillator),
while additive electronic noise followed a Gaussian process with a standard deviation of 2200
electrons. Scatter was not modeled in this simulation.
The lesion targets were homogeneous spherical masses with a 3-mm diameter. While this
is smaller than the average lesion sizes detected by the current DBT systems, VITs are also
aimed at evaluating future imaging system designs. This signal size of 3-mm was also chosen
toachievesufficienttask-challengewithoutrequiringtoartificiallyalterattenuationvaluesof
the signal and to the capture the human observer performance trends more accurately for a

locations as absolute performance was not relevant for this study. The simulated mass was
assumed to have an energy-dependent attenuation coefficient for invasive ductal carcinoma
as reported by Johns and Yaffe.[52] Eight abnormal cases and one normal case were formed
for each phantom. The projections were acquired using Siddon’s ray tracing method [53]
to model x-ray transmission through the breast. Two different sets of projections were
generated with different phantom types. In order to filter the random noise, an adaptive
Wienerfilterbaseddenoisingalgorithmwasappliedoneachprojection.[54,55]Thedenoising
algorithm was shown to reduce the noise effectively in our prior work [9]. Each data set was
acquired over an angular span of 60◦ with projection number P ∈{3, 7, 11, 15, 19, 21, 25, 31,
35, 41, 45} by keeping the total dose steady at 1.5 mGy for each DBT acquisition. Feldkamp
filtered back-projection (FBP) algorithm[56] was used for image reconstruction. A three-
dimensional Butterworth filter with a cutoff of frequency 0.25 cycles/pixel was applied on
reconstructed volumes. In-plane DBT images of 1-mm thickness were produced by applying
7aboxcaraveraging. Eightlesion-present(abnormal)andeightlesion-absent(normal)images
were created for each phantom for the human observer studies as described in our earlier
work[4]. A set of 96 images were produced from the six phantoms of each phantom type
for a given projection number. Figure 1 shows sample 1-mm abnormal DBT slices of both
types of phantoms on the bottom.
C. Human Observer Study
Three non-radiologists took part in the Localization ROC (LROC) experiments. An
LROC study entails both detection and localization of a 3-mm spherical lesion. The task
in our study is search and localization/detection of spherical mass in simulated in-plane
DBT images thus justifying the non-radiologists as observers. Physicists and engineers who
participated as observers had the same level of experience in reading simulated images.
The human observer experimental method was same as that described in our prior work
[3, 4, 11, 12] and summarized briefly here. In this study, in-plane DBT slices of the Bakic
phantom set correspond to five acquisition protocols with projections of 7, 11, 19, 25 and 35
and XCAT breast phantom set correspond to six acquisition protocols with projections of
3, 7, 11, 19, 25 and 35 were evaluated. The 96 images per set (48 pairs of abnormal/normal
images) were divided into 72 test images (36 pairs) and 24 training images (12 pairs). All
sets included an initial training session followed by a test session. Each observer thus read 10
image sets. Observers were asked to select the lesion location, and a four-point ordinal scale
was used to collect the confidence rating. Localizations were considered as correct when
the observer selected the location within a 2-mm radius of lesion center (radius of spherical
lesion+0.5mmadditionalradiusforhumanselectionerror). Theobserversperformancewas
quantified with area under LROC curves (AUC). The estimate of AUC for a given observer
and protocol was obtained with a Wilcoxon-based non-parametric ranking method. In order
to assess the consistency of the AUC values between the observers, the intraclass correlation
coefficient (ICC) was calculated using Python (v3.7.6) software (www.python.org).
8D. Eye Gaze Collection
Numerous studies have demonstrated that gaze metrics correlate with diagnostic perfor-
mance and can reveal human observers interpretation process[57–60]. In order to evaluate
the differences in the interpretation process due to the change of phantom type, we collected
gaze data using a screen based eye-tracking system (Tobii pro X3-120 with EPU ). An ad-
ditional three more non-radiologists participated for the eye tracking study. The eye gaze
data was collected for a single acquisition protocol of 35 projections for both type of phan-
toms. Both presentation of stimuli and eye-tracking were controlled by a Lenovo thinkpad
p52s laptop using an in-house built Python software. A calibration and validation proce-
dures were performed before starting a session. The images were displayed on a standard
Dell 23.8 inch LCD monitor with a resolution of 1920 × 1080. Once the software collects
and stores the gaze logs, post processing was applied to estimate fixation locations, fixation
durations, and saccade durations using an I-VT filter based on Tobii pro white paper[61].
Figure 2 shows a sample gaze pattern of an observer for the task of searching and locating
a 3-mm lesion. Each vertex indicates the fixation center with numbers indicating fixation
order and lines indicating the saccade paths and lengths.
FIG. 2. Example gaze pattern with fixations and saccades on DBT slices of 25% dense (top) and
50% dense (bottom) phantoms.
9We computed five gaze metrics to characterize the gaze pattern. Namely, we found total
time spent on each image, total number of fixations made on each image, time taken to first
fixate on the lesion region (first hit time), number of fixations on lesion region, and accu-
mulated lesion dwell time. These gaze metrics were estimated using MATLAB2018a (The
MathWorks, Inc.) with in-house built scripts. Spearman rank correlation was estimated
between the average values of each gaze metric and the corresponding AUC values of the
six observers.
E. Noise Power Spectrum (NPS)
Noise power spectrum (NPS) based analysis has been used in literature to quantify the
similarity between phantom structures and clinical data.[28, 41]. Our NPS estimation meth-
odsarebrieflysummarizedhereandcanbefoundindetailelsewhere[9]. Weselectedmultiple
regions of interest (ROIs) of size 2.43cm×2.43cm from each lesion-absent DBT slice from
the breast region. The mean of each ROI was subtracted from the corresponding ROI and a
Hann tapering window was applied to each ROI to reduce the edge artifacts. The 2D NPS
was calculated by ensemble averaging the square of the magnitude of the discrete Fourier
transform of each tapered ROI , and radial averaging of the 2D NPS was performed, result-
ing in a 1D NPS. A linear regression fit (from lower frequency ranges between 0.1 and 0.15
mm−1 to higher frequency ranges between 0.4 and 0.7 mm−1) was estimated to the natural
logarithm of the 1D NPS that maximizes the coefficient of determination (R2). The NPS
parameter β is estimated as the slope of linear fit.
III. RESULTS
A. Human Observer LROC Results
In our studies, each human observer was tasked with search and localization of a 3-mm
lesion within the displayed DBT image slice (similar to the ones shown in fig 1). Figure
3 shows sample regions of DBT slices with lesion at the center of region to illustrate the
changes in the visibility of the signal for varying number of projections in both types of
10phantom backgrounds. The signal is better visible in Bakic phantom background for the
acquisition configuration of 35 projections, whereas the signal is better visible in XCAT
breast background for the acquisitions of 11 to 35 projections. Figure 4 presents LROC
plots for the three observers, for a sample acquisition of 35 projections over 60◦ arc span,
in both phantom backgrounds. The y-axis of the LROC represents the joint probability of
correctly localizing a lesion in a case reported as positive. Therefore, the curve reaches up
to the percentage of cases with correct lesion localization. The LROC AUC values above
zero are considered as better than guessing as the likelihood of guessing the lesion’s location
is zero. Figure 5 shows the average performance of the three observers in both Bakic and
XCAT breast phantom images. Error bar lengths indicate twice the standard error of the
three observers’ AUC values. We observed a greater improvement in performance up to
11 projections in XCAT breast phantom backgrounds and a steady performance thereafter.
This corresponds to an arc sampling of approximately 6◦ between adjacent projections for
peak performance. In Bakic phantom backgrounds, observers’ performance improved up
to 25 projections and required finer arc sampling of approximately 2.5◦ to achieve peak
performance. We also plotted the detection performance separately for 25% dense and 50%
dense slices, where 25% dense indicates easy level of task difficulty while 50% dense indicates
higher level of task difficulty. Regardless of phantom type, both levels of task difficulty show
similar trends and suggest that optimization may not change with the task difficulty, which
is in accordance with earlier observations by Zeng et al. [44] and Mackenzie et al.[62]. We
also noticed in figures 4 and 5 that observers had overall slightly lower performance in XCAT
breast backgrounds than in Bakic backgrounds in particular for 25% dense images. This
difference can not be attributed to phantom structures necessarily as the local densities in
the region where lesions are inserted could also influence these LROC AUC. The magnitude
of AUC values are less relevant in this particular study as only relative change in AUC
values with changing system parameters (such a number of projection in this study) were
used to deduce the final conclusions. The inter-observer agreement, quantified using the
ICC, ranged from 0.92 to 0.95 with the average AUC values, suggesting a strong agreement
between the observers.

number of projections.
B. Power Spectrum Analysis
In order to characterize the structural variations of the selected phantom types, we esti-
mated the NPS of the simulated DBT images. We selected the NPS of in-plane DBT images
corresponding to the acquisition configurations of 35 projections over a 60◦ arc span for com-
paring the phantoms’ structures. Figure 6 shows the averaged NPS of both the phantom
types in log-log scale along with linear fits. These plots show that Bakic phantom back-
grounds have higher spectral densities at higher frequencies (considered as the anatomical
region) than that of XCAT breast phantom backgrounds. We note that this high anatomic
noise is not reflected in the calculated β values. The estimated values of β were 2.52 and 3.32
respectively for Bakic and XCAT breast phantom backgrounds. This result is contradictory
to popular belief that lower β values indicate lower anatomical noise and in agreement with
observations made in our prior work[9].

C. Gaze Analysis
From the eye-tracking data, the total time spent as well as the total number of fixations
made on images (both lesion present and lesion absent images) were estimated. For lesion
present images, we also estimated the first hit time (on the lesion), lesion dwell time and

the number of fixations on lesion. Each of these gaze metric was averaged across all images
for a given phantom type and breast density for each observer. Figure 7 shows the influence
of phantom type on two of the gaze metrics plotted separately for lesion absent and lesion
present images. Observers spent longer time and made more fixations to diagnose lesion
absent images than lesion present images, which is in-line with previous findings [63, 64].
The most striking result to emerge from this data is that observers spent longer time and
14FIG. 6. The power spectra analysis of DBT slices of both type of backgrounds for a sample
acquisition protocol of 60◦ arc span, 35 projections suggest that lack of small and sharp structures
in XCAT breast phantoms resulted in lower spectral density at higher frequencies than that of
Bakic phantoms.

made more fixations on images with the Bakic phantom backgrounds than XCAT breast
backgrounds. This difference is significant (p−value < 0.01) in lesion absent images only.
A possible explanation for this difference may be that the greater anatomical noise of Bakic
phantom backgrounds than the XCAT breast backgrounds (see Fig.6) made observers less
confident and hence spent longer time to make decision.
Spearman rank correlation coefficient was computed between the average values of each

gaze metric and the AUC values of both phantom types and densities. Table I shows that
all of the estimated gaze metrics have good correlation with diagnostic performance. Our
observation of first hit time, lesion dwell time, and number of fixations on lesion showed
that the observers took longer to first fixate on the lesion, spent less cumulative time on
lesion, and had fewer fixations on the lesion as the task difficulty increased due to higher
16breast density. No significant difference was observed in these gaze metrics due to change
of phantom type in lesion present images. This result indicates that lesion visibility or
task difficulty is a major factor in defining the gaze pattern in lesion present images where
as anatomical complexity is the major factor influencing the gaze pattern in lesion absent
images. First hit time showed a strong negative (-0.85) correlation with the AUC values
as shown in figure 8. This result suggest that the quicker an observer fixate on the lesion
the better the diagnostic performance which is in accordance with the observation made
by Kundel et al [59]. The positive correlation of lesion fixations and dwell time with AUC
suggests that observers fixate the lesion longer and multiple times to locate accurately. All
the five gaze metrics showed significant correlation (p−value < 0.01) with AUC values.

IV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
This work evaluated the influence of variations between digital breast phantoms on DBT
optimization and interpretation process for a small lesion localization task. Our results in-
dicate that the phantoms should have adequate structures at spatial frequencies that are
relevant for the signal size and the intended task for sufficient realism. We observed that
optimal number of projections for peak detection performance could change with the struc-
tural complexity of the phantoms. In addition, we observed that the number of projections
required to achieve maximum performance is smaller for XCAT breast phantoms than for
17Bakic phantoms. Our power spectrum analysis revealed that the complex structures in
Bakic phantoms contribute to high frequencies while the high-frequency content of XCAT
breastphantomsshowedloweramplitudes. Thesehigh-frequencystructuresresultedinmore
aliasing artifacts in Bakic phantom backgrounds compared to XCAT breast phantom back-
grounds under similar sparse sampling conditions. Hence, more projections were required
to resolve these high-frequency structures in Bakic phantom backgrounds.
Our gaze analysis suggest that all the five gaze metrics showed good correlation with
diagnostic performance, which is in accordance with the observations made by Voisin at al
[60] in mammograpy. This result indicates that gaze metrics and interpretation process were
influenced by the task difficulty. Hence, these gaze metrics can be used to understand the
task difficulty in VIT imaging.
In this study, we evaluated the optimal number of projections in an arc span of 60◦,
which is wider than the arc ranges used in the clinical DBT systems. The arc samplings
between the adjacent projections for peak performance were approximately 2.5◦ and 6◦ in
Bakic and XCAT breast phantoms respectively for 3-mm lesion detection task. For other
arc spans, we expect similar amount of aliasing artifacts for the similar arc sampling. Thus
our conclusions should hold for other arc spans used in clinical DBT prototypes which have
not been examined here in our VIT study.
The difference in the optimal arc sampling from VIT conducted with two widely used
phantom types, raises the need to standardize and unify the frequency contents and com-
plexity of digital phantoms if results published from multiple groups need to be compared.
The goal of our study was not to determine if one of the two phantoms are favorable or
better than the other for use in VIT for breast. It is likely that the perceived realism and
correlation with observer performance for VIT with actual clinical imaging trials would show
results in favor of one of these phantoms based on the chosen task and the signal type.
One of the limitations of our study is that only 3 observers participated in estimating
AUC trends. This number is smaller than the number of observers participated in DBT
optimization studies in literature[44, 65–67]. However, the observers had higher agreement
with each other which is backed by our estimation of intraclass correlation coefficient value
of greater than 0.92. Secondly, we also estimated correlation between the average AUC
18trends of Bakic and XCAT breast phantoms. The spearman rank correlation of 0.2 suggests
that the two trends are not similar.
Furthermore, the study was conducted only for the task of searching and locating a
3-mm spherical lesion as conducting human observer studies for different signal sizes and
types is time consuming and expensive. Prior studies suggest that smaller (high frequency)
lesions dictate the optimal number of projections because their visibility is affected more by
both aliasing artifacts (at lower number of projections) and random noise (mainly at higher
number of projections) [23, 43]. Many studies also used 3-mm [22, 23, 37] and similar sizes
[44, 66–68] of lesions as a signal target in optimization studies. We believe that for larger
signals the differences in optimal arc sampling due to differences in the selected phantom
structuresmaybelessevidentthanthatofsmallersignals. Wechoseaspherelesionastarget
because detecting a sphere lesion is relatively easy task compared to complex spicule lesion
study, hence requiring minimal training. In addition, the performance of non-radiologists
and radiologists was shown to be similar for relatively easy tasks [69] and multiple studies
have used spherical lesions in virtual imaging trials[22, 23, 37, 43, 44]. On the other hand,
for high contrast smaller signals such as micro-calcification, random noise was shown to be
the dominating factor in determining the optimal configuration rather than the background
structures.[43] Future studies will include signals of different sizes and types.
Another limitation of our study is that only six phantoms (to generate a much larger
number of independent cases in each study set) were selected for each phantom type, this
sample may not represent the entire population of each phantom type. Although, our goal
was not to compare between Bakic and XCAT phantoms, but to validate how optimization
estimation changes with phantoms that were generated differently. One may chose 6 phan-
toms in their studies in evaluating optimal configurations as some of the studies in literature
chosearound2to9phantoms[11,15,65–67]. IftheselectednewphantomshavesimilarNPS
properties, we anticipate the similar differences in the optimal number of projections. In-
stead, if the selected phantoms have different NPS properties and results in different optimal
number of projections, which strengthens our argument that phantom structures influence
the estimation of system optimal configurations. The selected phantoms (25% and 50%
dense) are in the higher range of breast densities observed in the clinical data. The average
19AUC trends (see figure 5) did not change due to change of breast density, suggesting that
AUC trends may remain same for other density phantoms. These results also point to the
need to include more phantoms with variations in VIT studies.
In conclusion, our results indicate that both the structural complexity and the relevant
spatial frequency magnitudes in digital phantom structures can influence the estimation of
optimal system configurations. Our results highlight the importance of accurate modeling
of phantoms to resemble the patient anatomy and the importance of assessment for their
realism (for chosen tasks) before use in VITs. This results can be generalized to digital
phantoms used for multiple imaging modalities. As a final note, our goal in this particular
study was not to discuss superiority of one phantom type over the other based on results
shownhere. ThekeyaspectisfortheVITandmedicalphysicscommunitytobemindfulthat
optimization or other results shown using one ”realistic” breast phantom may not always
agree with results when using another ”realistic” phantom unless additional standardization
efforts are pursued.
