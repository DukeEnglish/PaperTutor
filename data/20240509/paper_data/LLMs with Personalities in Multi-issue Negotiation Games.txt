ABSTRACT
Poweredbylargelanguagemodels(LLMs),AIagentshavebecomecapableofmanyhumantasks. Using
the most canonical definitions of the Big Five personality, we measure the ability of LLMs to negotiate
within a game-theoretical framework, as well as methodological challenges to measuring notions of
fairness and risk. Simulations (n=1,500) for both single-issue and multi-issue negotiation reveal increase
in domain complexity with asymmetric issue valuations improve agreement rates but decrease surplus
from aggressive negotiation. Through gradient-boosted regression and shapley explainers, we find high
openness, conscientiousness, and neuroticism are associated with fair tendencies; low agreeableness
and low openness are associated with rational tendencies. Low conscientiousness is associated with
hightoxicity. TheseresultsindicatethatLLMsmayhavebuilt-inguardrailsthatdefaulttofairbehavior,but
can be “jail broken” to exploit agreeable opponents. We also offer pragmatic insight in how negotiation
bots can be designed, and a framework of assessing negotiation behavior based on game theory and
computational social science.

Negotiationisafundamentaltaskforhumans. Itisaprocesswherepartiescansettleissues,discover

economics1,2, business3–6, communication7,8, and behavioral psychology9,10. In the social sciences, a
significantstreamconsidershowindividualdifferencescontributetodivergentoutcomesinnegotiation.
In particular, personality traits have been shown to modulate bargaining in a few different ways. The
BigFivepersonalitytraits,particularlyneuroticism,extraversion,andagreeableness,areassociatedwith
collaborative,compromising,orcollaborativebehavior11,12. Personalityalsohasinfluencesonultimatum

Intandem,negotiationcanalsobeformalizedthroughthelensofgametheory,specificallybargaining
games. Canonically, a negotiation game is a two player game where players divide one or more issues,
with each issue being valued differently by each agent. Each agent aims to maximize their utility. At

For instance, it has been shown AI agents can "jailbroken" using persuasion techniques24. We build

With LLMs at our disposal, the combination of both the quantitative and qualitative dimension of

Negotiation games
Toassesstheabilityofdifferentpersonalityagentstonegotiatewitheachother,wecreatedtentypesof
agents to compete against each other in both single- and multi-issue negotiations. In each game, two
agents werecreated as distinct instancesof the gpt-4-turbo model usingthe ChatGPT API. Eachagent
was defined as one of ten personality types: either a high or low level of openness, conscientiousness,
extroversion,agreeableness, orneuroticism. Agentpersonalities wereinitialized [or Thesystem content
ofeachagentwasinitialized]basedonpersonalityfacetsdescribedbyHowardandHoward31.
Each agent played against all other agents, including itself, as both the first player to make an offer
(P1) and the first player to respond to an offer (P2). For single-issue negotiations, agents divided $100.
For multi-issue negotiations, agents divided 10 apples, 10 bananas, and 10 crepes, which they valued
according to a preference profile. P1 valued apples at $1, bananas at $2, and crepes at $3. P2 had an
oppositevaluationofapplesat$3,bananasat$2,andcrepesat$1. Agentstookturnsrespondingtoand

ThepurposeofthisexperimentistoanalyzehoweffectivedifferentLLM-agentpersonalitiesareat
negotiating with a deadline. Thus, it is important to consider the negotiations from a game theoretic
perspective. In a sixround game betweentwo rational agents, P2has a massive advantage asit is always
able to make the final offer. P2 will decline all proposals until the final round, where it will offer the
2/17minimum to P1. P1 will accept any offer with a greater payoff than $0 because if it declines, the game
will end in default and P1 will receive nothing. Thus, the Nash Equilibrium, or the outcome assuming

Agreeableness and Domain Complexity

personalities tended to be more accommodating, more passive, and less ambitious, with personality facets
suchas"willingtohelpothers","opentoreexaminingvalues","slowtoanger",and"staysinbackground".

Conditionalonanagreementbeingmade,lowagreeablenessleadstohighreturns. Inthesingle-issue
case,Figure1bshowsthatlowagreeablenessandlowopenness,thepersonalitieswiththehighestdefault

agreeableness still had one of the highest returns, it did not have as extreme of an advantage over the
otherpersonalities. Infact,highagreeablenessandhighopennesshadaverysimilaraveragepayoff. This
is because in multi-issue games, these more cooperative personalities were best able to use the agents’
differingpreferenceprofilestofindmoreefficientandlucrativedeals.
Overall, wefind thatdomaincomplexity withasymmetric issuevaluations tendstoincrease payoffs
for agents. Figure 1a shows that allagents achieved higher payoffsin the multi-issue negotiations than the
single-issue negotiations. One reason for this is a lower default rate in multi-issue negotiations. While
agents came to an agreement in only 64.3% of single-issue games, they reached agreement in 89.0%
of games in the multi-issue case. However, the increased payoff average in multi-issue games was not
solely caused by more frequent agreements; Figure 1b shows that even with defaulted games removed,
almost all agents had a higher payoff in multi-issue games. This is because in multi-issue games, the
differentpreferencesofissuesallowsagentstofindsynergistictrade-offsthatincreasebothagents’utilities.
Multi-issuegames allowforbetter deals,which results inmore agreements. Together, theseanswerRQ1
andRQ2.

Additionally,wefindsomeLLMagentstendtoactvindictivelyratherthanrationally. Inasixround
game between two rational agents, P2 should have a large advantage because P1 will accept anything
it offers in the final round. However, Figure 2b indicates that P1 slightly outperforms P2 in many of
these multi-issue games. This may be due to irrational spitefulness. Out of 130 multi-issue games that
progressedtothefinalround,only66concludedinadeal. 49.2%ofthetime,agentsdecidedtodecline

However, some agents such as low agreeableness and low openness have negative scores, which may

Exploitation against other agents
Figure 3. Payoffsin(a)single-issuebargaininggamesbyhead-to-headmatchupand(b)multi-issue
bargaininggamesbetweenHi-AgreeandLo-Agreepersonalities,excludinggamesendingindefault.
Next,weconsiderthehead-to-headbehaviorofagents. Figure3showsthepayoffsofagentpersonali-
ties against each individual opponent. We find that in the single-issue case, low agreeableness heavily
exploits other personalities. Figure 3a shows the payoffs for each personality as P1 against every other
personalitywhenanagreementwasmade. ThepayoffsoftheP2agentscanbefoundbysubtractingthe
P1 payoffs from the $100 being split. This shows that although low agreeableness led to high default
rates,itwasabletonegotiatelargeadvantageswhenagentsdidfindagreement. Lowagreeablenesswas
particularlyeffectiveatexploitinghighagreeableness,highneuroticism,andlowconscientiousness. Itdid
notreachagreementwithhighconscientiousness,lowagreeableness,andlowopenness. Lowopenness
5/17wasalso exploitative, especially againsthigh agreeableness. High agreeablenesswas themost exploitable
personalityandwasnotabletooutperformanypersonalityitfaced.
In the multi-issue case, exploitation was not as pronounced. Figure 3b shows the payoff heat map
of games between high agreeableness and low agreeableness in multi-issue games. The figure has the
payoffsofcertainoutcomesplottedas(x,y,z)wherexistheperspectiveplayer’s$1valueditem,yistheir
$2valueditem,andzistheir$3valueditem. Whileinthesingle-issuecase,lowagreeablenessdominated
the match up, earning $67/100 as P1 and $59/100 as P2, in this scenario the outcomes are much more
even. This is because in a multi-issue case, each player’s most valuable and sought after resource is its
opponent’sleastvaluable. Inotherwords,agentsareabletoidentifycomplementaryinterests. Thismakes
efficiencyimportantinsecuringthebestoutcomes.
Another way to understand this is through the Pareto frontier, or the set of outcomes that cannot
improve the payoff of one player without decreasing the payoff of the other player. Outcomes outside
oftheParetofrontierareinefficientbecauseatleastoneplayer’spayoffcouldbeimprovedatnocostto
itsopponent. Inthisscenario,theParetofrontierwhereutilitiesaremaximizedarethepointsontheline

Feature Analysis

Lastly, we evaluate which of these personality, linguistic features, and domain-specific variables
influencetheresultantpayoff. Webuildagradient-boostingmodelusingCatBoost32,apopulartree-based
regressor. However, while machine learning techniques like gradient boosting yield higher accuracies
thancanonicalstatistics,their“blackbox”naturehaslimitedtheirinterpretability. Inrecentyears,SHAP
6/17Explainers have become a common tool for understanding feature importance. The algorithm is based
on Shapley Values in game theory, which focuses on calculating the utility contributions of individual
players to a coalition of players33. Instead of players, SHAP evaluates power sets of features and their
contributiontominimizingerrorinthemodel34.

Discussion
Inthispaper,wemakeafirstattemptofunderstandingthebehaviorofpersonality-endowedLLMsfroma
gametheoreticandrhetoricalperspective. Throughourfiveresearchquestiononindividualandpair-wise
performance, we have three main generalizations. First, we find that more agreeable agents have the
highestpayoffsbutareexploitablebylessagreeableagents. Inaheterogeneousenvironment,ourresearch
indicatesthatnegotiationbotswithhighagreeablenesswillbeabletomakedealswithabroadrangeof
customers,butbotswithlowagreeablenesswillbeabletoexploitandgetmaximumvaluewhenadeal
ismade. However,inmulti-issuenegotiations,agentsthatareexploitativeorcollaborativecansucceed,
dependingontheiropponent.
Second, the behavior of these agents are generally fair rather than rational. From a game theory
perspective, these agents have a lot of irrationality. One clear example is agents refusing final offers,
resultinginalotoflostutility. LLMnegotiationbotswillneedalogic-basedcounterparttoexhibitfull
rational behavior in the marketplace. On the other hand, this may serve as an innate guardrail to limit
exploitationagainsthumans.
Third, we offer some insight to negotiation bot design. From a linguistics perspective, bots with
fairness-based argumentswill be able to reach moredeals while bots with rational arguments will extract
increased value. Assertive language is highly beneficial for a bot, as it increases both agreement rate
and extracted value. However, more aggressive personalities do tend to be more toxic, and developers
willneedtoweighthepotentialpayoffbenefitsofthisstylewithanegativenegotiatingenvironment,or
disentangleassertivenesswithaggression.
This study has a few limitations. First, we cannot be certain that these LLM-based personalities
correspondtothehuman-conceptionofthesetraits. However,ourfocusis onhowtheseLLMs inherently
encode these definitions and their subsequent behavior. Our work clearly shows asymmetric behavior
basedonthe initializationoftheseagents,that tendtoward existing definitions. Furtherworkcanbedone
toalignLLMbehaviortothehumanconceptionofthebigfivetypology,suchasusingsurveyresultsto
fine-tuneresponses. Second,thisexperimentwasdoneonmulti-issuenegotiationswithcomplementary
preference profiles. Research should be done on multi-issue negotiations with symmetric preference
profiles and how various personalities perform in a situation where no surplus value can be made from
efficient deals. In other words, by shrinking the zone of potential agreement, results may tend toward
the single-issue case. Overall, thispaper provides astandardized wayof evaluatingthe performanceof
agentswith differentpersonalities,using well-establishedapproachesfrom computationalsocialscience
andgametheory.

flagged for having too many numbers in the final confirmation (e.g. anagent stated its outcome and its
opponent’s outcome when instructed to state its outcome) or the agent outcomes did not match (e.g. a

(submissive, assertive), and (naive, cutthroat), indicating how relatively closely the text aligned with

the agent was low in that trait, and 0 if the agent was based on a different trait. There was one binary
