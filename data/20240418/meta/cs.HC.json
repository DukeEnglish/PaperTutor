        "summary": "The ubiquity and on-the-go availability of mobile devices makes them central\nto many tasks such as interpersonal communication and media consumption.\nHowever, despite the potential of mobile devices for on-demand exploratory data\nvisualization, existing mobile interactions are difficult, often using highly\ncustom interactions, complex gestures, or multi-modal input. We synthesize\nlimitations from the literature and outline four motivating principles for\nimproved mobile interaction: leverage ubiquitous modalities, prioritize\ndiscoverability, enable rapid in-context data exploration, and promote graceful\nrecovery. We then contribute thirteen interaction candidates and conduct a\nformative study with twelve participants who experienced our interactions in a\ntestbed prototype. Based on these interviews, we discuss design considerations\nand tradeoffs from four main themes: precise and rapid inspection, focused\nnavigation, single-touch and fixed orientation interaction, and judicious use\nof motion.",

        "summary": "Privacy is a human right. It ensures that individuals are free to engage in\ndiscussions, participate in groups, and form relationships online or offline\nwithout fear of their data being inappropriately harvested, analyzed, or\notherwise used to harm them. Preserving privacy has emerged as a critical\nfactor in research, particularly in the computational social science (CSS),\nartificial intelligence (AI) and data science domains, given their reliance on\nindividuals' data for novel insights. The increasing use of advanced\ncomputational models stands to exacerbate privacy concerns because, if\ninappropriately used, they can quickly infringe privacy rights and lead to\nadverse effects for individuals - especially vulnerable groups - and society.\nWe have already witnessed a host of privacy issues emerge with the advent of\nlarge language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, which further demonstrate the\nimportance of embedding privacy from the start. This article contributes to the\nfield by discussing the role of privacy and the primary issues that researchers\nworking in CSS, AI, data science and related domains are likely to face. It\nthen presents several key considerations for researchers to ensure participant\nprivacy is best preserved in their research design, data collection and use,\nanalysis, and dissemination of research results.",

        "summary": "This paper introduces a relational perspective on ethics within the context\nof Feminist Digital Civics and community-led design. Ethics work in HCI has\nprimarily focused on prescriptive machine ethics and bioethics principles\nrather than people. In response, we advocate for a community-led, processual\napproach to ethics, acknowledging power dynamics and local contexts. We thus\npropose a multidimensional adaptive model for ethics in HCI design, integrating\nan intersectional feminist ethical lens. This framework embraces feminist\nepistemologies, methods, and methodologies, fostering a reflexive practice. By\nweaving together situated knowledges, standpoint theory, intersectionality,\nparticipatory methods, and care ethics, our approach offers a holistic\nfoundation for ethics in HCI, aiming to advance community-led practices and\nenrich the discourse surrounding ethics within this field.",

        "summary": "Multitasking with a touch screen user-interface while driving is known to\nimpact negatively driving performance and safety. Literature shows that list\nscrolling interfaces generate more visual-manual distraction than structured\nmenus and sequential navigation. Depth and breadth trade-offs for structured\nnavigation have been studied. However, little is known on how secondary task\ncharacteristics interact with those trade-offs. In this study, we make the\nhypothesis that both menu's depth and task complexity interact in generating\nvisual-manual distraction. Using a driving simulation setup, we collected\ntelemetry and eye-tracking data to evaluate driving performance. Participants\nwere multitasking with a mobile app, presenting a range of eight depth and\nbreadth trade-offs under three types of secondary tasks, involving different\ncognitive operations (Systematic reading, Search for an item, Memorize items'\nstate). The results confirm our hypothesis. Systematic interaction with menu\nitems generated a visual demand that increased with menu's depth, while visual\ndemand reach an optimum for Search and Memory tasks. We discuss implications\nfor design: In a multitasking context, display design effectiveness must be\nassessed while considering menu's layout but also cognitive processes involved.",

        "summary": "Satellite imagery is regarded as a great opportunity for citizen-based\nmonitoring of activities of interest. Relevant imagery may however not be\navailable at sufficiently high resolution, quality, or cadence -- let alone be\nuniformly accessible to open-source analysts. This limits an assessment of the\ntrue long-term potential of citizen-based monitoring of nuclear activities\nusing publicly available satellite imagery. In this article, we demonstrate how\nmodern game engines combined with advanced machine-learning techniques can be\nused to generate synthetic imagery of sites of interest with the ability to\nchoose relevant parameters upon request; these include time of day, cloud\ncover, season, or level of activity onsite. At the same time, resolution and\noff-nadir angle can be adjusted to simulate different characteristics of the\nsatellite. While there are several possible use-cases for synthetic imagery,\nhere we focus on its usefulness to support tabletop exercises in which simple\nmonitoring scenarios can be examined to better understand verification\ncapabilities enabled by new satellite constellations and very short revisit\ntimes.",
