VI. CONCLUSION
This work presents a one-shot goal assignment policy for
distributingmultiple agentsalong a circular boundaryencom-
passing the agents. Utilizing the geometry of convex layers,
a search space region is proposed for each of the agents.

Regardless of the initial arrangement of agents, the proposed

the region considered in Example 1 for 100 scenarios.
a point in the search space of an agent is closer to that agent
as comparedto any other agentlying within or on the convex
layer on which the agent lies. A statistical analysis of path
lengths in an example scenario shows that the average path
length of agents remains very close to the average of the
minimum Euclidean distance between their initial positions
and the circular boundary. In contrast to the existing works,
the proposed policy resolves conflicts at the initial time, and
no further computations are required for detecting collisions,
or altering speed or heading angle of the agents thereafter.
Future research directions include three-dimensional distri-
bution of agents on regular or irregular boundaries.
