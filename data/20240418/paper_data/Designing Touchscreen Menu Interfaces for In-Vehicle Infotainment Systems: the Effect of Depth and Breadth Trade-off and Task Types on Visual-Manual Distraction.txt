Twenty-eight participants took part in this

for at least three years (9.8±6.8, m ± sd) and
with a normal or corrected-to-normal vision.

Eye-tracking data were coded in a frame-by-

detecting whether the participant was looking

Before calculating averages, we extracted
from telemetry and eye-tracking data the slices
of time corresponding to when a secondary
task was in execution. Parametric statistical
tests(generalizedlinearregressionmodel)were
used whenever the validity conditions were
met. Otherwise, we used non-parametric tests.
