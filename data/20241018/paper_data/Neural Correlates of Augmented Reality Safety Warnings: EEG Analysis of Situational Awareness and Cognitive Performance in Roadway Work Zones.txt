Abstract
Despite the research and implementation efforts involving various safety strategies, proto-
cols, and technologies, work zone crashes and fatalities continue to occur at an alarming rate
each year. This study investigates the neurophysiological responses to Augmented Reality
safety warnings in roadway work zones under varying workload conditions. Using electroen-
cephalogram (EEG) technology, we objectively assessed situational awareness, attention, and
cognitive load in simulated low-intensity (LA) and moderate-intensity (MA) work activities.
The research analyzed key EEG indicators including beta, gamma, alpha, and theta waves,
as well as various combined wave ratios. Results revealed that AR warnings effectively trig-
gered neurological responses associated with increased situational awareness and attention
across both workload conditions. However, significant differences were observed in the tim-
ing and intensity of these responses. In the LA condition, peak responses occurred earlier
(within 125 ms post-warning) and were more pronounced, suggesting a more robust cog-
nitive response when physical demands were lower. Conversely, the MA condition showed
delayed peak responses (125-250 ms post-warning) and more gradual changes, indicating a
potential impact of increased physical activity on cognitive processing speed. These findings
underscore the importance of considering physical workload when designing AR-based safety
systems for roadway work zones. The research contributes to the understanding of how AR
can enhance worker safety and provides insights for developing more effective, context-aware
safety interventions in high-risk work environments.

1. Introduction
Roadway construction and maintenance are essential for sustaining highway performance,
supporting national economic growth, and meeting the growing transportation demands of
communities. Consequently, work zones are an integral aspect of roadway operation, mainte-
nance, and construction activities, and play a fundamental role in advancing and supporting
these socio-economic and transportation goals. However, despite the implementation and

fatalities continue to occur at an alarming rate each year. The Bureau of Transportation
Statistics reports a consistent increase in work zone fatalities since 2010, with 2,066 fatal
work injuries occurring in the transportation sector in 2022 alone [1].
To address safety issues in high-risk workplace environments, researchers have explored
the use of innovative technologies such as Augmented Reality (AR) to manage safety hazards
in these environments [2, 3, 4]. In roadway work zones, these technologies are often intended
to notify workers of potential intrusions and offer them additional time and information to
respondtohazards[5,6]. Forthispurpose, ARhasparticularlyattractedresearchers’interest
because it can deliver real-time information overlays directly in workers’ field of view, and
enhance their understanding of safety risks [7, 8].
While the use of AR to improve workplace safety is expanding across various domains,
there remains a significant gap in research that objectively assesses and quantifies the im-
pact of AR-based safety systems on situational awareness, attention, and cognitive load.
Situational awareness encompasses the perception of the elements in the environment over
time and space, comprehending their meaning, and anticipating their near-future status [9].
With this, real-time safety systems, including AR-based solutions, are designed to enhance
workers’ real-time decision-making capabilities through increased situational awareness [10],
improve reaction times, and reduce information overload. This is particularly important in
workplace safety, where research has shown that most accidents are caused by poor situa-
tional awareness [10]. In previous research, Caperllera et al. [11] analyzed the human-vehicle
interaction to support driver’s situational awareness in automated vehicles. Aromaa et al.
[12] assessed the industrial operators’ awareness of the real-world environment when using
augmented reality and Yu et al. [13] determined the cognitive ergonomics-based AR applica-
tion for construction performance. While these studies are valuable for advancing precedent
understanding, some oftheseworks lack objectivityandrely solelyonsubjectiveassessments,
while others are not specific to roadway work zones.
Furthermore, the effect of workload on situational awareness remains relatively under-
exploredinthecontextofroadwayworkzones. Physicalworkloadhasbeenshowntoinfluence
situational awareness [14, 15]. This is particularly relevant in roadway work zones, where
workers are often engaged in physical tasks. The effects of high physical workload can lead
to increased error rates, exhibiting unsafe behaviors, and diminished situational awareness
[16]. Such reductions in situational awareness can impair workers’ ability to identify and
analyze hazards, make projections, and maintain control, ultimately resulting in poor safety
decisions [10].
To address the research needs outlined above, this study investigates the use of elec-
troencephalogram (EEG) technology to objectively assess neurophysiological responses to
simulated AR-based safety warnings in roadway work zones under different workload condi-
tions. The objectives of this study are to (1) evaluate the effectiveness of AR multi-sensory
warnings in enhancing situational awareness and attention in a simulated roadway work zone
under varying workload conditions, using EEG-based brain wave analysis, (2) quantify and
compare the cognitive load experienced by workers under varying workload conditions when
exposed to AR multi-sensory warnings, utilizing EEG-derived cognitive load metrics. (3) ex-
amine the relationship between subjective assessments of situational awareness and objective
EEG-based metrics.
2This study contributes to the body of knowledge by advancing our understanding of aug-
mented reality’s potential to enhance safety and efficiency in high-risk roadway work zone
environments. By integrating AR with VR simulations and utilizing advanced neurophys-
iological measures, this research quantifies the impacts of AR multi-sensory warnings on
worker situational awareness, attention, and cognitive load. It provides evidence on how AR
multi-sensory warnings can impact the situational awareness and attention of workers as well
as cognitive load. The use of EEG-based brain wave analysis allows for a precise, real-time
assessment of how sensory inputs influence cognitive processes crucial for safety and perfor-
mance. The EEG-derived metrics employed provide a deeper understanding of how AR tools
can be designed to avoid cognitive overload, thereby optimizing worker performance and re-
ducing potential errors. Another important aspect of this research is the examination of the
relationship between subjective measures of situational awareness and objective EEG-based
metrics.
The findings from this study inform the design of future AR systems for safety-sensitive
applications. By demonstrating the specific conditions under which AR multi-sensory warn-
ings aremost effective, this researchguides developers increating user-centered AR interfaces
that adapt to varying cognitive demands. Furthermore, the methodology developed can be
applied in other fields where AR might be used, such as manufacturing and military opera-
tions, thereby broadening the impact of this work. In summary, this study not only extends
the theoretical frameworks of cognitive load, attention and situational awareness in the con-
text of AR and VR but also provides practical insights that can lead to the development of
more effective and safer AR applications in professional environments.

2.1. Enhancing Situational Awareness Using Augmented Reality
Augmentedrealityhasemergedasapromisingtechnologyforenhancingsituationalaware-
ness across various domains. By overlaying real-time information onto users’ environments,
AR enables a more comprehensive understanding of surroundings and maintains situational
awareness [17]. In the transportation sector, AR has been employed in driving context to im-
prove drivers’ SA in multiple scenarios, including detecting vehicles and pedestrians [18, 19],
navigation [20], identifying road signs and providing AR driving assistance to novice drivers
[20, 21]. Wohn et al. [22] compared navigation using 2D maps (e.g., Google Maps) to an
AR-enabled navigation and found that AR navigation led to faster route decisions at com-
plex points, though it increased cognitive workload. In the context of worker safety, AR was
used in roadway work zones [5, 6] for advanced warning delivery to workers. In construction
industry, AR was examined for facility mangers to augment information about the facilities
they maintain [23] where Using AR led to lower cognitive workload and faster detection
of information. Wallmyr et al. [24] investigated if AR could benefit the SA of excavator
operators in a simulated excavator environment with augmented icons would appear on the
simulated windshield. Using AR led to lower cognitive workload and faster detection of infor-
mation. Ramos-Hurtado et al. [25] investigated the deployment of AR in construction safety,
proposing a methodology to enhance safety inspections through AR technology. Their study
identified the key performance indicators needed for effective safety inspections and demon-
strated how AR could improve situational awareness (SA) by superimposing virtual safety
3elements onto real construction sites. Lukosch et al. [26] explored the use of augmented re-
ality (AR) to improve situational awareness and collaboration in the security domain. Their
study found that AR enhances information exchange and situational awareness, particularly
for remote users, leading to better team collaboration during security operations. In mili-
tary and security applications, AR has been examined for flying Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
(UAVs) [27], augmenting representation of friendly or hostile forces[28, 29], navigation aids
[28, 30], and visualization of occluded entities [31]. The industrial sector has explored the use
of AR for monitoring production processes [32] and providing maintenance [33]. In the medi-
cal field, studies have looked into using AR to aid in monitoring patient information [34]. The
aforemoentioned AR applications across different domains have utilized various mechanisms
to augment the real world, including through smartphone apps [35, 21], heads-up displays in
cars [36, 18], and AR eyewear [6].
While research has demonstrated the significance of AR in enhancing situational aware-
ness, most studies have focused on applicability and usability, with only a few systematically
assessing situational awareness. Among these, most relied on subjective measures, such as
post-trial ratings using the Situation Awareness Rating Technique (SART) [37] and tech-
niques such as the freeze-probe recall method using Situation Awareness Global Assessment
Technique (SAGAT) [38]. This highlights a gap in the current literature, where objective and
comprehensive assessments of AR’s impact on situational awareness are still under explored,
particularly for delivering augmented reality warnings for worker safety. Furthermore, some
studies have shown that while AR can improve SA, it may also result in increased cogni-
tive workload in certain applications. The performance of AR highly depends on its design;
poorly designed systems in SA-critical domains could lead to severe consequences, including
aircraft crashes [39], medical errors [40], and worker injuries or fatalities.
In summary, while AR has demonstrated potential for enhancing SA, there is a need for
moreresearchfocusedonobjectivemeasuresofSA,suchaswearabletechnologythatcaptures
brain activity data. Utilizing these objective measures in the design of AR technologies could
help optimize information presentation, reducing distraction and cognitive load.
2.2. Capturing Psyhco-physiological and Behavioral Data to Quantify Situational Awareness
and Cognitive Metrics
A review of the literature reveals a diverse array of methods utilized to evaluate and
measure SA through various cognitive metrics. These methods can be classified into sub-
jective and objective approaches. Subjective approaches primarily rely on inputs from par-
ticipants or observers, typically collected after trial completion. These methods often use
questionnaires and include freeze probe recall, real-time probe, post trial subjective rating,
and observer rating techniques [41]. Some examples include SAGAT [38], situation present
assessment method (SPAM) [42], SART [37], Situation Awareness Behavioral Rating Scale
(SABARS) [43], and Low-Event Task Subjective Situation Awareness (LETSSA) [44] for
SA measurement. Similar subjective approaches have also been developed for cognitive load
assessment. These methods include the NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) [45] and Sub-
jective Workload Assessment Technique (SWAT) [46]. These frameworks have been applied
in different contexts and offer several advantages, including low-cost implementation in both
simulations and real-world scenarios, ease of use, and adaptability to different contexts with
minimal modifications [47]. However, they have also faced criticisms [48, 49]. Some ex-
4amples of these criticisms include susceptibility to biases in post-trial feedback, impact of
task interruptions on human subjects’ cognitive performance, close and unduly association
with workload, inconsistent interpretation strategies in different domains, and poor align-
ment with performance-based evaluations. A review of 37 studies by Endsley [47] including
both objective and subjective measures of situational awareness highlighted a dissociation in
outcomes of subjective and objective methodologies across a wide range of measurements.
This disconnect was mainly attributed to the lack of meta-awareness about one’s own SA,
poor calibration, and confounds with workload [47].
In contrast, objective methodologies often involve the use of measurable and quantifiable
data - such as psycho-physiological responses, performance metrics, and task analytics - to
quantify an individual’s SA and cognitive metrics [50, 51]. Historically, researchers have
mainly relied on subjective metrics for evaluation of SA and cognitive metrics; however, the
recent advancements in senors and novel algorithms have propelled studies that prioritize
data-driven approaches for clinical studies in SA and cognitive assessment [52]. To reduce
the influence of subjectivity in assessing SA and cognitive metrics, there is growing interest
in leveraging advanced, data-driven, and sensor-based technologies. These methods aim
to measure SA and cognitive load through psycho-physiological data with minimizing the
reliance on subjective assumptions[53, 54]. For this propose, a wide range of technologies
and metrics has been utilized [55] including: cardiovascular metrics (heart rate, heart rate
variability, inter-beat interval, and normal to normal interval) [56, 57]; respiratory system
metrics(rate, airflow, andvolumeofrespiratorygas)[58]; skin-basedmeasures(electrodermal
activity (EDA), tissue blood volume, skin conductance level, and skin conductance response)
[59]; blood pressure, (pressure during heart muscle contraction and relaxation) [60]; ocular
measures (blink rate, blink duration, blink latency, and pupil size) [61]; and brain activity
measures (electroencephalogram (EEG), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and
functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)) [62]. Although no single method has been
universally recognized as the definitive choice, there is a growing body of literature that
supports the use of these measures for cognitive research [55, 63].
Among cognitive assessment tools, brain activity measures using EEG has emerged as
a high-potential technology [50, 64]. EEG offers a continuous, personalized, and real-time
measure of cognitive metrics at a high temporal resolution. This capability is particularly
useful for understanding the impact of real-time interventions, such as safety warnings, espe-
cially when general measures of cognitive load do not capture specific differences in cognitive
processing [64, 65].
TheoutlinedadvantagesofEEGhaveledtoagrowinginterestinexploringitspotentialfor
assessingdifferentmetricsrelatedtohumancognitiveperformanceacrossdifferentdisciplines,
including safety in workplaces. For instance, Wang et. al [66] proposed a wireless-based EEG
device to objectively track the mental fatigue of construction workers. The EEG signals of 16
humanparticipantswererecordedduringacontinuousphysicalandcognitivetask. Inanother
study,Kastleet. al[67]proposedananalyticalapproachforidentifyingEEGsignalsrelatedto
situational awareness across different brain regions. The proposed methodology was applied
onadatasetcollectedfrom32participantswhocompletedtheSAtestusinga32-channelEEG
headset. Their results analytically pointed to a correlation between some specific frequency
bands of EEG signals and SA. Ren et. al [68] leveraged EEG to quantitatively evaluate
mental workload during task switching of assembly workers. In this study, the authors used
5time-frequencyandspectralanalysestomeasureandreflecttaskdemandsduringtheintervals
between individual tasks.
In spite of increasing interest in using EEG technology for assessing cognitive workload
in workers, especially in vertical construction environments with a focus on safety, a major
gap still remains in understanding how physical engagement affects workers’ real-time SA,
neural responses and cognitive load [15]. While the existing body of knowledge has partially
covered EEG applications in related areas, such as mental states during work at height [69],
the effects of heat stress on cognitive states [70], and mental fatigue in construction fall
hazard prevention [71], to the best of our knowledge, there has been limited exploration
of the objective investigation of relationship between situational awareness, cognitive load,
physical workload, and neurological responses from the perspective of EEG data in high-risk
settings such as highway work zones.
2.3. Methods and Challenges of deriving Cognitive Insights from EEG Signals
Research in neuroergonomics has flourished in recent years, driven by advancements in
noninvasive brain monitoring techniques that can be used to study various aspects of human
behavior in relation to technology and work, including mental workload [72], visual atten-
tion [73], working memory [74], motor control [75], human-automation interaction [76], and
adaptive automation [77].
EEG signal processing methods have allowed for the real-time determination of cognitive
metrics in various disciplines such as education [78] where the authors used brainwaves to
detect the level of attention of students during lecture using Power Spectral Density (PSD)
of the beta band, and fast fourier transform using Welch’s method to demonstrate significant
correlation between PSD and student academic performance. Defense, where [79] used Fast
Fourier Transform, Band power graph values, and non parametric Friedman Test to study
the cognitive levels of tugboat captains during port maneuvers; transportation [80] where
the mental fatigue and drowsiness during car driving in a simulated environment was an-
alyzed and an EEG-based cerebral workload index was proposed for on-line assessment of
drivers; aviation [81] where the cognitive workload of pilots was measured during live-flight
environment using delta, theta, alpha, and beta bands using recursive feature elimination,
lasso cross-validation and stacking ensemble machine learning techniques. Conventional lin-
ear analysis methods including Independent Component Analysis (ICA) [82, 83], Fast Fourier
Transform (FFT) [67], Autoregressive (AR) [84], Wavelet Transform (WT) [85], and Prin-
cipal Component Analysis (PCA) [86, 87] are commonly preferred techniques for analyzing
EEG signals followed by nonlinear analysis methods comprising of correlation dimension
(CD) [88], Hurst exponent (H) [89], Higher Order Spectra (HOS) [90], Fractal dimension
(FD) [91], recurrence plots and phase space plots [92].
Despite significant progress in analyzing the non-stationary nature of EEG indices to
measure human performance, there are still a number of challenges, particularly due to the
presence of noise and artifacts, including those caused by muscle movements, which can
significantly degrade the quality of EEG signals [54, 93, 94]. Additionally, there aren’t many
studies that evaluate human brain signals during multiple simultaneous cognitive tasks that
replicate real-world scenarios [95].
In sumary, deriving cognitive insights from EEG signals in dynamic environments, such as
workers performing tasks in VR simulations, presents some challenges. The primary obstacle
6is artifact contamination due to subject movement, which is inherent in scenarios involving
varying task intensities and responses to warnings. These movement artifacts, combined
with the low signal-to-noise ratio typical of EEG data, make it difficult to distinguish genuine
cognitive signals from noise. The non-stationary nature of EEG signals during dynamic tasks
further complicates analysis. Real-time processing demands for safety-critical applications
add another layer of complexity, requiring efficient algorithms capable of rapid data analysis.

3. Method
3.1. Experimental Design and Procedure
To address the objectives of this study, we designed an experiment in a high-fidelity
virtual reality setting that mirrored a real-world roadway work zone. Participants were im-
mersed in the simulated environment and received multi-sensory augmented reality warnings
while engaged in routine roadway maintenance activities with two different workload inten-
sities. Their brain activity was collected using a wearable electroencephalography (EEG)
technology. The EEG data was then analyzed to evaluate the effectiveness of the AR multi-
sensory warnings in enhancing situational awareness and attention, as well as to quantify
and compare the cognitive load experienced by the participants under different workload
conditions. Furthermore, subjective assessments of cognitive workload were collected from
the participants using NASA-TLX questionnaires.
The University of North Carolina at Charlotte’s Institutional Review Board (IRB) ex-
amined and approved the study protocol (21-0357). Initially, the study’s nature, objectives,
and participant roles were clearly explained to the volunteers and their informed consent was
obtained. Participants were instructed to wash their hair and avoid hair products before
the experiment to ensure the highest recording quality by reducing interference from skin
cells, oily secretions, and sweat. Each task was designed to be completed within a maximum
duration of 2 minutes per task. In the following, we will elaborate on the design of the
experiment, the equipment used, participant characteristics, and EEG data analysis.
3.1.1. Task Design
We designed two tasks categorized as light and moderate intensity to replicate typical ac-
tivitiesperformedbyhighwayworkers, therebyrepresentingthecognitivedemandsassociated
with similar job profiles. The order of participants performing these tasks was randomized
for each participant to reduce bias and the impact of the learning curve.
As shown in Figure 1, the Light Activity (LA) was simulated through an inspection task
in the VR environment, where participants used a tablet to examine an obstructed drop
inlet and inspect the defect by taking a picture. Drop inlets frequently become obstructed
by small debris, especially in areas with high levels of precipitation leading to potential
flooding, erosion of slopes, and contributing to the formation of potholes in the pavement.
Therefore, making this inspection an essential and frequent roadway maintenance task. In
construction, tasks that primarily involve standing, such as briefing, reading construction
plans, and performing inspections, are generally classified as light activities [96]. Such tasks
typically involve minimal physical movement and are associated with low cognitive load.
7Figure 1: Overview of the main component of the methodology: (a) Data Acquisition, (b) data Analysis, (c)
Inferring Cognitive Metrics
Moderate Activity (MA) was represented through the process of eliminating obstruction
from a drop inlet using a leaf blower. In construction, MA tasks require more physical effort,
suchasclearingtheworkzone, locatingtools, movingsmallitems, andmeasuringandcutting
materials [96].
3.1.2. Immerisive Virtual Work Zone Environment
We designed a virtual reality environment to simulate a highway work zone based on the
guidelinesfromtheManualonUniformTrafficControlDevices[97]. Thissimulatedworkzone
previously designed by the research team [5] accurately reflects real-life conditions, featuring
high-fidelity traffic scenarios and detailed 3D models that closely mimic a Short-duration
roadway work zone. The MUTCD defines short-duration work zones as those that occupy
a location up to 1 hour. They are typically used for regular operations and maintenance
tasks. The work zone layout including different areas of the work zone and features of the
VR environment is shown in Figure 2.
In the development of LA task in the VR simulation, a virtual model of a tablet with
image-capturing capability was created within the 3D environment. Participants held a
physical tablet in the real world while viewing its virtual counterpart in the VR environment.
Additionally, a virtual button for capturing images was incorporated into the virtual model,
and completed with a sound effect to enhance the user experience. Building on this approach,
the MA task was designed with a virtual representation of the same real-life leaf blower that
participants physically held and performed the activity in the VR simulation. To enhance
realism, the audio effect of the leaf blower was replicated in the VR environment, and the
simulated environment included collision detection capabilities to simulate the removal of
obstructions from the drop inlet. Examples of these interactions and the developed activities
are illustrated in Figure 3

3.1.3. Safety Warnings
During the experiments, participants received three identical safety warnings. These
warnings were designed to be multimodal, simultaneously delivering haptic, audio, and visual
cuestotheuserswhileperformingtasks. Thewarningsweredesignedtoactivateatconsistent
intervals within a 1-minute scenario (25, 45, and 55 seconds). The purpose of the study
was to evaluate the augmented reality safety warning technology developed by the authors
[5, 98, 99]. To achieve this, the visual cue was delivered through a simulated augmented
reality display within the virtual reality environment, shown in Figure 3(a). Haptic feedback
was delivered from the smartwatch’s API. In the VR simulation, participants could view
a virtual smartwatch while simultaneously wearing a physical smartwatch on their wrist as
shown in Figure 3(b). The auditory warning consisted of a high-pitched beep at 44,100 Hz for
0.2 milliseconds and was delivered through the built-in speakers of a virtual reality headset.
These warning patterns were developed using the framework created by our team [5].

Environment for (a) Light activity and (b) Moderate Activity
93.2. Experimental Equipment and Setup
The immersive virtual reality environment was developed using the Unity 3D game en-
gine [100]and delivered to participants throughthe Oculus Quest2 headset[101]. Augmented
Reality warnings were presented through a simulated AR display within the VR setup. Par-
ticipants used an Amazon Fire Tablet [102] during the LA experiment and a WORX WG509
12Amp leaf blower [103] during the MA experiment. As previously discussed virtual coun-
terparts of these tools were also simulated in the VR environment.
The haptic mode of the warnings during the experiment was delivered using a Samsung
Galaxy Smart Watch [104] facilitated by the Tizen Native framework [105] with a predefined
pattern from the smartwatch’s API.
To collect the brain activity data, we utilized Emotive’s Flex 2 gel product [106], a 32-
channel wireless EEG Head Cap System. The device includes 32 recording electrodes, with
2 reference electrodes fitted on the scalp, and utilizes gel sensors for optimal conductance
to ensure high signal quality with minimal impedance. It uses a 10-20 sensor placement
to capture detailed EEG data at a sampling rate of 128 Hz and is transmitted via wireless
Bluetooth technology to transmit precise contextual data to a host machine, where all the
data is stored. Figure 4 demonstrates the EEG channel locations and channels used in this
study.

3.3. Participants
We initially recruited 20 participants, however, EEG data from 3 participants were not
properly recorded with significant missing data. Consequently, the final participant count
was 17, consisting of 13 males and 4 females, with an average age of 27.12 years (SD = 6.82).
of 17 participants, 12 had an average work experience of 3.92 years (SD = 4.78) and 5 had
no prior work experience.
3.4. EEG Data Processing and Analysis
Wedevelopedathree-stepdataanalysisframeworkdesignedtoprocessrawcollectedEEG
data and extract features that characterize situational awareness, attention, and cognitive
load from the EEG signals. These steps include data cleaning and artifact removal, data
analysis, and the inference of cognitive metrics such as situational awareness, attention, and
cognitive workload.
103.4.1. Data Cleaning and Artifact Removal
The purpose of data pre-processing is to clean and prepare the raw EEG signals through
several key activities—filtering, artifact removal, and re-referencing—to ensure accuracy and
reliability in subsequent analyses. To mitigate noise from the EEG recordings, we used the
HAPPILEE pipeline [107] specifically customized to address the challenges associated with
lower-density EEG recordings typically using 1 to approximately 32 electrodes. This method-
ology has demonstrated effectiveness in identifying and excluding artifacts while preserving
the integrity of the signal [107].
All pre-processing workflows were executed using MATLAB and the EEGLAB toolbox
[108]. Within our pre-processing pipeline, as shown in Figure 1(d), we implemented the
following steps:
1. Removing Power Line Noise Artifacts: We used CleanLine [109] with default param-
eters to eliminate 60Hz power line noise artifacts, particularly the 60 Hz electrical
interference commonly found in EEG recordings. CleanLine is an EEGLab plugin that
usesamulti-taperingregressionapproachtoeliminatethe60Hzelectricalnoiseartifact.
2. Filtering 0.1-50 Hz to Preserve Relevant Brain Activity: We applied a zero-phase
Hamming-windowed synchronous Finite Impulse Response (FIR) bandpass filter with
cutoff frequencies of 0.1 Hz and 50 Hz to the continuous data. This filter preserves rele-
vant brain activity (0.1-50 Hz) and removes low-frequency artifacts below 0.1 Hz, such
as slow drift in the signal caused by sweating or small movements of the electrodes. It
also attenuates high-frequency noise above 50 Hz, which can come from muscle activity
(EMG) or electrical interference from nearby equipment.
3. Artifact Mitigation Through Wavelet Thresholding: WeemployedanempiricalBayesian
threshold that is soft and level-dependent for wavelets, specifically optimized for EEG
data to mitigate artifacts from muscle activity (EMG), eye movements (EOG), and
cardiac signals (ECG) [110].
4. Removing EMG Artifacts: After wavelet thresholding, still a high level of electromyo-
graphic (EMG) artifacts persisted in the data. EMG artifacts are electrical signals gen-
erated by muscle activity, which can significantly contaminate EEG recordings. These
artifacts are particularly problematic because they can occur in frequency ranges that
overlap with brain activity of interest, potentially leading to misinterpretation of the
data. To address this issue, we employed MuscIL (Muscle ICLabel), an automatic
EEG independent component classifier plugin within EEGLAB. MuscIL uses machine
learning algorithms to classify independent components of the EEG signal into different
categories, including brain activity, eye movements, muscle activity, and other artifacts.
Componentslabeledasmuscleactivitywithaprobabilitythresholdofatleast25%were
identified for removal. This threshold was chosen to balance between removing muscle
artifacts and preserving genuine brain activity.
5. Segmentation and Bad Channel Interpolation: Next, we divided the continuous EEG
dataintosmaller,equal-lengthsegmentsorepochs. Inthiscase,thedatawassegmented
into 2-second epochs. This segmentation allows for more focused analysis of specific
time periods and makes it easier to identify and handle artifacts or noise that may
be present in certain parts of the recording. After segmentation, the quality of each
channel within each epoch was assessed. Channels are considered ”noisy” or ”bad” if
11theirsignalfallsbelow-150µVorabove+150µV.Whenabadchannelwasidentified, it
was interpolated, which means its data was estimated based on the surrounding good
channels. This process helps to preserve the overall spatial information of the EEG
while removing unreliable data.
6. Data Re-referencing: Finally, all channels were re-referenced to the average of all 32
scalp electrodes. The naming and spatial location of these electrodes are illustrated in
Figure 4.
3.4.2. Data Analysis
After data cleaning and artifact removal steps, where we pre-processed the raw EEG
data, our methodology includes a pre-analysis step to further adjust and fine-tune the data,
followed by a detailed feature extraction process.
Pre-analysis: In our pre-analysis of the data, we utilized Independent Component Anal-
ysis (ICA) to further remove any remaining artifacts. This last attempt to minimize any
remaining artifacts was also recommended by the guidelines of HAPPILEE [107], the process
weadaptedforthisstudy. ICAisacomputationalmethodforseparatingamultivariatesignal
into additive, independent components. This step was important for isolating and removing
artifacts that may not have been fully addressed during the initial pre-processing phase. Fea-
ture Extraction: After adjusting the data through pre-processing and artifact removal, we
implemented a multi-step feature extraction process to derive meaningful information from
the EEG signals. This process is crucial for transforming the cleaned EEG data into a format
suitable for advanced analysis and interpretation. Our feature extraction approach consisted
of the following key steps:
1. Channel Selection: We focused only on channels located in the prefrontal cortex and
frontal lobe were selected for further analysis, specifically: Fz, Fp1, F7, F3, FC1, FC5,
FT9, FT10, FC6, FC2, F4, F8, and Fp2. This selection was based on the significance of
the frontal lobe in cognitive workload analysis. The frontal lobe is primarily associated
with higher cognitive functions such as problem-solving, memory, language, judgment,
and motor function. Recent research, such as Lo´pez et al. [110] and Tsolisou et al.
[111], has also emphasized the importance of focusing on the frontal lobe due to its
role in executive functions and decision-making processes. By maintaining consistency
in the regions of the brain being analyzed, we ensure that the data reflects the spe-
cific cognitive processes under investigation, leading to more reliable and interpretable
results.
2. Principal Component Analysis (PCA): We utilized PCA to compute a linear combina-
tion of the underlying source signals for the EEG channels. Since using all channels can
be redundant and slow down processing efficiency, PCA helps reduce the dimensional-
ity of the data, which enhances the processing speed of the algorithms and eliminates
redundancy, as demonstrated in previous studies [67, 54].
3. Power Analysis: Usingtime-frequencyanalysis, wedetectedoscillationsinEEGrecords
of participants with power estimation techniques across frequencies ranging from 0.1 to
50 Hz. Time-frequency analysis of EEG signals interprets neural oscillations in terms
of frequency, power, and phase. This analysis reflects fundamental neural mechanisms
across spatial and temporal scales, allowing differentiation of mental states by detecting
12characteristics of oscillations such as magnitude, duration, and intensity spikes. This
was accomplished using a 0.0625-second Hamming window, which was zero-padded to
256 points. For this purpose, we utilized Welch’s method, a well-established technique
for estimating the power spectral density (PSD) of signals, commonly used in signal
processing and particularly in the analysis of time-series data such as EEG signals
[112]. This method allowed us to extract power spectral densities and filter out specific
frequency bands of interest: delta (1-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), beta (12-
30 Hz), and gamma (30-50 Hz). Since delta waves are prevalent during the deep sleep
stage and typically not examined for the assessment of mental effort, we excluded this
frequency band from further analysis.
4. Relative Power Calculation: Given the variability in EEG activation among partici-
pants, in this step we calculated relative power within each frequency band, ensuring
comparability and consistency in the analysis. Also, EEG activation varies across
participants, relative values were utilized in this study. For this purpose, the rela-
tive amount of power within each frequency band was calculated using the following
formula[113], exemplified here for the beta power band:

band (50Hz)
Extracting the Time-Window of Interest: The primary objective of analysis was to ex-
amine brain behavior following augmented reality warnings and compare cognitive metrics
obtained from EEG signals before and after these warnings. To focus on the critical pre- and
post-warning EEG recordings relevant to this study and to reveal the impact of the warn-
ings, we selectively extracted the EEG records from 5-second windows before and after each
warning time in every experiment. Furthermore, to establish a reference state characterizing
participants’ brain activity prior to receiving warnings, we utilized a Baseline Window con-
sisting of the 5 seconds before the warning. For the Post-Warning Window, which spanned
5 seconds after the warning, this period was divided into 20 partitions, each lasting 125
milliseconds. Given the data collection frequency of 128 Hz, each 125-millisecond segment
contained 32 EEG records. These segments were then aggregated for subsequent feature
extraction.
3.4.3. Inferring Cognitive Metrics of Situational Awareness, Attention, and Cognitive Work-
load
After obtaining the frequency bands of brain activity from the data analysis step, we
focused on inferring three cognitive measures: situational awareness, attention, and cognitive
load experienced by workers across different experimental scenarios. As shown in Figure 1
(c), these cognitive measures are linked to one or a combination of frequency bands. Building
on previous research, we incorporated multiple approaches and evaluated them, as detailed
in Table 1 and explained in the following.
13Situational Awareness: InvestigatinghowEEGsignalscanaccuratelyportraySAremains
adynamicandemergingareaofresearch. FollowingasimilarapproachtoKastleetal. (2021)
[67], our study will focus on analyzing the beta (12-30 Hz) and gamma (30-45 Hz) bands in
relation to SA as main brain activity’s metrics. Additionally, we will examine combined EEG
metrics such as θ, α+θ, and θ . Previous studies [114] have found significant correlations
β α+β α+β
between these combined EEG metrics and SA.
Attention: Attention is a significant measurement for assessing human cognitive perfor-
mance. The alpha EEG rhythm, within the alpha-band frequency range, has been commonly
associated with attention [115]. A decrease in the proportion of other waves, such as theta,
is necessary to sustain attention [116]. Also, in cognitive neuroscience, the attention ratio
(α) is a valuable factor for evaluating attentional states during cognitive tasks [117, 118].
β
Cognitive workload: Cognitive workload refers to the number of cognitive resources re-
quired to complete a task or series of tasks, measuring the mental demands placed on an
individual during a particular activity or situation. Various factors can affect cognitive work-
load, including the complexity of the task, the individual’s level of expertise, environmental
conditions, and emotional state. A high mental workload can lead to increased stress, de-
creased performance, and reduced overall well-being. Therefore, evaluating cognitive work-
load (CWL) is essential for understanding human performance and improving task design
across multiple domains, such as aviation, driving, and human-computer interaction [119].
We used both subjective and objective methods to gauge cognitive workload. Subjective
assessment was performed using the NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX), an assessment
tool designed to evaluate the workload experienced by individuals during task performance
It quantifies CWL using a questionnaire that considers six factors: mental demand, physical
demand, temporal demand, performance, effort, and frustration. The objectvie measurement
was accomplished through EEG signal analysis. Research has demonstrated a significant
relationship between EEG signals, in particular, alpha, beta, and theta waves, in different
frequency bands and CWL [120, 121].

154. Results
Following the process outlined in the method section, we conducted an analysis of neural
responses mainly in the frontal lobe, focusing specifically on the α, β, θ, and γ frequency
bands. Inthefollowing,wepresentthefindingsanddiscusstheneurologicalpatternsobserved
for three critical measures of situational awareness, attention, and cognitive load immediately
after the delivery of the safety warnings. We also compare these patterns when participants
were engaged in low-intensity activity versus moderate-intensity activity. Our findings center
on a 500-millisecond (ms) time window following the warning delivery. This interval was
selected based on our observation that beyond 500 ms, the metrics typically returned to
within ±10% of the baseline values, indicating a stabilization of neural responses. This time
frame allows us to capture the immediate and most significant changes in brain activity in
response to the safety warnings.
4.1. Situational Awareness
To assess situational awareness after receiving the safety warnings, we utilized several key
neurological indicators: beta power, gamma power, theta-beta ratio, theta/(alpha+beta) ra-
tio, and (alpha+theta)/(alpha+beta) ratio. These metrics have been established as measures
of situational awareness in various cognitive tasks. Figures 5 and 6 presents our findings for
all these metrics across three warnings in two experimental conditions of low-intensity activ-
ity (LA) and moderate-intensity activity (MA). This visualization allows for a comparison
of how different neural metrics of situational awareness evolve in response to warnings under
different levels of physical engagement.
AsshowninFigures5and6, ouranalysisrevealsthefollowingpatternsacrossthemeasure
of situational awareness:
• Beta (β) and Gamma (γ) Power: Both LA and MA conditions showed an increase in β
and γ power immediately following each warning, indicating heightened alertness and
information processing. However, the increase was more pronounced in the LA condi-
tion, suggesting that lower physical engagement may allow for more robust situational
awareness responses. Moreover, as evidenced by the beta activity, the peak value of
average power in beta waves was observed within the first 125 milliseconds (ms) dur-
ing the LA. In contrast, during the MA, this peak consistently occurred between 125
to 250 ms for all three warnings. This temporal shift in peak beta activity suggests
a differential neural response pattern based on the level of physical engagement. The
earlier peak in the LA potentially reflects a greater readiness state in participants when
physical demands are lower.
16Figure 5: Comparison of Beta (β) and Gamma (γ) Waves in Light and Moderate Activity
• Theta-Beta Ratio (θ): This ratio indicates how much resting brainwave activity (theta)
β
one has versus active brainwave activity (beta). A higher ratio suggests more resting
activity, while a lower ratio indicates more active processing, often associated with
situational monitoring and cognitive control. This ratio showed a consistent decrease
across all warnings in both conditions, indicating higher situational awareness. The
decline was more rapid in the LA condition and was also consistent with the peaking
pattern of the beta power, where the peak for LA occurred earlier than MA.
• (Alpha+Theta)/(Alpha+Beta)Ratio(α+θ): Thismetric,linkedtothebalancebetween
α+β
relaxed awareness and active processing, demonstrated a sharp initial decrease followed
byagradualreturnto baseline. TheMA condition showeda more prolonged depression
of this ratio, and later peaking compared to LA.
• Theta/(Alpha+Beta)Ratio( θ ): Thisratio, indicativeofcognitiveworkloadinmain-
α+β
taining situational awareness, exhibited an initial decrease followed by a gradual return
to baseline in both conditions. The decrease was more pronounced in the LA condition,
possibly reflecting a more intense cognitive response to the warnings.
17Figure 6: Comparative Analysis of Combined EEG Ratio in Light and Moderate Activity
Across all metrics, we observed that the warnings effectively triggered neurological re-
sponses associated with situational awareness as soon as 125 ms after the delivery of the
warning. However, the peaking of situational awareness occurred earlier in the LA condition.
These findings support that varying levels of physical activity influence the neurological un-
18derpinnings of situational awareness in response to safety warnings. The results underscore
theimportanceofconsideringthephysicalcontextwhendesigningandimplementingwarning
systems to ensure optimal situational awareness across different activity levels.
4.2. Attention
To assess participants’ attention levels in response to safety warnings, we analyzed three
key neurological indicators: alpha waves in the back lobe, theta waves, and the alpha/beta
ratio(α). Thesemetricsarerecognizedas reliableindicatorsofattentionalprocesses. Figures
β
7 and 8 presents our findings for these attention-related metrics across three warnings in both
low-intensity activity (LA) and moderate-intensity activity (MA) conditions. As shown in
Figures 7 and 8, our analysis reveals the following patterns:
• Alpha (α) Power: We observed a consistent decrease in alpha power immediately fol-
lowingeachwarninginbothLAandMAconditions. Thisalphasuppressionistypically
associatedwithincreasedattentionandvisualprocessing. Interestingly, thesuppression
was more pronounced in the LA condition, suggesting that lower physical engagement
may allow for more robust attentional responses to stimuli.
• Theta (θ) Power: Theta power showed a decrease following each warning, particularly
in the frontal regions. A decrease in theta waves, particularly when accompanied by an
increase in beta waves, often suggests a shift from a relaxed state to a more attentive
and alert state. This decrease in theta could also suggest a shift from internal focus to
external, task-oriented attention. The peak value of θ activity in the frontal lobe was
observed within the first 125 milliseconds (ms) during the LA task. In contrast, in the
MA task, this peak occurred at varying intervals for each warning: within the first 125
ms for the first warning, between 125 to 250 ms for the second warning, and between
250 to 375 ms for the third warning.
• Alpha/Beta Ratio (α): This ratio, often used as an index of attentional control, demon-
β
strated a decrease following each warning in both conditions. However, the decrease
was more rapid and pronounced in the LA condition (as shown in Figure 8), suggest-
ing quicker attentional shifts. In the MA condition, the ratio showed a more gradual
decline and slower recovery, indicating a potentially more sustained but less intense
attentional response. The absolute peak value of the mean line of this indicator was
observed within the first 125 milliseconds (ms) during the LA task. In contrast, in the
MA task, this absolute peak occurred at varying intervals for each warning: within the
first 125 ms for the first warning, between 125 to 250 ms for the second warning, and
between 250 to 375 ms for the third warning and this trend is similar within the α
activity of the cerebral cortex.
19Figure 7: Comparison of Alpha (α) and Theta (θ) Waves in Light and Moderate Activity
Figure 8: Comparison of the Combined (α/β) Ratio in Light and Moderate Activity
Across all metrics, we observed that the timing of peak responses differed between con-
ditions. In the LA condition, peak attentional responses (as indicated by maximum alpha
20suppression and theta decrease) occurred within the first 125 milliseconds post-warning. In
contrast, these peaks were delayed to 125-250 ms in the MA condition. This temporal shift
aligns with our observations in the situational awareness metrics, further supporting the hy-
pothesis that increased physical activity may introduce a slight lag in cognitive responses to
external stimuli. The MA condition showed more gradual changes and longer recovery times
across all attention metrics compared to the LA condition.
4.3. Comparison of Subjective Cognitive Workload Measures and EEG Frequency Bands
Apart from the mental workload demands on workers during task execution, mental
workload also encompasses other components that contribute to the overall workload at the
job site. The results presented in Table 2 provide a comprehensive analysis of the correlation
between cognitive workload as subjectively measured by the NASA Task Load Index (NASA-
TLX) and brain frequency bands (alpha, beta, and theta) across different activity levels
while receiving safety warnings. Overall, the data reveals no consistent or strong correlations
between the subjective measures of cognitive workload and the EEG-based frequency band
data. The correlation coefficients vary widely across different dimensions of the NASA-TLX,
and activity levels (light and moderate).
For the Mental Demand dimension, correlation coefficients range from weak negative
to weak positive correlations across all frequency bands and warnings. Similar inconsis-
tent patterns are observed for Physical Demand, Temporal Demand, Performance, Effort,
and Frustration dimensions. Some isolated instances of moderate correlations are observed.
However, these isolated correlations do not form a consistent pattern across conditions or fre-
quency bands, suggesting they may be chance occurrences rather than indicative of a robust
relationship. The lack of significant and consistent correlations between subjective cogni-
tive workload measures and EEG frequency bands suggests that these two methods may be
capturing different aspects of cognitive workload.
Additionally, creating standard, generic indicators for certain construction activities is
difficult due to individual variations. These differences result in varied signal intensities and
patterns, even when performing the same task. The unique ways individuals perform tasks
lead to inconsistent data, making it challenging to develop uniform indicators.

214.4. Influence of Physical Activities and Warning Scenarios on Brain Waves
In our study, illustrated in Figure 9, we observed that beta waves, heightened beta waves
is linked to states of focused attention, problem-solving, and deep concentration, during
moderate tasks initially started at a lower level and increased at a slower rate compared
to light tasks. Specifically, this waves showed an increase from baseline to 125 milliseconds
post warning in light activity task, whereas this increase extended from baseline to 0 to 250
milliseconds post warning in moderate activity task. This finding suggests that participants
required more time for focused attention, problem-solving, and deep concentration during
moderate tasks. Additionally, since these two tasks are different, this discrepancy could be
due to the concept that attention involves the allocation of cognitive resources to specific
stimuli or tasks.
Figure9: Comparisonofwarningsthroughtheaveragepowerofallparticipantsinlightandmoderateactivity
In our study, we observed a decrease in alpha wave activity, as illustrated in Figure 9,
which corresponds to increased attentiveness. Alpha suppression is generally linked to en-
hanced attention and visual processing. However, our findings reveal no consistent trend in
alpha activity between light and moderate tasks after the warnings were issued. Notably,
across all three warning types, alpha wave activity in moderate tasks begins at a higher base-
line and decreases more gradually compared to light tasks. This desynchronization of alpha
waves, as previously established, reflects heightened cognitive engagement and attentiveness.
Another type of brain wave to consider is gamma waves. As shown in Table 1, gamma
waves are typically associated with working memory, situational awareness, and memory
processes. Highgammawaveactivityisalsocloselylinkedtomemoryprocesses. Ourfindings
align with these observations. As depicted in Figure 9, gamma wave activity increased
following the warnings for both light and moderate tasks. However, the intensity of gamma
waves varied across task activities. After the warnings, gamma waves began at a lower level
and rose more gradually during moderate tasks compared to light tasks. This difference may
be attributed to the higher cognitive load associated with moderate tasks. The increased
cognitive load could act as a barrier, reducing participants’ capacity for attention, working
memory, and memory processes.
22Theta waves are commonly associated with drowsiness or idle states in both children
and adults, and they are linked to short-term memory, making them a reliable indicator of
mental workload. Additionally, theta waves play a pivotal role in attention processing and
working memory. In this study, theta waves show a decreasing pattern in post warnings, as
shown in 9. Specifically, during moderate activity tasks, theta waves started at a higher level
and decreased at a slower rate compared to light activity tasks. This difference could be
due to the improvement in alertness and reduction in drowsiness after warnings. However,
the higher cognitive load and complexity of moderate tasks compared to light tasks likely
result in a slower reduction of theta waves, indicating that participants require more effort
to maintain focus and avoid drowsiness in more demanding tasks (Moderate Activity tasks).
5. Discussion
5.1. Relationship Between Reaction Time and EEG-based Cognitive Metrics in High and Low
Reaction Performers
Reaction time to warnings is one of the key indicator of situational awareness, reflecting
how quickly participants process and respond to stimuli. However, there is a gap in research
exploring the relationship between EEG-derived cognitive metrics and reaction times. In a
connected experiment conducted by the research team [5], reaction times were also recorded
for the same participants of this study as they responded to warnings in a VR environment.
We found that Participant 6 (P06), a 24-year-old male with 4 years of experience in con-
struction, displayed faster reaction times, potentially indicating higher cognitive efficiency.
In contrast, Participant 9 (P09), a 24-year-old male with 5 years of experience in construc-
tion, who exhibited consistently slower reaction times, may have struggled with maintaining
situational awareness and attention across varying task conditions. In the following, we will
explore the brain wave frequencies of the two participants, hereafter referred to as the high
performer (HP: P06) and the low performer (LP: P09), to investigate potential links between
their neural activity and reaction times.
In our experimental protocol, participants were subjected to three identical warnings, as
detailed in the method section. Analysis of the brain wave data revealed that participants
appeared to have adapted to the experimental environment by the second warning, evidenced
by the lack of significant difference in post-warning brain wave power patterns between the
second and third warnings. This observation aligns with established research on motor and
cognitive tasks [137, 138], which demonstrates that performance typically stabilizes following
an initial adaptation period. Given these findings, our subsequent discussion will focus on
the second warning, comparing the post-warning brain activities of the two high and low
performer participants. To facilitate the comparisons, we have visualized the brain activities
using heat maps for both participants during both light and moderate tasks for 500 ms post-
warnings. These heat maps provide a spatial representation of neural activity across different
brain regions.
5.1.1. α Band Activity
Figure 10 illustrates the alpha band activity of the high performer (HP: P06) and the low
performer (LP: P09) participants during light and moderate tasks, measured at different time
intervals following the warning. The figure highlights the distribution and power of alpha
23waves across various brain regions, where lower alpha power corresponds to higher attentive-
ness, and higher alpha power reflects reduced cognitive engagement. For HP, as shown in
Figure 10 (a), the baseline alpha activity is relatively low, suggesting a more attentive state
prior to receiving the warning. After the warning delivery, in the 0 to 125 ms post-warning
time window, alpha power decreases, indicating increased attentiveness immediately after the
warning. However, in the subsequent time windows (125 to 250 ms and beyond), alpha ac-
tivity increases, suggesting that attentiveness returns to approximately pre-warning baseline
status. In contrast, as shown Figure 10(c), LP shows consistently higher alpha power both at
baseline and throughout the post-warning intervals, suggesting lower attentiveness from the
start. In the early time window of 0 to 125 ms post-warning, alpha activity slightly decreases
but remains relatively high, particularly in the right temporal and occipital regions, reflect-
ing a slower or weaker response to the warning. As time progresses, during 125 to 250 ms,
alpha power increases further and becomes more widespread, extending across the central
and parietal regions, indicating that LP’s attentiveness continues to decline. LP’s pattern of
alpha power chanegs remains similar for the moderate activity with increase of alpha power
becoming more pornounced and encompassing the rnitire region at at 0-125 ms time window,
as shown in Figure 10(d).

Figure 10: α band activity of HP (P06) and LP (P09) during Light and Moderate Activity
These observations are connected to the reaction times of LP and HP, as LP’s higher
alpha power and reduced attentiveness likely contribute to slower reaction times, while HP’s
greater focus corresponds to faster, more responsive reactions to the warning. Additionally,
the effect of task intensity is evident in the faster onset of increased alpha power in the
moderate activity task compared to the light activity task.
5.1.2. θ Band Activity
IncomparingHPandLP’sthetaactivityfollowingthewarning, asshowninFigure11, HP
shows a reduction in theta activity during 125 ms post-warning performing the light activity
task. However, during the moderate task, HP reallocates cognitive resources, with increased
thetaactivityinthelefttemporalandfrontallobes—regionsassociatedwithworkingmemory
and cognitive control. At the same time, there is a decrease in theta activity in the right
occipital and parietal regions. This suggests that HP is concentrating cognitive resources
on areas critical for task engagement while reducing activity in less task-relevant regions,
24demonstrating a focused response to the increased task demands. In contrast, LP exhibits
a different pattern. During 125 ms post-warning performing the light activity task, there is
an increase in theta activity primarily in the right temporal, central, parietal, and occipital
regions. For the same time period, with increased task intensity in the moderate activity,
this theta activity becomes more widespread, with nearly the entire brain showing elevated
levels. This broader activation reflects LP’s heightened effort to stay cognitively engaged,
but the widespread increase may suggest a less efficient reallocation of cognitive resources
compared to HP. It appears that LP’s brain activate more uniformly across regions rather
than focusing on specific areas relevant to task performance.
Thesedifferencesinthetapatternsalignwiththereactiontimesofbothparticipants, with
HP’s more efficient theta activation leading to faster responses, whereas LP’s less focused
activity corresponds to slower reactions. In addition, the changes in theta activity for both
participantscorroboratewiththeiralphaactivitypatterns. Thisunderscorestherolesofboth
alpha and theta waves in cognitive processes related to task complexity and engagement,
aligning with the findings of Klimesch et al. [139].

5.1.3. β Band Activity
In comparing HP and LP’s beta activity following the warning, as shown in Figure 12, HP
shows an increased in beta activity during the interval 250 to 375 ms post-warning. However,
during the moderate task, HP reallocates cognitive resources, with increased beta activity in
the left temporal and frontal lobes during the interval 125 to 250 ms. This pattern indicates
that HP’s brain reallocates resources to manage the increased task demands, focusing more
on regions associated with situational awareness and cognitive control. The increased in beta
activity for HP may reflect a strategy of enhancing cognitive focus and reducing distractions
to effectively handle the more complex tasks. In contrast, as shown in Figure 12 (c) and (d),
LP exhibits a more pronounced reduction in beta activity during moderate tasks compared
to light tasks. In the light activity task, 125 ms post-warning, there is a decrease in beta
activity particularly in the temporal, central, and parietal regions, with the most redaction
occurring in the interval 125 to 250 ms. During the moderate activity, the entire brain shows
decreased beta activity, suggesting that the reduction in beta activity is associated with
decrease situational awareness and cognitive efficiency in response to the complexity of the
task. Since increase beta wave activity is associated with attention, situational awareness,
25problem-solving, and deep concentration, this pattern indicates that LP has a lower level of
attentiveness and SA compared to HP.
These differences in beta patterns align with the reaction times of both participants,
with HP’s more efficient beta activation leading to faster responses, whereas LP’s reduced
attentiveness and situational awareness results in slower reaction time.

In comparing HP and LP’s gamma activity following the warning, as shown in 13, HP a
significant increase in gamma activity during 125 ms post-warning of the light activity task.
However, during the medium activity, as shown in Figure 13 (b), there is a less pronounced
increased in gamma activity, particularly on the right side. This pattern indicates that HP’s
brain reallocates resources to cope with the increased task demands, focusing on regions
associated with attention and cognitive control. The reduction in gamma activity during
medium tasks may also reflect a decrease in situational awareness as the task complexity
increases. In contrast, as shown in Figure 13 (c) and (d), LP exhibits increase in gamma
activity sooner during light tasks compared to medium tasks. In the light activity task,
during 125 ms post-warning, there is an improvement in gamma activity particularly in
the temporal and partial frontal regions. However, during the medium activity, the entire
brain shows decreased gamma activity, suggesting that the reduction in gamma activity is
associated with the cognitive load and increased task complexity. However, between 125 ms
and 250 ms post-warning there is a slight improvement in the right side of the brain.
These differences in gamma patterns align with the reaction times of both participants,

5.2. Neuro-physiological Sensing for Enhanced Work Zone Safety
Our study’s use of EEG technology to assess neurophysiological responses to AR-based
safety warnings represents a significant advancement in work zone safety research. Tradi-
tional safety measures often focus on physical hazards, neglecting the cognitive states of
workers that are crucial for maintaining situational awareness and preventing accidents. Our
findings demonstrate the feasibility and value of using EEG to objectively measure these cog-
nitive states. The EEG data collected during our simulations revealed significant changes in
brain activity patterns in response to AR multi-sensory warnings. Specifically, we observed
increased activity in regions associated with attention and situational awareness when partic-
ipants were exposed to these warnings. This aligns with previous research by Ramos-Hurtado
et al. [25] and Lukosch et al. [26], who found that AR can improve workers’ understanding
of safety risks. However, our study extends these findings by providing objective, neurophys-
iological evidence of enhanced cognitive processes. Importantly, our results also highlighted
the impact of workload on the effectiveness of AR warnings. Under high physical workload
conditions, the EEG data showed a diminished response to AR warnings, suggesting that
cognitive resources may be diverted from processing these alerts when workers are physically
strained. This finding supports the work of Kim et al. [14] and Zhang et al. [15], who noted
the influence of physical workload on situational awareness. Our study, however, provides
more nuanced insights into this relationship in the context of AR-assisted work zones.
The discrepancies we observed between subjective assessments of situational awareness
andobjectiveEEG-basedmetricsunderscoretheimportanceofusingneurophysiologicalmea-

with AR warnings, the EEG data revealed more variability, particularly under high workload
conditions. This highlights a potential limitation of relying solely on self-reported measures
and emphasizes the value of objective neurophysiological monitoring.
Furthermore,ourresearchopensupnewpossibilitiesforcontinuousmonitoringofworkers’
cognitive states in real-world work zones. While our study was conducted in a simulated
environment, the methodology we developed could be adapted for field use. This could
involve the development of wearable EEG devices integrated into safety equipment, such as
hard hats. Such a system could provide real-time alerts to workers and supervisors when
cognitive states indicative of reduced situational awareness or increased accident risk are
detected.
27Moreover, the use of such advanced safety technology could have insurance implications.
By demonstrating a commitment to proactive safety measures and reducing the risk of ac-
cidents, construction companies could potentially negotiate lower insurance premiums. The
continuous data collection and analysis could provide tangible evidence of improved safety
practicesandreducedincidentrates, makingacompellingcaseforinsuranceproviderstooffer
more favorable terms. This not only benefits the companies financially but also underscores
the value of investing in innovative safety solutions to protect workers.
5.3. Implications for Workforce Training and Task Matching
The observed variability in EEG responses to AR warnings under different workload con-
ditions suggests that workers may benefit from personalized training programs. By utilizing
a combination of AR and EEG technologies in a Virtual Reality training environment, more
effective and targeted training scenarios could be created. These scenarios could be designed
to replicate the cognitive demands of actual work zones, allowing workers to develop and re-
fine their situational awareness skills in a safe, controlled setting. This approach aligns with
the findings of Paes et al. [140], who demonstrated the importance of using AR technology
for safety training.
OurEEGdatarevealedthatsomeparticipantsmaintainedhighlevelsofsituationalaware-
ness even under high workload conditions, while others showed significant decreases. This
variability indicates that individual differences play an important role in how workers re-
spond to AR safety systems. By incorporating EEG monitoring into VR training sessions,
it would be possible to identify workers who may need additional support or training, in-
cluding indivduals with disabilities, to maintain optimal situational awareness in challenging
conditions.
Furthermore, the EEG data collected during our study provides insights into the cogni-
tive load experienced by workers when processing AR warnings. This information could be
valuable for task matching within work zones. For instance, workers who demonstrate a high
capacity for processing multiple sensory inputs while maintaining low cognitive load might be
better suited for roles that require constant interaction with AR safety systems. Conversely,
those who show increased cognitive load with AR warnings might be more effective in roles
with less reliance on these systems.
Additionally, this approach holds promise for workers with disabilities. By quantifying
their cognitive measures through continuous EEG monitoring, it is possible to identify the
most suitable tasks for these individuals. Tailoring task assignments based on cognitive
strengths allows workers with disabilities to become more active and integrated within the
workforce. This not only enhances their productivity and job satisfaction but also fosters an
inclusive work environment.
6. Conclusion
This study aimed to assess situational awareness, attention, and cognitive workload ex-
perienced by construction workers receiving safety warnings in roadway work zones. By
leveraging EEG sensing technology within a high-fidelity virtual reality environment, we
have gained valuable insights into the neurological responses of workers to multi-sensory
warnings during light and moderate-intensity tasks. Our findings reveal distinct patterns in
28brain activity across different task intensities and in response to warnings. Situational aware-
ness indicators, including beta and gamma waves, demonstrated increases post-warning, with
varying intensities between task types. Furthermore, attention indicators such as alpha and
theta waves showed a consistent decrease following warnings, with moderate-intensity tasks
exhibiting higher initial levels and slower rates of decrease. Analyzing the correlation be-
tween brain activity bands (alpha, beta, and gamma) and NASA-TLX factors, we found no
consistent pattern in the direction of correlation across different warnings and tasks.
The human-sensing model developed in this study represents a significant advancement
in the field. By incorporating brain frequency band characteristics, it offers a more nu-
anced understanding of workers’ cognitive states during AR-enabled warning reception. This
model not only enhances our ability to assess situational awareness, attention, and cogni-
tive workload but also clarifies the relationship between these factors and physical effort.
This research contributes to the growing body of knowledge on construction worker safety,
particularly in high-risk environments such as roadway work zones. By deepening our under-
standing of workers’ cognitive responses to warnings and task intensities, we pave the way
for more effective, personalized safety measures. As we continue to advance in this field, the
ultimate goal remains clear: to significantly reduce accidents and fatalities in construction
work zones through evidence-based, neurologically-informed safety practices and technology
development.
We acknowledge a few limitations of this study that should be addressed in future re-
search. The study was conducted in a simulated virtual reality environment, which, while
allowing for controlled low-risk experimentation, may not fully capture the complexity and
unpredictability of real-world work zones. Furthermore, our study focused primarily on im-
mediate cognitive responses to AR warnings, and did not assess the long-term effects of using
such safety systems. Future research should consider longitudinal studies to evaluate how
workers’ responses and performance may change over extended periods of AR system use.
Moreover, while we examined different workload conditions, our experimental design may
not have captured the full range of physical and cognitive demands experienced by workers.
Finally, our study was limited in its exploration of individual differences. Factors such as age,
prior experience with AR technologies, disabilities, or cognitive styles could influence how
workers respond to AR warnings. Future studies should aim to investigate these individual
differencestoprovideanunderstandingofAReffectivenessacrossdiverseworkerpopulations.
