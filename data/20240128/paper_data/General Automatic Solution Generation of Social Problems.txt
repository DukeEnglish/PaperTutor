Abstract: Given the escalating intricacy and multifaceted nature of contemporary social systems, manually generating
solutions to address pertinent social issues has become a formidable task. In response to this challenge, the rapid development
of artificial intelligence has spurred the exploration of computational methodologies aimed at automatically generating
solutions. However, current methods for auto-generation of solutions mainly concentrate on local social regulations that pertain
to specific scenarios. Here, we report an automatic social operating system (ASOS) designed for general social solution
generation, which is built upon agent-based models, enabling both global and local analyses and regulations of social problems
across spatial and temporal dimensions. ASOS adopts a hypergraph with extensible social semantics for a comprehensive and
structured representation of social dynamics. It also incorporates a generalized protocol for standardized hypergraph operations
and a symbolic hybrid framework that delivers interpretable solutions, yielding a balance between regulatory efficacy and
function viability. To demonstrate the effectiveness of ASOS, we apply it to the domain of averting extreme events within
international oil futures markets. By generating a new trading role supplemented by new mechanisms, ASOS can adeptly
discern precarious market conditions and make front-running interventions for non-profit purposes. This study demonstrates
that ASOS provides an efficient and systematic approach for generating solutions for enhancing our society.

perceives not only its own conditions, but also the
international factors, and the time-to-time information of the
futures market.
Apart from agents, the market is designed to conform to
primary real market regulations: “Order”, “Trading” and
“Clearance and settlement”.
Order. ICOFM provides two order types: limit order (LMT)
and market order (MKT). Each order is required to specify
four items:
(𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡 𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑡ℎ,𝑝𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒,𝑞𝑢𝑎𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑡𝑦,𝑠𝑖𝑑𝑒)
{ } (4)
|𝑠𝑖𝑑𝑒∈{𝑎𝑠𝑘,𝑏𝑖𝑑}
while the MKT does not need to indicate the price. Besides,
ICOFM maintains an orderbook with two charts. The first
chart represents the outstanding orders, which are sorted by
order prices. For simplicity, quantities of contracts in buy
orders are recorded as negative values, and quantities of
contracts in sell orders are positive. The second chart
represents the latest transactions.
Trading. According to the commodity futures trading rules,
ICOFM contains two trading stages. Before opening the
market on each trading day, the market implements the call
auction. It is forbidden to submit MKT in the call auction
stage. At this stage, the oil prices are set based on maximum
trading volume, which will also become the opening price.
The outstanding orders will be held until the market opens.
After opening, the market implements the continuous double
auction. At this stage, a transaction occurs if there is an
outstanding order on the other side of the orderbook at a
price equal to or better than the price of the submitted order.
If not, the submitted order will be added to the orderbook.
When multiple outstanding orders are eligible for trading, Fig. 4 The schematic of ICOFM. The above part is the ICOFM’s

ASOS first automatically regulates the global structure and
local details of the ICOFM hypergraph to enhance the
credibility of future solutions, which can be referred to as
social phenomena reproduction. From the global perspective,
ASOS evaluates the contributions of different international
factors to the fluctuation of the oil futures price. This is

for preventing market collapse through the CGP

mechanism involves closing the market when the fluctuation

order type (only allows “market orders” involve trading). Fig.

evolution progress for generating solutions, which includes
several intermediate generated solutions and their
performance rewards on both decreasing fluctuations and
encouraging the dealing amount.
There are three criteria to evaluate the proposed solutions.
The first criterion determines the solution’s effectiveness of
achieving the objective. Specifically, we use Bollinger bands
to indicate the fluctuation of oil price as follows. The
Bollinger bands consist of an upper band, a lower band with
a moving average curve between them. Considering a

used to determine if the incoming new order will cause the live-time price to exceed the fluctuation range. If so, IM1 and IM2 will generate priority
orders, whose quantity is the sum of waiting orders that are able to be delt by the incoming new orders (realized by operator Sum3), and price is the
