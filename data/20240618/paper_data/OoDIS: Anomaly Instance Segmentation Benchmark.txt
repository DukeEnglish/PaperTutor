Abstract
Autonomousvehiclesrequireapreciseunderstandingof
theirenvironmenttonavigatesafely. Reliableidentification
of unknown objects, especially those that are absent dur-
ing training, such as wild animals, is critical due to their
potential to cause serious accidents. Significant progress
in semantic segmentation of anomalies has been driven by
the availability of out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks.
However,acomprehensiveunderstandingofscenedynam-
ics requires the segmentation of individual objects, and
thus the segmentation of instances is essential. Devel-
opment in this area has been lagging, largely due to the
lack of dedicated benchmarks. To address this gap, we

we observed an unexpectedly poor performance of VOS.
While performing well on ambiguous objects, i.e. the toy
car is correctly predicted as an anomaly, vos struggles to
predict for an unknown object (see Figure 4). Note that,
we have not contacted the authors of VOS for help with
