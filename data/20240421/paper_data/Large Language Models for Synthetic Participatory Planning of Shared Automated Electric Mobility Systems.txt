Abstract
Unleashing the synergies of rapidly evolving mobility technologies in a multi-stakeholder
landscape presents unique challenges and opportunities for addressing urban transportation
problems. This paper introduces a novel synthetic participatory method, critically leveraging
large language models (LLMs) to create digital avatars representing diverse stakeholders to
plan shared automated electric mobility systems (SAEMS). These calibratable agents
collaboratively identify objectives, envision and evaluate SAEMS alternatives, and strategize
implementation under risks and constraints. The results of a Montreal case study indicate that
a structured and parameterized workflow provides outputs with high controllability and
comprehensiveness on an SAEMS plan than generated using a single LLM-enabled expert
agent. Consequently, the approach provides a promising avenue for cost-efficiently improving
the inclusivity and interpretability of multi-objective transportation planning, suggesting a
paradigm shift in how we envision and strategize for sustainable and equitable transportation
systems.

1. Introduction
Mobility systems worldwide, at a pivotal crossroads, confront escalating challenges—
aging infrastructure, increasing environmental impacts from transportation emissions, and
widening service provision gaps that exacerbate social inequalities. These challenges demand
resilient and adaptive planning strategies that effectively leverage both existing and emerging
technologies—including autonomous driving, vehicle electrification, advanced
communication, and Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) platforms. Shared Automated Electric
Mobility Systems (SAEMS), exemplified by on-demand autonomous electric bikeshare
systems, autonomous transit and passenger car services, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
delivery services, present viable solutions to these pressing issues.
However, the potential of SAEMS to benefit diverse populations often remains
underrealized amid climatic, technological, and socioeconomic uncertainties. This shortfall
largely stems from the complexity of integrating a broad spectrum of domain knowledge and
perspectives—ranging from charging systems engineering to urban policies, and from local
business operations to residents’ daily experiences—into coherent planning processes.
Therefore, an inclusive and anticipatory planning framework is crucial. It must be capable of
synthesizing diverse technical and non-technical stakeholder inputs to ensure the
comprehensiveness and inclusiveness of any proposed SAEMS to ensure that these systems
evolve in a manner that is equitable and aligned with broader societal goals.
Traditional participatory planning, while valuable, often faces various barriers that limit
its effectiveness and inclusivity, including the logistical and administrative challenges of
coordinating meetings, the financial and organizational obstacles of providing adequate
incentives for participation, and difficulty of reaching consensus (Gosling, 2018). Longer
participatory sessions can also lead to participant fatigue, resulting in lower-quality outcomes,
1and participants may churn or be unable to participate continuously due to other life
commitments.
This paper proposes a novel synthetic participatory approach that utilizes generative
artificial intelligence to create digital avatars representing diverse stakeholder groups. These
avatars, powered by multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) (Wang et al., 2024),
participate in virtual deliberations, enhancing the planning process's inclusivity, efficiency,
and adaptability. This method not only streamlines stakeholder engagement but also integrates
diverse perspectives more effectively than traditional methods. Specifically, the synthetic
participatory approach offers several benefits, including lower costs, consistency, and the
ability to run simulations as many times as needed, testing different formats. We deploy our
methods on city of Montreal, and the results show that our methods outperform human experts
in satisfying residents’ needs as well as service accessibility and ecology metrics. The method
is expected to facilitate initial phase of a participatory planning process by foreseeing and
preparing for potential scenarios, but it is also expected to gradually become part of the official
planning process through direct interactions between real human stakeholders and digital
representatives of themselves or of other stakeholders when they have other commitments.
The proposed method simulates the whole process of transportation planning, ranging
from identifying issues and objectives to ideation and evaluation of alternatives. The method
can generate comprehensive transportation plans with controllable and interpretable
parameters. Each agent can represent a specific aspect of real life, such as personality,
socioeconomic background, or health condition, with controllable parameters. These
calibratable agents in a virtual participatory process identify objectives, conceive future
SAEMS, and strategize implementation with each other, and potentially with real human
stakeholders as an instantiation of human-machine collaborative decision-making. This
prospect leverages the strengths of both human intelligence and artificial intelligence to
develop, test, and refine infrastructure improvements in a simulated, risk-free environment.
The synthetic human-machine teaming framework is illustrated in Figure 1, showing how data
from various sources are utilized to evaluate safety improvement alternatives in a simulation
testbed. The synthetic human-AI team provides a novel information architecture, distributing
knowledge across a flexible network of AI agents. This approach not only enhances the
planning process but also contributes to the development of interpretable and explainable AI.
Furthermore, it is perhaps the first time to provide a mathematical description of a prompting
framework for expert system development.

transportation systems. Section 3 details the methodology, focusing on the architecture and

approach for SAEMS planning. Section 6 delves into the broader challenges and future

participatory methods, especially focusing on literature related to Montreal. Section 7

future research and practice in the field of SAEMS planning and synthetic participatory
decision-making.
2. Literature Review
2.1 Technological Foundation and Planning of SAEMS
The transition towards sustainable urban mobility is increasingly characterized by
automation, electrification, and advanced communication technologies. The convergence of
these technologies aims to address challenges such as high human labor costs, low transport
capacity utilization, and high emissions. Javed et al. (2022) underscore the transformative
potential of such systems within the context of smart cities, highlighting the need for a holistic
approach to urban mobility that leverages automation, connectivity, and electrification
paradigms.
3Automation plays a crucial role in SAEMS, particularly through the development of
autonomous vehicles (AVs). The integration of AVs into shared mobility services promises to
enhance efficiency, reduce human error, and improve accessibility. Planning for AV
infrastructure (e.g., dedicated AV corridors and zones), as identified by Gomes Correia &
Ferreira (2023), is critical to introduce and accommodate AV operations, covering areas such
as physical infrastructure, communication systems, policies, and regulations. Yu & Chen (2021)
suggest the importance of differentiating the installation rate and the usage rate when
projecting the on-road AVs and empahsize the endogenous impact of AV infrastructures and
traffic regulations on AV adoptions.
Electrification is a cornerstone of SAEMS, with studies like (Azin et al., 2021; Wang et
al., 2023, 2024) emphasizing the need for charging infrastructure and subsidy policies to
support the adoption of electric mobility. Huang et al. (2022) explore the joint planning of
charging infrastructure and autonomous fleets, considering distributed renewable resources,
underscoring the complexity of electrification planning in the context of SAEMS.
The planning and optimization of shared mobility systems are explored by (Chen & Liu,
2023), highlighting the integration of fleet management, charging infrastructure, and user
demand. When the shared systems are on-demand or demand-responsive (rather than
reservation-based), managing curb usage (e.g., static and dynamic pick-up and drop-off
locations) and depot siting and capacity planning are critical (Yu & Hyland, 2023). (Vosooghi
et al., 2020) assess the impact of charging infrastructure on the performance of shared
autonomous electric vehicle services, providing insights into the operational considerations of
shared mobility.
Sheppard et al. (2019) present a joint optimization scheme for the planning and operations
of shared autonomous electric vehicle (SAEV) fleets serving mobility on demand. Their
research highlights the importance of integrating fleet management, charging infrastructure,
and user demand to optimize the performance of SAEVs. This approach aligns with the
multidisciplinary challenges in SAEMS planning, emphasizing the need for a unified
methodology that considers operational and infrastructural aspects of shared mobility services.
Miao et al. (2019) identify the need for a comprehensive system design approach that
incorporates new emerging features of autonomous connected electric vehicle-based car-
sharing system and addresses the limitations of conventional car-sharing policies and electric
vehicle technologies, such as costly vehicle relocation, restricted vehicle range, and lengthy
recharge times. Dean et al. (2022) highlight the potential synergy from careful coordination
between charging activities and repositioning activities of operating SAEVs for reducing rider
wait time, empty travel distance, and non-revenue operation time. Paudel & Das (2023) focus
on infrastructure planning for ride-hailing services using SAEVs, indicating the potential for
participatory methods to address strategic planning challenges.
Despite the emphasis on technical aspects of SAEMS planning, there is a notable gap in
integrating social considerations, particularly through participatory approaches. The
integration of ACES components within SAEMS underscores the complexity of urban
transportation planning in the era of rapid technological change. A balanced approach that
addresses both the technical and social dimensions of planning is essential for creating
sustainable, efficient, and inclusive urban mobility solutions. Future research should continue
to bridge the gap between technical planning and social considerations, ensuring that SAEMS
are developed and implemented in a manner that meets the diverse needs of urban communities.
2.2 Participatory Planning
Participatory approaches in transportation planning are increasingly recognized for their
ability to engage diverse stakeholders in the decision-making process, leading to more
inclusive and sustainable urban mobility solutions. This section reviews recent literature on
4participatory methods, highlighting their relevance in various contexts and the challenges they
address.
Becu et al. (2008) examine the potential of participatory processes for collective decision-
making through the (computer simulation-aided) Companion Modeling (ComMod) approach.
Applied to a watershed conflict in northern Thailand, their study highlights the challenges of
making stakeholders understand the model as a representation of reality and the concept of
scenarios as hypothetical situations. The research emphasizes the importance of stakeholder
involvement in assessing model assumptions, interpreting simulation results, and suggesting
scenarios for conflict resolution. Tatum et al. (2020) detail the Altona Mobility Lab, part of
the "Cities-4-People" project funded by Horizon 2020, which implements locally developed
mobility solutions through a co-creative approach. The lab serves as a model for urban living
labs, demonstrating the process of community building, ideation, and implementation of user-
centric mobility solutions. The analysis of this project offers insights into the potential
successes and challenges of the Living Lab method for participatory development of
sustainable mobility solutions. Acheampong et al. (2023) explore the use of participatory
multi-criteria visioning and appraisal framework in the UK and Australia to envision and
evaluate autonomous vehicle (AV) futures. Their study reveals stakeholders' mixed attitudes
towards AVs and emphasizes the importance of governance in mediating the politics of AV
implementation. This research underscores the critical role of participatory approaches in
reconciling divergent values and competing visions in urban transport planning, especially
concerning disruptive technologies like AVs.
In the context of Montreal, Boisjoly & Yengoh (2017a) investigate the barriers and
opportunities of local participatory approaches in transportation planning. They highlight the
need for clear social equity goals and skilled facilitation to support the integration of diverse
perspectives. This study demonstrates the potential of Local Transportation Plans (LTPs) to
address transport-related social aspects, provided that the process is inclusive and well-
supported. Fouracre et al. (2006) argue for a more participatory approach to transport planning
in developing countries, emphasizing the importance of understanding household activity
patterns and the implications of travel on livelihoods. Their case studies in Harare, Accra, and
Colombo illustrate how participatory methods can better support the needs of low-income
populations and contribute to poverty alleviation objectives. Wang & Noe (2010) review
knowledge sharing research, emphasizing the importance of organizational, interpersonal,
team, cultural, and motivational factors in facilitating knowledge sharing. Their findings have
implications for participatory planning in transportation, where knowledge sharing among
stakeholders is crucial for effective decision-making.
Nalmpantis et al. (2019) evaluate innovative ideas for public transport proposed by
citizens using Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA). In their study, the Analytic
Hierarchy Process method ranks ideas based on feasibility, utility, and innovativeness. The
results highlight the importance of citizen participation in generating and prioritizing
innovative solutions for public transport, demonstrating the value of participatory techniques
in enhancing the attractiveness of public transport systems. Campisi et al. (2020) explore
public opinion on personal mobility vehicle use in Palermo, Italy. Their study underscores the
significance of participatory planning processes in understanding and addressing the real
needs of road users, emphasizing the role of sociodemographic characteristics in shaping
public opinion and transport planning. Schröder et al. (2019) advocate for a transdisciplinary
research and stakeholder engagement framework to address consumption-based emissions and
impacts in cities. They emphasize the need for inclusive participation in sustainable
consumption and production (SCP) initiatives, highlighting the potential for reducing cities'
environmental footprints through combined production and consumption-based approaches.
The Delphi technique, as discussed by Kezar & Maxey (2016) and Melander (2018), offers a
5structured approach to participatory research. Kezar & Maxey (2016) propose a change-oriented
Delphi to create solutions for challenges in higher education, while Melander (2018) reflects
on the method's application in transport scenario studies. Merfeld et al. (2019) conduct a four-
stage Delphi study to uncover drivers, barriers, and future developments in carsharing with
shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs). Their findings emphasize technological aspects,
consumer acceptance, and legislative concerns, pointing out the secondary perception of
sustainability and ethics in the context of SAVs. Schmalz et al. (2021) share lessons learned
from a two-round Delphi-based scenario study, providing valuable insights for researchers
applying the Delphi technique to prospective questions and other research settings. Their study
highlights the importance of planning an appropriate period for distributing questionnaires and
the potential of projections that create dissent among panelists. Beiderbeck et al. (2021)
present technical recommendations derived from a Delphi study that was conducted amid the
outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. These studies highlight the Delphi method's
potential in exploring divergent ideas about the future and its adaptability to various research
settings. The literature on participatory approaches in transportation planning underscores the
importance of engaging diverse stakeholders, the potential of structured methods like the
Delphi technique, and the need to address challenges related to governance, social equity, and
technological uncertainties. These studies collectively demonstrate the value of participatory
methods in developing more inclusive and sustainable urban mobility solutions.
2.3 Human-AI Collaborative Decision-Making and Potential LLM
Enhancement
Human-AI collaboration leverages the combined strengths of human intuition and AI's
computational power to enhance the design and operational efficiencies of complex
sociotechnical systems. Studies such as those by Yin et al. (2015) and Gall et al. (2021)
underscore the importance of integrating human cognitive processes with AI systems,
proposing a collaborative framework where humans and machines work together and learn
from each other. This approach is essential for automating design tasks and fostering an
upward-spiral cognitive process in decision-making. Reisenbichler et al. (2022) amphasize the
need for human-centered AI in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry,
advocating for AI systems that understand and utilize human input to amplify human abilities
and reflect realistic conceptions. They highlight the importance of integrating natural language
processing and machine reading comprehension to create environments that satisfy human
preferences and enhance collaboration, safety, and project management in the AEC sector. In
the realm of freight infrastructure planning, Yu et al. (2021) demonstrate how machine
learning algorithms, when paired with human expertise, can effectively analyze and interpret
large datasets, such as truck parking behaviors. This collaboration not only improves the
decision-making process but also ensures that outcomes are practical and closely aligned with
stakeholder needs. Furthermore, (Zhang et al., 2022) explore the concept of integrated human-
machine intelligence (IHMI) in civil engineering, discussing the fusion of AI’s efficiency with
human adaptability to advance decision-making in civil engineering projects in business-as-
usual and emergent situations. They call for future studies to explore the value, methods, and
challenges of applying IHMI in civil engineering, identifying knowledge gaps that need
addressing to maximize the benefits of this integration. These insights showcase the versatile
benefits of human-AI collaboration in managing and solving complex challenges in
sociotechnical systems across various sectors, emphasizing the need for technologies that
enhance human capabilities and respect human input.
LLM role playing represents a cutting-edge application of Large Language Models
(LLMs) that extends beyond traditional uses, venturing into dynamic simulations of human-
like behaviors and decision-making processes. This approach leverages the advanced
capabilities of LLMs to create interactive scenarios where artificial agents simulate complex
6social interactions and cognitive behaviors. Ghaffarzadegan et al. (2024) explore the
integration of LLMs in generative agent-based modeling, which is instrumental in mimicking
human decision-making within diverse social systems. This methodology allows for the
simulation of nuanced human interactions, providing insights into how individuals and groups
might respond to various stimuli or changes within their environment. Such models are
particularly valuable in scenarios where understanding human behavior dynamics is crucial
for the development of effective strategies and interventions. (Shanahan et al., 2023) discuss
the risks associated with anthropomorphism in LLM role playing, emphasizing the necessity
of maintaining clear boundaries between human-like and machine-driven behaviors. They
argue for the importance of ensuring that the outputs and actions of LLMs are strictly
interpretable and aligned with their intended applications, avoiding misrepresentations that
could lead to incorrect or unethical uses of the technology. Park et al. (2023) introduce the
concept of generative agents that simulate human behavior within interactive environments.
These agents are designed to perform daily activities, engage in social interactions, and
respond to environmental cues, much like humans do. This level of simulation can be used in
various applications, from virtual reality and gaming environments to more serious uses such
as training programs for social skills, emergency response drills, or even urban planning. LLM
role playing is an innovative field that offers significant potential across various domains;
however, as this technology progresses, it is crucial to address ethical considerations and
ensure the accuracy and appropriateness of the simulations to avoid potential misuses and
societal harm.
The application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in role-playing scenarios within
transportation systems planning presents several challenges and opportunities, particularly
around elicitation, calibration, and validation of the models. Achieving accurate alignment of
LLM outputs with real-world data and user preferences is crucial for their effective application
in decision-making processes. Incorporating these advanced methodologies and frameworks
offers substantial opportunities for enhancing decision-making in transportation planning.
However, it is crucial to address the challenges associated with the calibration and validation
of LLMs to ensure their outputs are reliable and relevant.
3. Methodology
This section first introduces a synthetic participatory planning framework that integrates
generative AI, particularly LLMs, for conceiving and planning SAEMS in the context of
overall urban systems. The framework is grounded in the principles of participatory modeling
and decision-making, the capabilities of generative AI for simulating complex human
interactions, and the domain knowledge of transportation systems engineering and planning.
We then present the workflow for utilizing such a framework in Section 3.2-3.5.
3.1 Framework
The proposed decision support system consists of three main components: a set of digital
avatars representing stakeholders that form a synthetic team, a multimodal LLM for generating
and processing natural language interactions, and a computational and data storage platform
that enable participatory modeling and evaluates design and planning alternatives. As
illustrated in Figure 1, the digital avatars mimic human stakeholders, such as residents,
policymakers, and technical experts, enabling their participation in the planning process in
simulation. The LLM enables the intelligence of the digital representatives of these
stakeholders and simulate their activities and interactions to identify problems and solution
alternatives, and then collaboratively develop models and evaluate these alternatives. Figure
2 shows the procedure of how decision support system functions -- the three components
interact in an iterative, three-step workflow. In the following subsections, we will present the
details in each step.
7Figure 2. Synthetic participatory planning process of future mobility systems
3.2 Forming Synthetic Team
The workflow begins with collecting information from key stakeholders, which enables
the creation of their digital avatars (representatives). The elicitation methods can be a
combination of surveys, interviews, revealed preferences, observed behaviors, and biometric
measurement. When conditions allow, we can even directly analyze the participatory
procedures. The information can then be used generate digital avatars of the participants. In
later steps, these avatars will engage in simulated participatory processes for identifying urban
problems and objectives and for envisioning and planning future mobility systems; therefore,
the training, validation, and testing of these avatars are crucial for ensuring their accuracy and
reliability in representing stakeholder preferences.
The elicitation process involves obtaining responses and observations from 𝑆
stakeholders regarding their background, socioeconomic conditions, temperament, health
conditions, and their views on identified problems, objectives, and performance metrics of
SAEMS planning. This can be generally represented as a function:
𝑄:Ψ → ℛ (1)
where 𝑄 represents the measurement that maps a given mental state 𝜓 ∈ Ψ to a response 𝑟 ∈
(cid:3046)
ℛ. 𝒮 is the set of 𝑆 stakeholders, with their corresponding mental states stored in a set 𝜓 =
[𝜓 ,𝜓 ,…,𝜓 …,𝜓 ],∀𝑠 ∈ 𝒮 and 𝑆 = dim (𝜓). 𝜓 is a state vector (abstract construct) that
(cid:2869) (cid:2870) (cid:3046) (cid:3020) (cid:3046)
stores all the information needed for the functional mapping of 𝑄. A set of 𝑄 ∈𝒬(cid:3047)(cid:3045)(cid:3028)(cid:3036)(cid:3041)
produces all the necessary responses for (digitally) reconstructing the person in LLM (at least
for the present planning purpose). From the perspective of the proposed synthetic approach,
these attributes of a stakeholder become the parameters to be estimated. Note that, once we
impose 𝑄 on 𝜓 (or measure 𝜓 with the operator 𝑄), 𝜓 might alter. We can denote the
(cid:3046) (cid:3046) (cid:3046)
change of 𝜓 (i.e., 𝜓̇) as an operator 𝐻 on 𝜓, or simply 𝜓̇ = 𝐻(𝜓), where 𝐻 describes how 𝜓
evolves. It is challenging to parameterize the conversion influence. But Yu and Jayakrishnan
(2018) proposed a quantum cognition approach.
8Suppose that all the information we need about a stakeholder 𝑠 is in 𝜓 , so the resultant
(cid:3046)
responses is in 𝑟 = [𝑟(cid:2869),𝑟(cid:2870),…𝑟(cid:3041),…,𝑟(cid:3015)](cid:3021), where 𝑟(cid:3041) is the 𝑛th response to 𝑄(cid:3041) ∈ 𝒬(cid:3047)(cid:3045)(cid:3028)(cid:3036)(cid:3041), 𝑁 =
(cid:3046) (cid:3046) (cid:3046) (cid:3046) (cid:3046)
𝑐𝑎𝑟𝑑(cid:3435)𝒬(cid:3047)(cid:3045)(cid:3028)(cid:3036)(cid:3041)(cid:3439). The expected response to a 𝑄 should approximate the observed response. That
is, a new question 𝑄′ on the synthetic agent will produce a response similar to 𝑟(cid:3041).
(cid:3046)
𝑟(cid:3041) ← 𝔼(ℒℳ(𝑄(cid:4593)|𝑦 )) (2)
(cid:3046) (cid:2869)
where 𝑄′∈ 𝒬(cid:3047)(cid:3045)(cid:3028)(cid:3036)(cid:3041).
To ensure the reliability and validity of the data collected, the training process involves
fine-tuning the prompt of LLM to accurately predict the response to any relevant 𝑄 ∈ 𝒬(cid:3047)(cid:3045)(cid:3028)(cid:3036)(cid:3041).
Let a function 𝑓 maps a response (a string) to a feature vector 𝜇 . The distance between the
(cid:3046)
meaning of an actual response and a predicted response can then be measured as.
𝜇̂(cid:4593) ∙𝜇
𝒥(𝑓(𝑟(cid:3041)),𝑓(𝔼(ℒℳ(𝑄(cid:4593)|𝑦 )))) = (cid:3046) (cid:3046) (3)
(cid:3046) (cid:2869) ‖𝜇̂(cid:4593)‖‖𝜇 ‖
(cid:3046) (cid:3046)
where 𝜇̂(cid:4593) is the predicted feature vector and ‖∙‖ is the Euclidean norm.
(cid:3046)
The calibration process involves optimizing the parameters 𝜃 of the avatar model to
minimize the difference between the avatars’ responses and the actual responses of the
professionals for the training set (for 𝑄 ∈𝒬(cid:3047)(cid:3045)(cid:3028)(cid:3036)(cid:3041)), the validation set (for 𝑄(cid:4593) ∈𝒬(cid:3047)(cid:3045)(cid:3028)(cid:3036)(cid:3041),𝑄(cid:4593) ≠𝑄),
and the test set (for 𝑄(cid:4593)(cid:4593) ∈ 𝒬(cid:3047)(cid:3032)(cid:3046)(cid:3047)). This estimation can be expressed as an optimization problem
that minimizes the loss function such as the following:
min 𝒯 = (cid:4699)𝒥(cid:4672)𝑓(𝑟(cid:3041)),𝑓(cid:3435)𝔼(ℒℳ(𝑄(cid:4593)|𝑦 ))(cid:3439)(cid:4673)(cid:4699) (4)
(cid:3046) (cid:2869)
(cid:3096)(cid:3116),(cid:3096)(cid:3117),(cid:3087)(cid:3117) (cid:2870)
where 𝒯 is a loss function that measures the discrepancy (in Euclidean Norm) between the
actual responses and the predicted responses across all the stakeholders. In other words, we
want lim ℒℳ (𝑢 |𝑢 ,𝑢 ,𝑦 ) → 𝑟, ∀𝑠 ∈𝒮.
(cid:3041) (cid:2869) (cid:2868) (cid:2869) (cid:2869)
(cid:3041)→(cid:2998)
An LLM enables the simulation of realistic stakeholder dialogues and interactions within
the participatory modeling process. The model allows the digital representatives of the
stakeholders to generate nuanced responses, enhancing the depth and realism of participatory
simulations. Let denote the process of sending the initial with input (suppose the initial system
instruction is already provided) as:
𝑦 = ℒℳ(𝑢 |𝑢 ) (5)
(cid:2869) (cid:2869) (cid:2868)
where 𝑢 = 𝑢 (𝜌 ,𝑟) and 𝑢 = 𝑢 (𝑟,𝜌 ). 𝜌 is the prompt template for the initial
(cid:2868) (cid:2868) (cid:2868) (cid:2869) (cid:2869) (cid:2869) (cid:2868)
instruction which is a string with variable length (or a fixed maximum length) and with
dim (𝑟) number of blanks to be filled out by each string element in the vector 𝑟 ∈ ℛ. The
collection of the generated stakeholders is 𝜓 which we can extract from 𝑦 . We use ℱ to
(cid:2869) (cid:3103)
denote the corresponding function that maps the input to the created set of digital avatars.
That is,
𝜓 = ℱ (𝑦 ) (6)
(cid:3103) (cid:2869)
In a group composed of digital avatars and perhaps also real human participants, each
entity is informed of the motivations of the group and is aware of other entities and avatars to
facilitate coherent interactions. The workflow leverages LLMs' prompting capabilities and
includes mechanisms for synthesizing and retrieving information from other agents, leading
9to the generation of innovative ideas and ensuring logical coherence among agents. We can
further add information about the team formation (e.g., who will be the facilitators, etc.)
through adjusting 𝜌 and 𝜌 or through add-on instructions. We define the resultant output
(cid:2868) (cid:2869)
from this step is a tuple of all the inputs and outputs (with sequence preserved). That is 𝑥 =
(cid:2869)
(𝑢 ,𝑢 ,𝑦 ).
(cid:2868) (cid:2869) (cid:2869)
3.3 Collaborative Visioning, Ideation, and Design under Constraints
This step involves utilizing the synthetic team to identify existing problems of the
mobility systems, specifying planning objectives and the associated performance metrics
(including their decision weights), and generating solutions (conceiving design alternatives
and the associated implementation plans). Overall, we can denote the output from the LLM as
𝑦 = ℒℳ(cid:3435)𝑢 (cid:3627)(𝑢 ,𝑢 ,𝑦 )(cid:3439) = ℒℳ(𝑢 |𝑥 ) (7)
(cid:2870) (cid:2870) (cid:2868) (cid:2869) (cid:2869) (cid:2870) (cid:2869)
where 𝑢 = 𝑢 (𝜌 ,𝜃 ). Where 𝜌 is a string with variable lengths that contains the
(cid:2870) (cid:2870) (cid:2870) (cid:2870) (cid:2870)
background information about this stage of decision-making. Vector 𝜃 provides the
(cid:2870)
parameters in this stage that can be joint with the string 𝜌 to for a complete string (𝜌 has at
(cid:2870) (cid:2870)
least dim (𝜃 ) blanks).
(cid:2870)
This step starts with identifying status quo, problems, objectives, and performance
measures. This phase involves the synthetic participants identifying existing conditions,
problems (including constraints), objectives, and performance metrics, which form the basis
for subsequent discussions and decision-making.
The prompt in this step needs to specify the soft and hard constraints that form a clear
decision space, so that 𝓅 = ℱ (𝑦 ), 𝑐𝑎𝑟𝑑(𝓅)= 𝑀 >0, and 𝓅 = 𝐵, where 𝐵 is the complete
𝓅 (cid:2870)
set of 𝑀 constraints. Similarly, we can elicit objectives and performance metrics. That is, 𝒪 =
ℱ (𝑦 ),𝑐𝑎𝑟𝑑(𝒪)= 𝑉 >0, and 𝒦 = ℱ (𝑦 ), 𝑐𝑎𝑟𝑑(𝒦)= 𝐾 ≥ 𝑉 . Each element in 𝒦 is a
𝒪 (cid:2870) 𝒦 (cid:2870)
two-dimensional tuple that contains the score of the performance metric and the corresponding
decision weight. That is, the 𝑘th element of 𝒦(cid:3038) is (𝑔 ,𝑤 ), ∀𝑘 ∈{1,2,…,𝐾}.
(cid:3038) (cid:3038)
The present step then generates solutions and develops alternative using the identified
status quo and the specified objectives and performance metrics. In this phase, participants
ideate solution alternatives while considering constraints and practicality. The process
encourages creativity while ensuring that proposed solutions are feasible and aligned with the
identified objectives. This can be specified as 𝒟 = ℱ (𝑦 ). The final output from this step is

In our methodology, AI assistants play a pivotal role in facilitating different forms of
participatory engagement, tailored to the specific needs of the discussion format. In open
discussions, AI assistants can act as moderators or facilitators, guiding the conversation flow
and ensuring that all stakeholder perspectives are considered. In Delphi sessions, these AI
tools are utilized as summary generators, synthesizing complex inputs into concise overviews
that aid in progressing rounds of expert consultation. Our framework is versatile,
accommodating various configurations from a single AI assistant to multiple agents. In
scenarios where a single AI assistant simulates a discussion or Delphi process, the attention
mechanism of the Large Language Model (LLM) is crucial. It selectively focuses on the
profiles of each virtual agent, drawing from historical outputs to simulate nuanced interactions.
Conversely, in multi-agent setups where each stakeholder is represented by a distinct LLM
agent, the methodology expands to facilitate interactions across agents. Here, the output of
one agent can be seamlessly integrated into the input of another, either sequentially or in
parallel, allowing for a dynamic exchange of ideas and fostering a more comprehensive
deliberative process.
103.4 Collaborative Evaluation of Alternatives and Continuous Improvement
Evaluating design alternatives with specific decision contexts requires evaluation models.
Generally speaking, there are two types – directly utilize the implicit mental models for each
stakeholder (or their digital avatar) to evaluate alternatives in multiple rounds of participatory
modeling sessions to build a common ground. The case study will directly provide the final
set of design alternatives and let the digital avatars to evaluate each alternative. However, we
can also let the synthetic participants to jointly develop simulation models of SAEMS
alternatives (and their interactions with the natural and built environment). The prompts need
to be specific so that that the model has the capability to evaluate all the design alternatives
previously defined with outputs on all the performance metrics. Insights from avatar
interactions enrich these models, enabling a dynamic approach to planning that incorporates
diverse perspectives and preferences. This paper does not prescribe which method is better.
Once we have an evaluation method (generated by or specified by the user of the synthetic
participatory planning process) that allows multiple stakeholders to perform multi-criteria
Evaluation and Decision-Making, the third step of the prompt ensures that the selected
alternatives are evaluated based on various criteria, reflecting the interests and concerns of
different stakeholders.
𝑦 = ℒℳ(𝑢 |𝑥 ) (8)
(cid:2871) (cid:2871) (cid:2870)
where 𝑢 = 𝑢 (𝜌 ,𝜃 ). We can then obtain the final evaluation score vector 𝐸 using a
(cid:2871) (cid:2871) (cid:2871) (cid:2871)
function (operator) ℱ that converts 𝑦 to obtain the attribute value vector, 𝒈, and the
(cid:3006) (cid:2871)
corresponding decision weight vector, 𝒘, for the 𝐽 attributes. The results are 𝑣 = ∑𝑔 ∙𝑤 .
(cid:3036) (cid:3036)(cid:3037) (cid:3037)
If 𝑣 > 𝑣 , then the option 𝑖 is more preferrable than the option 𝑗. That is, 𝑖 ≽ 𝑗. Combining
(cid:3036) (cid:3038)
the previous information along with the new outputs, we have 𝑥 = (𝑢 ,𝑢 ,𝑦 ,𝑢 ,𝑦 ,𝑢 ,𝑦 ).
(cid:2871) (cid:2868) (cid:2869) (cid:2869) (cid:2870) (cid:2870) (cid:2871) (cid:2871)
Figure 3 summarizes the proposed three-step process, where the inputs composed of
strings and parameters are sent into an LLM for obtaining the output responses. Then all the
prior inputs, outputs, and the new prompt (also composed of strings and parameters) are
combined as the new input for the next step. In terms of continuous improvement, we can run
a real participatory process and compare the results with the statistical average condition from
the simulated participatory processes. The proposal is scalable to more than three steps. It is
also allowable to decompose a step into multiple steps.
11Figure 3. Illustration of the proposed multi-step simulation procedure of the synthetic participatory
approach for planning SAEMS.
3.5 Prompt and Parameter Sensitivity Analysis
The sensitivity of the LLM outputs to inputs and parameters is analyzed by varying the
prompts or wordings used in creating the avatars. This analysis is crucial for understanding
how different linguistic formulations affect the calibration process (and hence, the research
conclusions). Let 𝜃 = {𝜃 ,𝜃 ,…,𝜃 ,…,𝜃 },𝜃 ∈ Θ, be the set of 𝐿 LLM parameters
(cid:2869) (cid:2870) (cid:3039) (cid:3013)
corresponding to different prompts. The sensitivity of each parameter 𝜃 is evaluated by
(cid:3036)
measuring the change in the output 𝑢 with respect to the variation of 𝜃 :
(cid:3036) (cid:3036)
𝜕ℒℳ(𝑢 |𝑥 ) 𝜕𝑢
𝛿 = 𝔼(cid:3436)(cid:3533) 𝜎 ∙ (cid:3036) (cid:3036)(cid:2879)(cid:2869) ∙ (cid:3036) (cid:3440) (9)
(cid:3048)(cid:3284):(cid:3087)(cid:3287) (cid:3036) 𝜕𝑢 𝜕𝜃
(cid:3036)∈(cid:3010) (cid:3036) (cid:3039)
Similarly, we can obtain 𝛿 (the sensitivity of 𝑢 with respect to the variation of 𝜌 ).
(cid:3048)(cid:3284):(cid:3096)(cid:3285) (cid:3036) (cid:3037)
As not all the directions of perturbation is feasible (e.g., changing one letter or word in a
prompt sentence might not an comprehensible or Grammarly correct sentence), the equation
above might not be applicable, not to mention that the differentials might not exist. Therefore,
we have 𝜎 being a dummy variable with 1 when the direction is differentiable, and 0 if not.
(cid:3036)
To perform sensitivity analysis, various techniques can be employed, depending on the
complexity of the function and the availability of data. Due to the complexity of an LLM, even
we have the complete information about the model architecture and parameters, it might still
not be impractical to use analytical methods (direct calculation of sensitivity coefficients with
closed forms). Therefore, numerical Methods (numerical techniques such as finite difference
methods can be used to approximate the derivatives) and Monte Carlo simulations (especially
when dealing with uncertainty in inputs or parameters) are recommended.
12The results of sensitivity analysis provide valuable insights into the behavior of the
proposed system and method. High sensitivity coefficients indicate that the function is highly
responsive to changes in the corresponding input or parameter, which may require careful
control or robust design. On the other hand, low sensitivity coefficients suggest that the
function is relatively insensitive, allowing for more flexibility in design and operation.
4. Case Study
This case study delves into the application of the synthetic participatory approach within
the urban mobility planning landscape of Montreal—a city renowned for its dedication to
sustainable transportation and pioneering infrastructure initiatives. The goal of this study is to
showcase the enhanced efficacy of integrating LLM-enabled digital avatars with multi-criteria
decision-making strategies.
4.1 Background
Montreal, the largest city in Quebec, Canada, is characterized by its diverse population,
extensive public transportation network, and various social events and tourism activities. The
city has been implementing sustainable mobility solutions, such as expanding its bike-sharing
program, developing pedestrian-friendly streets, and introducing electric buses to its public
transit fleet. Despite these efforts, Montreal faces challenges like traffic congestion, aging
infrastructure, and balancing transportation demands with environmental sustainability goals.
The city has set ambitious goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, increase the use of public
and active transportation modes, and enhance urban mobility systems' efficiency and
accessibility. In fact, REM is already a good example of the city and region’s effort on
automating and electrifying the mass transit systems.
As the present paper is being written, the city is in the process of producing their 2050
Land Use and Mobility Plan1, which recognizes the interactions of land use and mobility
services and hence simultaneously plans for the two major aspects. There are six phases in this
process. Phase I (Assessing the city’s situation) and Phase II (Imagining possible futures) have
been completed. It is now collecting public comments regarding the current city vision from
Phase II. The city will improve the vision and the implementation strategy (Phase IV). In
Phase V, the city council will provide additional comments and decide whether to adopt the
plan. Phase VI will focus on implementing the plan and monitoring the progress (and adjust
when necessary). The process started in around 2019 (and just finished Phase II in year 2024),
indicating the heavy effort and cost of producing such a plan. The previous plan was released
in 2008 with following five main objectives:
 Create optimal conditions for getting around the city
 Improve residents’ quality of life
 Improve the environment
 Support the vitality of Montréal’s economy
 Integrate the planning of transportation with that of land use
The SAEMS planning in the present case study has a narrower scope than that of the
city’s ongoing land use and mobility plan, as the case study focuses on planning the SAEMS
(as a subsystem of Montreal’s mobility system). However, the publicly available information
released by the present planning process is likely to provide useful information. The rest of
the case study will refer to the existing reports such as the report presenting the results of
1 Montreal’s 2050 Land Use and Mobility Plan: https://montreal.ca/en/articles/creating-2050-land-use-
and-mobility-plan-15575
13citizen focus group, the report on the city project ideation workshop, the sustainable mobility
survey, and (Phase II’s) City Vision: Imaging the Montreal of 2050. I leave the study of
expanding the study scope using the proposed synthetic participatory approach to future
research.
4.2 Prompting and Output Processing
Creating Human Agents and AI Assistants: Prompt Engineering and Calibration. The process
begins with introducing the decision context and purpose to the AI agent that will simulate the
participatory planning process. For 𝜌 , we have:
(cid:2868)
“You are an expert in simulating a participatory planning process for the City of
Montreal's future shared automated electric mobility systems (SAEMS). Suppose the
planning activity occurs in the year 2024, and the planning horizon year is 2044.”
Then, we prompt to construct digital avatars representing Montreal's stakeholders such
as residents, policymakers, urban planners, and transportation engineers. Instead of using the
prompt to detailing their socioeconomic backgrounds, temperaments, and preferences, this
case study directly prompts to request the generation of 𝑆 number of stakeholders. The profiles
(and the associated probability distributions) of the generated stakeholder avatars are one main
aspect of our research interest. For 𝜌 , we have:
(cid:2869)
“Create 𝜃 stakeholder(s) as their digital avatar(s).”
(cid:2869)
Due to the stochasticity of LLM outputs, the LLM will respond by requesting additional
details instead of directly generating digital representatives in rare occasions. In simulations,
we drop these cases, though it is likely that further prompting can help utilize these cases.
Team Formation and Synthetic Participatory Process. In this step, we use two sequential
prompts to guide the AI agent. We simplify the case by not introducing any real stakeholder
participant in the participatory process. The team composed of (only) digital representatives
of the stakeholders engages in a participatory process that includes identifying existing
conditions, objectives, and performance metrics; then the team collaborative generates
solution alternatives (design alternatives and implementation plans). Various participatory
methods, such as the Synthetic Delphi approach and Synthetic focus groups, are explored to
determine their impact on the planning outcomes.
For 𝜌(cid:2869), we have
(cid:2870)
“Concretely simulate the process and obtain the results from using a 𝜃(cid:2869)-round Delphi
(cid:2870)
method to let them collaboratively identify issues, objectives, performance metrics,
and decision weights for each round. Then synthesize the information to form 5 issues,
5 objectives, 10 performance metrics (0-10 for each metric), and decision weights
(sum up to 1.0). Be clear which performance metric is for which objective.”
For 𝜌(cid:2870), we have
(cid:2870)
“Concretely simulate a 𝜃(cid:2870)-min free-style brainstorming session to generate 3
(cid:2870)
mutually exclusive SAEMS alternatives with detailed specifications and the
corresponding 20-year implementation plans with 4-year intervals (with a specific
monetary amount for each interval) under a total budget of $𝜃(cid:2871) million CAD (Net
(cid:2870)
Present Value).”
Evaluation, Decision-Making, and Team Adjustment. The synthetic participants
collaboratively develop models to evaluate solution alternatives, using the multi-criteria
evaluation and decision framework. For 𝜌 , we have:
(cid:2871)
14“Evaluate the alternatives using the previously identified performance metrics --
make best guess about values about the variables and probabilities collaboratively.
Compare the final scores and recommend the best alternative.”
4.3 Parameterization, Baseline, and Scenario Settings
The participatory process leads to the development of objectives, performance metrics,
identifying key variables and their interactions within specific SAEMS. Key parameters, such
as team size, participatory methods, and associated durations and efforts, are defined for
different settings. The process results in identifying key issues, objectives, performance
metrics, stakeholders, design alternatives, and final selection of the most suitable plan for
Montreal's SAEMS.
The defined settings provide a structured approach to explore the impacts of different
team compositions and participatory methods on the synthetic participatory planning process.
This parameterization allows for a systematic analysis of how variations in the planning
process influence the identification of problems, objectives, performance metrics, and the
development and evaluation of alternatives for Montreal's SAEMS.
Key parameters include team size (𝜃 ), number of Delphi rounds for identifying problems,
(cid:2869)
objectives, and performance metrics (𝜃(cid:2869)), the duration of free-style discussion and ideation
(cid:2870)
(𝜃(cid:2870)) in minutes, and the budget constraints (𝜃(cid:2871)) in million Canadian dollars (net present value,
(cid:2870) (cid:2870)
NPV). We set the base scenario as [𝜃 ,𝜃(cid:2869),𝜃(cid:2870),𝜃(cid:2871)]= [10,3,90,150]. In the next section, we
(cid:2869) (cid:2870) (cid:2870) (cid:2870)
will first present the results (including the stochasticity) of the base scenario. Then we will
explore the impact of perturbating the base scenario on the results of the synthetic participatory
process.
Note that in the case study, we essentially use words such as Delphi and free-style
brainstorming or discussions as parameters rather than simulating the specific conversations
or dialogues. We leave simulating the conversations or dialogues to future research.
5. Simulation Results
This section presents the results of the synthetic participatory planning process for
SAEMS in Montreal. The simulation outcomes are discussed under two main subsections:
base scenario results and sensitivity analysis of different scenarios based on various prompt
settings. One complete round of simulation instance is shown in Appendix A. The simulations
are performed using the OpenAI API version “gpt-4-turbo-preview” in February and March
2024.
5.1 Baseline Instance
In this subsection, we analyze the results of multiple runs of the baseline scenario, where
each simulation generates a different set of five stakeholders. Table 1 shows the 10 generated
digital representatives of the stakeholders in SAEMS. Each avatar has a unique perspective
and stake in the successful planning and implementation of SAEMS, demonstrating the
necessity of a collaborative approach that recognizes and addresses the wide range of concerns
and objectives. We can further request additional detailing for each avatar, and we leave the
investigation of the optimal fidelity for a given SAEMS decision context to future research.

The brainstorming session yielded three distinct SAEMS alternatives focusing on
comprehensive transit solutions, modular mobility integration, and environmental
sustainability.
16Alternative 1: The Eco-Friendly Route focuses on minimize environmental impact and
promote sustainability. Specifically, the city will deploy shared electric vehicles (EVs) fleets
with high energy efficiency and low emissions and invest in installation of renewable energy
charging stations powered by solar and wind energy, and promote the implementation of green
roofs, permeable pavement, and urban green spaces to mitigate heat island effect and enhance
biodiversity. The collaborative generated implementation plan is:
 Years 1-4: Pilot phase in downtown areas, deploying 100 EVs and 50 charging
stations ($20 million).
 Years 5-8: Expand to suburban areas, increasing fleet size to 300 EVs and 150
charging stations ($30 million).
 Years 9-12: Integrate with public transit network, adding 500 EVs and 250 charging
stations ($40 million).
 Years 13-16: Enhance infrastructure resilience, with upgrades to 700 EVs and 350
charging stations ($25 million).
 Years 17-20: Evaluate and improve system efficiency, optimizing fleet operations and
adding 800 EVs and 400 charging stations ($35 million).
Alternative 2: The Equity and Accessibility Initiative focuses on improving transportation
access for all communities. Specifications: (1) Inclusive Design: Implement accessible vehicle
designs and infrastructure to accommodate individuals with disabilities, (2) affordable Fares:
Introduce fare structures that consider income levels and provide subsidies for low-income
users, and (3) accessible stations: Upgrade existing and new stations to be accessible to
individuals with mobility challenges. The collaborative generated implementation plan is:
 Years 1-4: Accessibility upgrades in key locations, retrofitting 50 stations and 200
vehicles ($15 million).
 Years 5-8: Expand service to underserved areas, adding 500 vehicles and 100 new
stations ($35 million).
 Years 9-12: Implement fare subsidies for low-income users, providing discounts and
incentives ($30 million).
 Years 13-16: Enhance accessibility features, adding 300 vehicles and upgrading 50
stations ($25 million).
 Years 17-20: Conduct community outreach and feedback, engaging with stakeholders
to improve accessibility ($25 million).
Alternative 3: The Technological Innovation Pathway focuses on Pioneer new
technologies and enhance user experience. Specifications: (1) Autonomous Vehicles: Deploy
a fleet of autonomous vehicles with advanced safety features and AI-driven capabilities, (2)
AI-driven Route Optimization: Implement AI algorithms to optimize vehicle routes and
minimize congestion, and (3) Smart Infrastructure: Upgrade infrastructure to support smart
connectivity, enabling real-time communication between vehicles and infrastructure. The
collaborative generated implementation plan is:
 Years 1-4: Pilot autonomous vehicle fleet, introducing 50 autonomous vehicles and
testing AI algorithms ($25 million).
 Years 5-8: Expand autonomous fleet and implement AI-driven route optimization,
adding 200 autonomous vehicles and optimizing routes ($40 million).
 Years 9-12: Upgrade infrastructure for smart connectivity, installing sensors and
communication systems ($30 million).
 Years 13-16: Enhance user experience with app integration, developing user-friendly
apps for trip planning and payment ($20 million).
17 Years 17-20: Evaluate and integrate emerging technologies, upgrading systems based
on feedback and technological advancements ($35 million).
The description, specification, and implementation plans (4-year intervals) are
summarized in Table 3. Each alternative comes with a pragmatic 20-year phased
implementation plan (with 5-year intervals), indicating financial implications to the
stakeholders. Table 4 summarizes the collaborative multi-criteria evaluation of the three
alternatives.
Based on the provided metrics and estimated scores, the “Eco” alternative emerges as the
most favorable option in terms of both the total score (38) and the weighted score (7.75). This
alternative is scored high in integration with emission minimization and its complementary
nature to infrastructure such as public transit, factors that are critical to the successful and
sustainable implementation of SAEMS. Although the “Equitable” and “Techno” alternatives
present compelling benefits in areas such as congestion reduction, accessibility and
affordability, they fall slightly behind “Eco” in comprehensive fit, innovation, and public
transit synergy. The “Eco” alternative also has a moderate requirement for financial
commitment in the initialization phase (the first five years), allowing the public agency for
lower risk (compared to the “Techno” alternative. Continued stakeholder engagement and
detailed feasibility studies will be essential in refining and implementing this ambitious plan.

5.2 Sensitivity Analysis
This subsection explores how the results of the synthetic participatory planning process change
in response to different settings. The analysis aims to understand the impact of variations in
team size, participatory methods, and the duration/effort allocated to different phases of the
process on the planning outcomes.
5.2.1 Impact on Stakeholder Profiles
We examine the frequency of different stakeholder profiles generated in the simulations. To
analyze the synthetic stakeholder profiles generated across multiple simulations, we employ a
time with bar charts for different parameter settings, where we visualize the frequency of each
stakeholder type. This provides a clear view of which profiles are most commonly generated
and how they are distributed across simulations. Figure 4 shows the distribution of a
stakeholder type to appear at least once from 150 simulations for each parameter setting.
With the increase of the number of stakeholders, generated synthetic stakeholders that are fall
in the same categories start to increase, though the specifics start to increase. For example, one
simulation might generates a resident’s association leader, a senior citizen representative, and
youth representative, all of whom fall into community representatives. The LLM also starts
generating different types of urban planners and engineers. For example, the LLM starts
generating different types of planners that focus on land zoning, public parks, transportation,
etc. We also notice that with the increase from 1 to 10 stakeholders, the coverage of
stakeholders (at least by one stakeholder) start to quickly increase, while from 10 to 20, most
additional stakeholders fall into existing categories (i.e., there are more likely to have more
than one stakeholder that in one category). This results show that explicitly requesting the
LLM to generate more can avoid the agent directly assumes that the key decision-maker is a
city or urban planner.

215.2.2 Impact on Objectives and Performance Metrics.
The influence of varying team sizes (denoted as S) and the number of Delphi rounds (denoted
as R) on the articulation of objectives and performance metrics, including the assignment of
decision weights, is critically evaluated through comparative analysis across multiple
simulation scenarios. Simulations incorporating different numbers of stakeholder avatars are
conducted to discern the effects of larger team compositions. While more extensive teams tend
to offer a wider array of perspectives, they also introduce increased complexity in interactions
and potentially protract the decision-making process. To systematically analyze these
dynamics, the objectives identified across simulations are categorized into ten distinct groups,
as detailed in Table 5. Additionally, Figure 5 presents a summary of the average decision
weights assigned in each configuration along with their standard deviations, reflecting the
inherent stochasticity of the simulation outcomes.

22Figure 5. Decision weights for each category of objective and for each of the four parameter
settings (team size and Delphi number of rounds).
As evidenced across various scenarios, the objectives concerning environmental and
sustainability impact, congestion, safety, and accessibility consistently received higher
decision weights. Interestingly, as the team size increases, the distribution of weights becomes
more even, suggesting a broader consensus among a larger group of stakeholders. However,
the impact of increasing the number of Delphi rounds appears nonlinear. Transitioning from
one to three stakeholders tends to produce more specific objectives and lower variation in
decision weights, possibly indicating the LLM's capacity for simulating a consensus-building
effect. Conversely, expanding the team from three to five stakeholders does not yield
significant changes, suggesting diminishing sensitivity to additional Delphi rounds. Larger
groups may also require more rounds to achieve consensus, highlighting a potential efficiency
trade-off.
Moreover, analysis of the 'negative' boundary conditions reveals that when decision weights
are low, they tend to be highly skewed. Specifically, certain alternatives are seldom selected
(thus, often receiving zero weight); however, when these alternatives are chosen, their weights
typically range from 0.10 to 0.20. This pattern underscores the importance of framing and
participatory methods in replicating results for validation and mitigating common biases in
participatory decision-making.
Further analysis suggests that increasing the number of Delphi rounds beyond three yields
minimal impact on consensus quality. Both small groups with fewer rounds and larger groups
with more rounds tend to lead to more evenly distributed weights, posing an interesting
question for real-world applicability. The exploration of a more diverse range of participatory
methods—transitioning from structured approaches like the Delphi method to more free-form
discussions—could provide insightful contrasts. Different methods likely influence the level
of consensus, depth of discussion, and creativity of the solutions generated, shaping the
dynamics of the planning process in distinct ways."
5.2.3 Impact on Design Alternatives and the Evaluation
This subsection conducts a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the impact of team size, the duration
of free-style ideation sessions, and budget constraints on the identification of issues and
development of alternatives within the synthetic participatory process. We hypothesize that
23longer durations might allow for more in-depth discussions, while shorter sessions could
necessitate more efficient and focused deliberations. Our results help assess the robustness of
baseline scenario outcomes and identify potential areas for optimization. Settings that
consistently yield better alignment with planning objectives might be favored in future
simulations. We explore the diversity of design alternatives conceived by synthetic teams and
their alignment with the identified objectives and performance metrics. The analysis focuses
on several common design alternatives generated during the planning process, as summarized
in Table 6. The frequency and distribution of these alternatives across simulations highlight
trends and preferences among synthetic teams. For instance, a frequent selection of a particular
alternative might indicate a strong emphasis on optimizing certain aspects like travel
efficiency.

Each design alternative undergoes evaluation based on its alignment with established
objectives and performance metrics. For example, an alternative might score highly on
environmental impacts due to the integration of electric transit systems, while another might
be favored for enhancing accessibility.
The variability in the evaluation results is analyzed through the distribution and scores for
each performance metric. A radar chart is utilized to visualize the variability in priorities
among synthetic teams across simulations (Figure 6). This method allows us to identify
common trends or outliers in planning outcomes.
Smaller teams tend to favor alternatives that align closely with the expertise of urban planners
and engineers, while larger teams (15 members or more) do not exhibit significant changes in
preference, suggesting a saturation point in the influence of team size on decision-making. We
24select the most representative cases for analysis instead of averaging, to avoid obscuring trade-
offs inherent in the planning process. It is evident that budget constraint is an important factor.
As shown in the case of “S10-R3-D90-B150,” the trade-off effect among different objectives
are clearly lessened than the trade offs in other settings that have
This comprehensive analysis of the evaluation scores provides insights into the strengths and
weaknesses of each design alternative, guiding the refinement of urban mobility strategies for
Montreal.

6. Discussion
The results from the participatory modeling process for Montreal's SAEMS underscore the
potential for significant improvements in urban mobility, environmental sustainability, and
social inclusivity. This discussion section reflects on the implications of these findings, the
challenges encountered during the modeling and simulation process, comparison with existing
literature on Montreal’s opinion elicitation and participatory planning effort, and the broader
relevance of this study to urban mobility planning and policy.
6.1 Implications of Findings
The application of the synthetic participatory approach using LLM-enabled digital avatars
significantly enhances the inclusivity and efficiency of the urban mobility planning process.
By simulating a diverse range of stakeholder inputs, this approach ensures that multiple
perspectives are considered, reducing the risk of overlooking critical aspects of urban mobility.
This method also streamlines the decision-making process, allowing for quicker iterations and
adaptations to new information.
The findings suggest that varying team sizes and Delphi round numbers can influence the
diversity and quality of planning outcomes. Smaller teams tend to produce more focused and
efficient deliberations, which could be advantageous in early stages of planning when quick
25decisions are needed. Larger teams, however, provide broader perspectives, beneficial for
comprehensive strategic planning where diverse inputs are crucial.
The synthetic participatory approach presents a cost-effective alternative to traditional
methods by reducing the logistical and financial burdens associated with organizing physical
meetings and managing stakeholder engagement over long periods. This aspect is particularly
relevant for cities with limited resources but high aspirations for improving urban mobility.
6.2 Technical Challenges and Clarifications
One of the primary challenges encountered in the participatory modeling process is ensuring
that digital avatars accurately and comprehensively represent real-world stakeholders. While
the avatars are effective in simulating a range of perspectives, they may not fully capture the
breadth of real-world experiences and concerns. Ongoing efforts to enhance the realism and
depth of these representations are essential, as is continuous validation with empirical data to
ensure that the avatars remain relevant and accurate over time.
Balancing the complexity of the models with the need for actionable insights presents a
significant challenge. Overly complex models risk becoming impractical for decision-makers,
as they can obfuscate clear paths to action with excessive detail. Conversely, overly simplified
models may fail to capture essential dynamics of the system, potentially leading to suboptimal
decisions. Finding the right balance to maintain both model utility and manageability is critical.
Integrating the outputs of simulations into a cohesive analytical framework can be challenging.
Each simulation might generate varying design alternatives, and grouping similar alternatives
for statistical analysis often requires manual intervention. Additionally, synthesizing
qualitative insights from various rounds into a unified analysis presents further complications.
Strategies to automate these processes and enhance the analytical capabilities of the simulation
software are needed.
The introduction of digital avatars and synthetic participatory processes raises complex issues
in their estimation, calibration, and validation. Developing robust methods for accurately
simulating and adjusting these avatars to reflect evolving stakeholder views is crucial.
Although this paper recognizes these challenges, detailed solutions and methodologies are
subjects for future research.The case study utilizes a single LLM for simulating the cases. The
use of multiple Large LLMs simulate multi-stakeholder decision-making might introduce
significant computational demands, and one might still needs one more LLM to coordinate the
interactions. However, comparing single-agent versus multi-agent configurations might
reveals interesting differences in performance and feasibility. Launching multiple LLM
instances to simulate individual agents and facilitating inter-agent communication can be
computationally intensive but may offer more comprehensive insights by mimicking more
dynamic and realistic interactions among stakeholders. I acknowledge the need for further
clarification on the optimal use of single versus multi-agent approaches in synthetic
participatory processes.
6.3 Relationship with Existing Literature on Participatory Planning in Montreal
The proposed synthetic participatory planning approach for SAEMS has the promise to be
further developed on methods and findings from the existing literature on (public and expert)
opinion elicitation and participatory planning in Montreal. The literature reveals a growing
interest in understanding public preferences and involving diverse stakeholders in the
transportation planning process, which aligns with the objectives of our proposed method.
Various studies such as (Damant-Sirois & El-Geneidy, 2015; Dent et al., 2021; Mildenberger
et al., 2016; Thouez et al., 2007; Zapolskytė et al., 2022)highlight the importance of capturing
public opinions and preferences to inform transportation policies and infrastructure projects.
26Our synthetic participatory approach, by integrating digital avatars representing diverse
stakeholders, offers a novel way to incorporate a broad spectrum of opinions and preferences
in the planning process. This inclusivity is crucial for addressing complex issues like climate
change and urban mobility, where public support and acceptance are essential for successful
implementation.
The literature on participatory planning in Montreal, including works by (Boisjoly & Yengoh,
2017b; Gauthier, 2005; Kold-Taylor & de Guerre, 2020) emphasizes the need for inclusive and
participatory processes to develop sustainable and equitable transportation solutions. Our
synthetic participatory method aligns with this emphasis by enabling a virtual participatory
process that can complement traditional public consultation methods. This approach can
potentially overcome some of the limitations identified in the literature, such as the narrow
contribution of local communities in the planning process and the challenges of integrating
diverse perspectives.
By leveraging LLMs and digital avatars, our method advances the paradigm of participatory
planning in several ways. First, it allows for more dynamic and iterative engagement with
stakeholders, enabling the exploration of a wider range of scenarios and alternatives. Second,
it provides a cost-efficient way to improve the inclusivity and interpretability of multi-
objective transportation planning, addressing the call for more flexible and innovative policy
responses highlighted in the literature (Lesteven & Godillon, 2020). Finally, our method
contributes to the ongoing discussion on how to effectively integrate public opinions and
participatory approaches into transportation planning, offering a new avenue for enhancing
the sustainability and resilience of urban transportation systems.
6.4 Future Research and Broader Implications
Future studies should consider exploring the potential correlations between specific
stakeholder profiles and the objectives and design alternatives identified in the planning
process. For instance, if a strong correlation exists between 'Traffic Congestion' and the profile
of 'Transportation Engineer', this would imply that transportation engineers are frequently
generated in simulations where traffic congestion is a key issue. Conversely, a weak or
negative correlation might indicate a lesser association of transportation engineers with traffic
congestion problems. Such analyses could help in understanding how different stakeholder
profiles influence the prioritization of various urban mobility challenges. However, the
interaction among stakeholders and their influence on planning outcomes may not always be
straightforward or additive, posing challenges in correlation analysis. Detailed investigation
into these complex, nonlinear relationships is necessary to refine the synthetic participatory
planning process, ensuring the most relevant perspectives are included in decision-making.
The synthetic participatory approach introduces the possibility for digital-real hybrid
interactions, which can significantly enhance the learning and adaptation processes within
urban planning. This method allows for adjustments in procedural details and can even reset
or rewind deliberations, providing a dynamic platform for testing various scenarios and
strategies. Future research could explore how these capabilities could be exploited to
streamline the planning process, merging traditionally sequential phases into parallel activities.
This could potentially accelerate the overall planning cycle, from public opinion elicitation to
plan development and feedback gathering.
With advancements in multimodal LLMs, there is a promising avenue for incorporating
experiential learning into the synthetic participatory process. Future applications could include
showing pictures and videos of infrastructure and urban environments to digital avatars,
enhancing their understanding and responsiveness to real-world contexts. This multimodal
27interaction could further improve the realism and effectiveness of the synthetic deliberations,
providing a richer, more immersive planning experience.
An intriguing aspect for further investigation is the impact of varying personalities and
backgrounds of the digital avatars on the planning outcomes. Understanding how these
characteristics influence the deliberation dynamics and decision-making processes could
provide deeper insights into human-machine collaboration. Future research could explore how
different configurations of avatar personalities and backgrounds affect the robustness and
creativity of urban mobility solutions.
Another critical area of research is the examination of the nonlinear dynamics in stakeholder
interactions within the synthetic participatory framework. The specific prompts and
configurations of LLMs used in simulations may significantly influence these dynamics.
Detailed studies on how these factors interact and affect the decision-making process could
lead to more sophisticated and nuanced models, better suited to handle the complexities of
urban mobility planning.
By addressing these areas, future research can significantly advance our understanding of the
synthetic participatory process and its application to urban mobility planning. These efforts
will not only enhance the methodology but also broaden its applicability and effectiveness in
addressing the multifaceted challenges of urban environments.
7. Conclusion
This paper has introduced a novel synthetic participatory approach to urban mobility planning,
utilizing LLMs to generate digital avatars representing diverse stakeholder groups. The case
study centered on Montreal's hypothetical planning of future SAEMS as demonstrated the
potential of this method to revolutionize traditional participatory planning processes by
enhancing efficiency, inclusivity, and adaptability. The findings indicate that the synthetic
participatory approach facilitates a more comprehensive integration of stakeholder
perspectives, leading to robust and diverse urban mobility solutions. By employing digital
avatars, the method overcomes many of the logistical and financial barriers associated with
traditional stakeholder engagement. Moreover, the flexibility to simulate various stakeholder
interactions and scenarios allows for a more thorough exploration of potential outcomes and
strategies, ensuring that urban mobility plans are both resilient and forward-thinking.
The study contributes to the field of urban planning and transportation systems engineering by
illustrating how AI can be synergistically combined with participatory models to enhance the
decision-making process. The use of AI not only augments the capacity to process and
integrate large volumes of unstructured (mostly text) data but also enables the simulation of
complex stakeholder dynamics that would be difficult to manage in real-world settings. This
approach is particularly beneficial for cities like Montreal, where urban mobility challenges
are compounded by diverse population needs and environmental considerations. The
implications of this research extend to policy development and urban planning practice. By
providing a clearer understanding of how different stakeholder inputs affect mobility
outcomes, policymakers can make more informed decisions that align with broader social,
economic, and environmental goals. Furthermore, the methodology outlined in this paper
offers a replicable and scalable model that other cities can adapt to their specific contexts,
promoting a more systematic and interpretable approach to urban mobility planning.
Despite its strengths, the synthetic participatory approach faces challenges, including the
accuracy and authenticity of stakeholder representation through digital avatars, and the
complexity of managing advanced AI systems. Future research should focus on refining these
models to enhance their realism and applicability. Additionally, longitudinal studies are
28needed to assess the long-term impacts of decisions facilitated by this AI-augmented
participatory process.
While challenges remain, the synthetic participatory planning process represents a significant
advancement in how cities can approach urban mobility planning. It offers a promising
pathway toward creating more sustainable, efficient, and inclusive urban environments. As
technological capabilities continue to evolve, so too will the opportunities to further enhance
this approach.
