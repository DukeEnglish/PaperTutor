Abstract. Power-to-Hydrogen is crucial for the renewable energy transition, yet
existing literature lacks business models for the significant excess heat it gener-
ates. This study addresses this by evaluating three models for selling electrolyzer-
generated heat to district heating grids: constant, flexible, and renewable-source
hydrogen production, with and without heat sales. Using agent-based modeling
and multi-criteria decision-making methods (VIKOR, TOPSIS, PROMETHEE),
it finds that selling excess heat can cut hydrogen production costs by 5.6%. The
optimal model operates flexibly with electricity spot prices, includes heat sales,
and maintains a hydrogen price of 3.3 EUR/kg. Environmentally, hydrogen pro-
duction from grid electricity could emit up to 13,783.8 tons of CO2 over four
years from 2023. The best economic and environmental model uses renewable
sources and sells heat at 3.5 EUR/kg.

1 Introduction
The extensive deployment of renewable energy sources in the green transition is
facilitated by sector coupling, which aims to reduce emissions across various sectors.
For example, green electricity from wind is utilized for heating via heat pumps or for
powering electric vehicles in transportation. However, options for electrifying heavy
transportation, such as cargo ships and airplanes, are limited due to the constraints of
battery technology [1]. To bridge this gap, the Power-to-X (P2X) concept is introduced,
enabling broad sector coupling through the production of renewable hydrogen. This
hydrogen can then be used directly or converted into other fuels like methanol and am-
monia.
This paper focuses on the potential of using excess heat from electrolyzers in the
P2X value chain for district heating. Specifically, it examines the Power-to-Hydrogen
ecosystem, excluding other segments of the value chain post-hydrogen production. The
potential for heat utilization through three business models for electrolyzer operation is2 K. Christensen et al.
explored. These models are simulated in an agent-based framework and evaluated
based on their Levelized Cost of Hydrogen (LCoH), both with and without the sale of
excess heat. To determine the optimal operation, three Multi-Criteria Decision-Making
(MCDM) methods are applied.
The structure of this paper is as follows: it begins with a background on the utiliza-
tion of excess heat from electrolyzers, followed by an explanation of the methodology
used. The case study introduction sets the stage for scenarios and simulation experi-
ments, which detail the conducted simulations and present the findings in the results
and discussion section. The paper concludes with a summary of the key findings.
2 Background
The majority of the literature considers the Power-to-Hydrogen and Heat (P2HH) in
a system, including a Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plant. CHPs’ heat production
is constrained due to the co-production of electricity. Here, the excess heat utilization
from P2X facilities can provide more flexibility to the CHP plant [2-4].
The characteristics of P2HH found in the literature are the use of the electrolyzer’s
excess heat via a heat exchanger in the district heating network. The electrolyzer tech-
nologies used are Alkaline (operating temperature of 60–90 °C) or Proton Exchange
Membrane (PEM) (operating temperature of 50–80 °C). The electrolyzer is modeled
using the Temperature, Heat, and Hydrogen (T-H-H) relationship for modeling the
electrolyzer. The Mixed Integer Linear Programming is commonly used to optimize the
operation.
The available relatively high temperatures from the electrolysis in the Proton Ex-
change Membrane or Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM) electrolyzer, and Alkaline
electrolyzer (most common and mature electrolyzers) are high enough for supplying
directly to the district heating network in Denmark (feed temperatures of ~60 °C [5])
through a heat exchanger. This means that there is no need for upgrading the tempera-
ture, meaning solutions concerning industrial excess heat recovery solutions are not
relevant [6].
Currently, 96% of hydrogen in Europe comes from natural gas, and there is no spe-
cific market structure for green hydrogen [7]. Therefore, green hydrogen still primarily
integrates into the larger gas market, often through conventional supply chains that
might include on-site production or pre-agreed sales. From a national perspective, e.g.,
in Denmark, heat from the hydrogen production process has been accounted for within
the P2X ecosystem. However, no literature has discussed business models for the utili-
zation of excess heat, but rather for the electrolyzer operations through the classical
business model of cross-commodity arbitrage trading (between the electricity market
and the hydrogen market), as well as the provision of flexibility at control reserve mar-
kets [8, 9]. Three business models are identified based on the market search:
The most prevalent business model adopted by most Danish companies referred to
as "Constant Hydrogen Production", is largely shaped by the prevailing conditions in
the hydrogen market. This approach signifies a prominent pattern of consistent hydro-
gen generation irrespective of market fluctuations and demands. It reflects theMulti-agent based modeling for investigating excess heat utilization 3
traditional way of producing hydrogen from natural gas or methan (referred to as grey
hydrogen) [10], which is assumed to be produced based on demand and hydrogen pur-
chase agreements [11].
A second business model, known as "Flexible Production Following Electricity
Prices" also known as cross-commodity arbitrage trading, mirrors the current hourly
electricity pricing scheme for Danish electricity consumers, including households. This
model incorporates dynamic pricing, where the cost of production fluctuates in line
with the prevailing electricity prices [8, 12, 13]. It is assumed that the hydrogen pur-
chase agreements account for this operation type.
The third business model, termed "Hydrogen Production from Own Renewable En-
ergy Sources", encapsulates the pilot projects facilitated by Danish DSO – Energinet
[14]. This model ensures the production of green hydrogen and potentially allows to
access cheaper electricity prices due to its associated renewable energy generations.
3 Methodology
New business models for large-scale electrolyzers are expected to evolve due to matur-
ing digital energy solutions that are expected to improve energy efficiency and enable
energy flexibility, which are key value propositions of the P2X concept [15]. To ensure
that this research accounts for future changes in the business ecosystem, it will follow
the agent-based simulation framework for evaluating energy flexibility solutions and
adoption strategies proposed in [16]. In the framework, the targeted business ecosys-
tems are identified and translated into multi-agent based models that capture all eco-
system dynamics, and the associated solutions can be evaluated.
To navigate the complexity of the P2X business ecosystem, this study employs
agent-based modeling, capturing ecosystem dynamics by representing actors as agents
with defined roles and interactions modeled through Java interfaces [17, 18]. This
model is developed using the multi-method simulation tool AnyLogic [19]. For sim-
plicity, the model focuses on Power-to-Hydrogen, but it is designed to allow easy in-
clusion of additional agents and interactions to reflect a broader ecosystem [20, 21].
Key agents include:
• Electrolyzer: Processes water and electricity to produce hydrogen and excess
heat.
• Transmission System Operator (TSO): Manages day-ahead electricity prices
and provides grid tariffs at the transmission level, ignoring the market dynam-
ics in the simulation.
• Heat Exchanger: Transfers heat between the electrolyzer's cooling system and
the district heating grid, accounting for efficiency. It may be replaced by heat
pumps if needed.
• District Heating Grid: Acts as a simple receiver of all heat produced by the
electrolyzer without further detail.
• District Heating Operator: Adds pricing to the heat supplied by the electro-
lyzer.4 K. Christensen et al.
• P2X Company: Handles operational logic within the electrolyzer, calculating
operation costs, revenue, and profit.
• Electricity Grid: Connects directly to the transmission level and is considered
a black box in this scenario, eventually to be detailed further.
• Hydrogen Customer: Engages in contractual arrangements with the P2X Com-
pany to purchase hydrogen.
• Hydrogen Infrastructure: Represents the endpoint for hydrogen flow, consist-
ing of storage and pipeline flow.
• Water Treatment Plant: Provides the electrolyzer with clean water, potentially
expanding to include resource usage data based on raw water sources.
• Wind Turbine: Supplies the electrolyzer with electricity from wind, with cost
metrics compared against market prices.
• Photovoltaics: Converts solar radiation into electricity, important for hydrogen
production from renewable resources.
The simulation calculates variable costs such as electricity and water, and revenues
from selling heat and hydrogen to determine the LCoH. The operation hours, influenced
by the operation strategy, affect the LCoH. The most effective operation is evaluated
with MCDM methods (PROMETHEE, TOPSIS, and VIKOR) [22]. These methods,
programmed using the "pymcdm" Python library [23], assess simulation outcomes with
both equal and entropy weighting to objectively weigh decision criteria.
4 Case study
The case study used in this paper is an industrial park, Greenlab Skive, Denmark [24],
which among other facilities consists of a large-scale 12 MW electrolysis plant together
with 80 MW of renewable energy resources and is located close to an existing district
heating grid. The electrolyzer is Alkaline as it is the most common electrolyzer type
used in Denmark. Table 1 shows the parameters used in the simulation. The prices
shown in the table are assumed to be the same in the future, meaning they are used in
the future years in the simulation. For example, electricity prices are looped throughout
the simulation.

5 Scenarios and simulation experiments
The simulation scenarios incorporate three business models: Scenario 1 involves con-
stant hydrogen production; Scenario 2 adapts production based on electricity prices;
Scenario 3 generates hydrogen using renewable energy sources. Additionally, all sce-
narios test selling excess heat directly to the district heating grid using a heat exchanger.
Simulations are conducted for each hydrogen market price listed in Table 1, focusing
on experiments unrelated to determining hydrogen prices. Simulations span from 2023
to at least 2026, utilizing available electricity price data. The simulations conclude at
the point of Return on Investment (RoI) determination, or by 2050 if no RoI is estab-
lished earlier. Table 2 details the setup for these experiments, e.g., experiment 1.1 is
Scenario 1 without excess heat sales, and 1.2 includes it.
For Scenario 3, parameters in Table 3 calculate the levelized cost of energy for the
onsite renewable energy park, thereby determining the LCoH. The MCDM evaluation
uses Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as operation hours, LCoH, hydrogen, and
heat production, revenues from hydrogen and heat, CO2 emissions, and profit to com-
pare experiments.

6 Results and discussions
6.1 Scenario results
All experimental results are outlined in Table 4. For scenario 1, experiments 1.1 and
1.2 show LCoH of 3.06 EUR/kg and 2.86 EUR/kg, respectively. The results indicate
that hydrogen prices of 1.5 and 2 EUR/kg are not profitable, although prices at 2.7
EUR/kg do yield short-term profits by excluding capital and maintenance costs from
calculations. The operations, averaging 8,709.75 hours annually over four years, pro-
duce 2,085.17 tons of hydrogen and approximately 14 tons of CO2 annually.

*If the cell is empty no Return on Investment time was found within the simulations years
(27 years).
The impact of selling excess heat on the Return on Investment (RoI) is significant,
decreasing the RoI period by about six years at a hydrogen price of 2.7 EUR/kg. The
smaller impact at 3.5 EUR/kg is due to the constant prices of excess heat, which dimin-
ishes its relative contribution to profits.
In scenario 2 (experiments 2.1 and 2.2), the business model employs a flexible pro-
duction strategy that adjusts to fluctuating electricity prices. Hydrogen prices signifi-
cantly influence the results due to the management of flexible operations. At the start
of the year, higher electricity prices result in a gradual decrease in operational hours, as
it is too expensive to produce hydrogen. This demands lower electricity prices in the
future production schedule to account for the increasing idle time. This operational
model directly impacts the LCoH, with reduced hydrogen production leading to higher
LCoH. Notably, at a hydrogen price of 2.7 EUR/kg, selling excess heat substantially
lowers the LCoH. Comparison with a higher price of 3.5 EUR/kg demonstrates that
flexible operations can enhance profitability without significantly affecting hydrogen
output.
Additionally, this paper applies an evolutionary optimization algorithm [33] in sce-
nario 2 to determine the most competitive fixed hydrogen price that minimizes LCoH,
ensuring production costs remain low without compromising profitability. It’s crucial
to recognize how hydrogen pricing affects the electrolyzer's operation. High spot prices
can still yield profits, but excessively high prices lead to costlier hydrogen production.
Ideally, the operation should occur at price points that maximize profitability and main-
tain low LCoH.
Results in Table 5 reveal that the optimal hydrogen production cost, adjusted for
electricity prices between 2015 and 2018, ranges from 3.50 EUR/kg without excess
heat to 3.30 EUR/kg with excess heat usage. Achieving these rates involves reducing
hydrogen production by approximately 12% from 2,085.17 tons to about 1,838 tons,
leveraging the flexibility of the electrolyzer. This adjustment, alongside selling excess
heat to the district heating grid, can decrease hydrogen costs by an additional 5.6%.
The established optimal fixed hydrogen price of 2.79 EUR/kg for 7,682 operational
hours annually does not limit the potential to sell hydrogen at higher prices but suggests
following this pricing strategy to achieve the lowest production costs.

In scenario 3 (experiments 3.1 and 3.2), the electrolyzer operates on renewable en-
ergy, with profits being influenced directly by hydrogen prices due to the dependency
on renewable output levels. The LCoH reaches 5.8 and 5.6 EUR/kg without and with
the sale of excess heat, respectively, as recorded in Table 4. The operation drastically
cuts operation hours by 71% compared to scenario 1, reflecting the renewable energy
park's insufficiency in maximizing electrolyzer capacity. This is further underscored by
the average wind speed of 3.9 m/s and solar radiation of 116.68 W/m², with wind tur-
bines and PV systems requiring 13 m/s and 1000 W/m², respectively, to reach peak
production [34] [35].
6.2 Multi-criteria decision-making results
The LCoH when compared to market rates, as shown in Table 4, indicates that the
green hydrogen produced falls within the competitive range of 4-6 EUR/kg, distin-
guishing it from the less expensive grey and blue hydrogen options [36]. KPIs such as
hydrogen price, LCoH, profit, hydrogen production, and emissions are used as decision
criteria in the MCDM evaluation, utilizing both Equal and Entropy weightings (Table
6 and Table 7). The MCDM rankings, displayed in Fig. 1, identify scenario 3.2 with a
hydrogen price of 3.5 EUR/kg as the most favorable, emphasizing zero emissions and
profit, and underscoring the importance of environmental considerations in the evalua-
tions.

The average rankings across all experiments highlight experiment 3.2 with a hydro-
gen price of 1.5 EUR/kg as the optimal choice under equal weighting. Differences be-
tween the lowest and highest hydrogen prices in the same experiment predominantly
affect profit rather than hydrogen price. The higher significance of profit changes, due
to normalization across all scenarios rather than just scenario 3, makes hydrogen price
more impactful in the evaluation. This observation suggests that equal weighting might
not be appropriate unless hydrogen price is specifically considered. Consequently, an
alternative weighting method has been applied.Multi-agent based modeling for investigating excess heat utilization 9

In the entropy-weighted MCDM evaluation, experiment 3.2 at 3.5 EUR/kg emerges
as the superior option. The VIKOR, TOPSIS, and PROMETHEE methods show com-
parable rankings, with significant variations only in PROMETHEE. The entropy
weightings reveal a strong emphasis on CO2 emissions and profit, particularly benefit-
ing scenario 3 where emissions are zero. Given the shift towards green hydrogen pro-
duction via electrolyzers rather than traditional methods reliant on natural gas, high
emissions weighting aligns with stakeholder interests, making the entropy weighting
method an appropriate choice for these evaluations.10 K. Christensen et al.

7 Conclusion
This paper explores the business feasibility of selling excess heat from an electro-
lyzer to district heating grids. By incorporating the sale of excess heat into three busi-
ness models, this study assessed their impact on the ecosystem using agent-based mod-
eling and three Multi-Criteria Decision-Making methods. The business models ana-
lyzed are constant hydrogen production; flexible production that adjusts to electricity
prices; and hydrogen production using renewable energy sources, with and without ex-
cess heat sales.
The case study is Greenlab in Skive, Denmark, demonstrating that selling excess
heat improves the economic viability of all models. Notably, the lowest hydrogen pro-
duction cost is 2.795 EUR/kg under flexible operations linked to electricity spot prices,
with excess heat sales and a fixed hydrogen price of 3.298 EUR/kg. However, achieving
this cost required reducing hydrogen production by 12% compared to continuous oper-
ations.
In terms of environmental impact, producing hydrogen from grid electricity indi-
rectly emits approximately 13,783.8 tons of CO2 over four years starting in 2023. The
most sustainable model proved to be hydrogen production from renewable sources
combined with excess heat sales, priced at 3.5 EUR/kg. However, the operational fea-
sibility of renewable sources is limited to 29% of potential hours due to weather condi-
tions and energy capacity, leading to a competitive cost of 5.76 EUR/kg for green hy-
drogen in the case study.
This paper provides valuable insights into producing competitively priced, 100%
green hydrogen using renewable energy facilities. Additionally, this paper outlines the
environmental considerations associated with hydrogen production from grid electric-
ity up to 2027.Multi-agent based modeling for investigating excess heat utilization 11
7.1 Limitations and future work
The existing simulation model primarily addresses the Power-to-Hydrogen ecosystem,
treating the district heating network as a straightforward heat demand and utilizing all
accessible excess heat. It also simplifies the operation of the electrolyzer to basic on/off
states, whereas in practice, it operates dynamically with an efficiency curve influenced
by power input. Future studies aim to enhance the model by integrating the Power-to-
Hydrogen process with the district heating network and incorporating dynamic electro-
lyzer operation. This will include adding the district heating business ecosystem to eval-
uate potential synergies between excess heat production and heating demand, poten-
tially requiring adjustments in electrolyzer operations. Furthermore, relevant stakehold-
ers within the electricity, hydrogen, and district heating market are being implemented
to obtain the ecosystem dynamics and utilize the benefits of multi-agent-based simula-
tion.
