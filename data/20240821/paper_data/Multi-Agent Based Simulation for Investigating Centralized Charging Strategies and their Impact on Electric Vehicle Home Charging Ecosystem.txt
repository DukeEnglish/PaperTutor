Abstract. This paper addresses the critical integration of electric vehicles (EVs)
into the electricity grid, essential for achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. The
rapid increase in EV adoption poses significant challenges to the existing grid
infrastructure, particularly in managing the increasing electricity demand and
mitigating the risk of grid overloads. Centralized EV charging strategies are in-
vestigated due to their potential to optimize grid stability and efficiency, com-
pared to decentralized approaches that may exacerbate grid stress. Utilizing a
multi-agent based simulation model, the study provides a realistic representation
of the electric vehicle home charging ecosystem in a case study of Strib, Den-
mark. The findings show that the Earliest-deadline-first and Round Robin per-
forms best with 100% EV adoption in terms of EV user satisfaction. The simula-
tion considers a realistic adoption curve, EV charging strategies, EV models, and
driving patterns to capture the full ecosystem dynamics over a long-term period
with high resolution (hourly). Additionally, the study offers detailed load profiles
for future distribution grids, demonstrating how centralized charging strategies
can efficiently manage grid loads and prevent overloads.

1 Introduction
The evolution of the traditional electricity grid into a Smart Grid involves the integra-
tion of digital energy solutions to tackle the challenges brought about by the move to-
wards carbon neutrality. This shift, in line with the European Union’s objective of
achieving a carbon-neutral society by 2050 [1], calls for the electrification of the
transport sector. The swift transition from conventional vehicles to Electric Vehicles
(EVs) is essential but requires a robust charging infrastructure to accommodate the
growing electricity needs [2].
EV charging infrastructure is typically concentrated in areas with robust electrical
grids, ensuring reliable access to power at large charging stations. However,2 K. Christensen et al.
Distribution System Operators (DSOs) do not possess the regulatory authority to dictate
whether individual residential consumers can install home charging stations. This reg-
ulatory gap poses a unique challenge, as DSOs are simultaneously tasked with guaran-
teeing high security of supply within a grid infrastructure originally designed for con-
ventional energy consumption, devoid of the additional demands from EVs, photovol-
taic systems, and heat pumps. Therefore, this paper focuses on home charging of EVs,
highlighting its critical importance and exploring the implications for residential grid
stability and energy management.
Digital solutions that exploit the flexibility of EV charging, such as intelligent EV
charging systems and smart chargers, can significantly cut down the costs related to the
integration of EVs into the electrical grids [3, 4]. Nevertheless, the increasing number
of EVs threatens to cause significant grid overloads under the existing conditions.
DSOs are faced with the decision of either expensive grid upgrades or the adoption of
dynamic tariff schemes that leverage energy flexibility to manage and potentially post-
pone these upgrades.
Research and interviews with Danish DSOs reveal the challenge of the unpredictable
outcomes of adopting EVs, and various charging strategies. These strategies aim to uti-
lize the flexibility of EVs, but the overall effects on all ecosystem stakeholders—in-
cluding DSOs and EV users—are not fully comprehended, making the strategic deci-
sions to prevent economic losses and unnecessary expenditures complex.
Moreover, the introduction of dynamic electricity pricing structures, such as Time-
of-Use tariffs and hourly electricity prices, is shaping consumers’ awareness and con-
sumption habits. These pricing models prompt consumers to be more mindful of their
electricity usage times and volumes, thereby adding a layer of complexity to EV charg-
ing, which goes beyond the simple act of plug-in and charging. Before 2021 in Den-
mark, many consumers adopted a basic plug-in and charge approach, primarily due to
a lack of awareness of dynamic pricing [5]. This strategy, known as traditional charg-
ing, is evolving post-2021 with the introduction of hourly price settlements, potentially
changing consumer behavior.
Furthermore, smart charging, as defined by [6] and [7], entails the intelligent control
of EV charging through connections between EVs, charging operators, and utility com-
panies enabled by data links. Several EV charging strategies are proposed in the litera-
ture, e.g., [8-11]. Popular decentralized strategies are investigated by [12], finding that
the investigated decentralized strategies induced earlier grid overloads compared to tra-
ditional charging. Decentralized charging strategies typically focus on EV users' pref-
erences, such as minimizing charging costs by responding to price signals like day-
ahead prices, which reflect overall grid conditions and encourage consumption during
periods of lower demand.
However, these price signals often fail to consider local grid conditions within the
distribution network, leading to synchronized charging behaviors that can overload lo-
cal grids. In contrast, centralized charging strategies aim to mitigate this issue by con-
trolling EV charging based on real-time local grid conditions. Despite the potential ben-
efits, the future loading profile resulting from the implementation of technologically
mature and user-friendly centralized charging strategies remains uncertain. These strat-
egies are not limited by regulatory constraints and cause minimal inconvenience to EVMulti-Agent Based Simulation for Investigating Centralized Charging Strategies 3
users, making them crucial for DSOs to manage the increasing electricity demand ef-
fectively. Furthermore, the impact of these strategies on various stakeholders within the
EV home charging ecosystem warrants comprehensive investigation. This paper ad-
dresses the urgent need to explore centralized EV charging strategies to enhance grid
stability and optimize resource allocation within local grids.
This paper investigates the impact of technologically mature and user-friendly cen-
tralized EV charging strategies, as identified by [13]. The strategies under consideration
include Round Robin, First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS), Equal Charge, and Earliest
Deadline First (EDF), all considered feasible due to their current use at charging sta-
tions [14]. Using a multi-agent-based simulation model, this study explores the dynam-
ics of these strategies in a case study involving 126 households in Strib, Denmark. This
simulation approach allows for the representation of the ecosystem through interacting
agents that mirror real-world interactions among ecosystem actors. By using real-world
data on EV adoption rates, vehicle models, driving patterns, and base consumption, the
simulation accurately reflects the EV home charging ecosystem [15]. The centralized
charging strategies are compared against traditional charging methods to assess their
impact on the ecosystem. The primary stakeholders examined in this paper are the Dis-
tribution System Operator (DSO) and EV users because the DSO is responsible for
maintaining grid stability, while EV users are directly affected by the charging strate-
gies.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: The Methodology section pre-
sents the multi-agent simulation framework, detailing the parameters and configura-
tions employed for modeling centralized EV charging strategies. This is followed by
the Case Study and Scenarios section, which applies these strategies within a specific
context. Next, the Results and Discussion section evaluates these strategies in compar-
ison to traditional charging methods. The paper concludes with the Conclusion section,
summarizing key findings and implications.
2 Methodology
To study the impact of introducing centralized EV charging strategies on the EV home
charging ecosystem, this paper developed a multi-agent-based simulation grounded in
the identified business ecosystem. A business ecosystem comprises market actors, ob-
jects, and their respective roles. The complexity of this ecosystem arises from interac-
tions between roles, including the flow of goods, monetary value, information, data,
and intangible value [16]. The ecosystem framework used in this study is based on the
EV home charging ecosystem identified by [17].
The translation to a multi-agent-based simulation follows the methodology pre-
sented in [18], where ecosystem actors and objects are converted into agents with roles
integrated through Java interfaces or abstract classes to ensure agents include the re-
sponsibilities and functionality of the assigned roles. This approach is essential because
analytical models are often inadequate for addressing complex problems characterized
by dynamic systems with non-linear behavior, memory effects, intricate variable inter-
dependencies, temporal factors, and cause-and-effect relationships [15]. Such4 K. Christensen et al.
properties render analytical models unsuitable for realistic energy ecosystems due to its
stochastic elements and events with different triggers such as time-based.
Agent-based modeling, chosen for this study, simulates the interactions of individual
agents to assess their effects on the system as a whole. This method allows for a detailed
and dynamic analysis of both the overall ecosystem (high abstraction) and the specific
behaviors of individual consumers and electric vehicles (low abstraction). This dual-
level analysis is particularly valuable for understanding the multifaceted nature of EV
home charging ecosystems and the impact of centralized charging strategies. Among
several agent-based modeling tools, the multi-method simulation tool – AnyLogic [19],
has been selected based on its application domains within power grids, business strat-
egy, and innovation analysis.
The agents found relevant to address for simulation experiments conducted in this
paper are the DSO, Charging box, EV, Domestic consumer, Charging service provider,
and centralized charging strategies which are modeled as agents for enhanced modu-
larity in the model. The logic of the different strategies is as follows:
• Round Robin: Charges EVs in intervals, e.g., an EV starts charging and exceeds
the maximum allowed number of simultaneous charging EVs. The newly ar-
rived EV will not charge before the next time interval starts. When the new
interval starts, the newly arrived EV will charge, and one of the already charging
EVs will stop charging. The next interval will then stop the charging at another
EV instead, and so it continues until the number of simultaneous charging EVs
is below the allowed limit [14].
• FCFS: Charges the EVs in the order they arrive. For instance, an EV arrives at
home and connects to the charging box which requests charging permission
from the centralized management system managed by the charging service pro-
vider. If the charging of the EV exceeds the capacity, the EV is put first in the
queue for charging when capacity is sufficient [20].
• Equal Charge: Shares the available capacity equally between all connected EVs
up to their maximum charging rate [14]. When the maximum charging rate of
all connected EVs exceeds the limit, the charging rate is reduced so that all EVs
charge at the same rate but with a total rate that is below the limit. The strategy
takes into account if EVs charge at different rates. For instance, this strategy
does not affect EVs charging with 3.7 kW if the capacity limit is satisfied by
reducing EVs with an 11 kW charging rate to anything higher than 3.7 kW.
• EDF: Charges always the EV with the earliest departure time first [10], with the
assumption that EV users provide their planned departure time.
3 Case study and simulation experiments
A case study of EV home charging in a distribution network in Strib, Denmark, con-
sisting of 126 households is used. The consumption data was supplied by the Danish
Distribution System Operator (DSO) TREFOR, which is responsible for this region.
The data utilized is solely for 2019, deliberately omitting the years 2020-2021 and 2022
which were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and the energy crisis due to the warMulti-Agent Based Simulation for Investigating Centralized Charging Strategies 5
between Russia and Ukraine, respectively. The case study’s low voltage electricity net-
work (400 V) is connected to a 0.4/10 kV transformer with a capacity of 400 kVA. This
system is simulated for residential households, with an expected power factor close to
one, and a transformer capacity of 400 kW. For simplicity, the transformer's capacity
is taken as the total capacity of the distribution network, disregarding the cables and
nodes within the network. The EV adoption is a Poisson process based on the adoption
curve estimated in [15] and shown in Fig. 1, achieving 100% adoption within 2039.
Fig. 1. Adoption curve (black) and electric vehicles adopted per year (green) [15].
The driving behavior is based on the consumption pattern found in the baseload.
When it comes to choosing specific EV models, the decision is made randomly, with
probabilities based on the popularity of the top five EV models in Denmark during
2019. More details are explained in [15].
To investigate the ecosystem impact of the proposed centralized strategies, 10 ex-
periments are designed and listed in Table 1. Each experiment is based on one of the
four centralized strategies (Round Robin, Equal Charge, FCFS, and EDF) with an
hourly electricity price scheme and fixed or dynamic distribution tariff. The Round
Robin strategy is the only dependent on a time interval between cycles, here 15 minutes
are chosen. To evaluate the effect of the centralized strategies, the traditional charging
strategy - i.e. charging immediately at arrival, is used as a baseline for comparison with
the centralized strategies.

The simulation was conducted from 2020 to 2032, as it was found in [12] that the
decentralized charging strategies induced overload within this period. However, for
each of the four centralized strategies, an additional experiment for 2036 until 2039 is
designed to investigate their impact on a system with 100% EV adoption. In 2032, 89-
98 EVs are adopted, corresponding to 71-78% adoption share. To evaluate the charging
strategies the following key performance indicators are chosen: Overloads the year after
the first overload; average charging cost of EV users; average total electricity bill (in-
cludes all electricity consumption) of all EV users; average total CO2 emissions from
consuming electricity; EV users’ dissatisfaction (i.e. desired charging level is not
reached); Load factor of the grid; and DSO revenue from distribution tariff alone. The
mentioned performance indicators are compared between the different strategies, in-
cluding the traditional charging, i.e. starting the charge at arrival.
4 Results
• Traditional charging
The results of traditional charging from 2020 to 2032 are presented in [15]. [15] does
not simulate the traditional charging strategy for 2036 to 2039. Therefore, to compare
the centralized strategies performance with 100% EV adoption, traditional charging is
simulated from 2036 to 2039.
Table 2 shows the key results for the traditional charging, from 2036 to the last sim-
ulation year (2039). Overload occurs on the first day of the simulation period, and over-
loads occur almost daily due to the 100% EV adoption.

number of dissatisfactions. Only users with a Nissan Leaf experience dissatisfaction
due to its low charging rate of 3.7 kW and situations when they arrive late with a low
state-of-charge and early departure. Except for the Equal Charge, for all centralized
strategies, the dissatisfaction is the same as for this experiment and will not be discussed
further.Multi-Agent Based Simulation for Investigating Centralized Charging Strategies 7

4.1 Round Robin Charging Strategy
The logic of the Round Robin charging strategy is to keep the total load below trans-
former capacity by not having more EVs charging than the grid can manage. The Round
Robin algorithm cycles the charging and non-charging queues for each time interval.
• Round Robin for 2020 to 2032

ing.

Besides the load factor, no real difference is found in applying the Round Robin
charging strategy to the system. It can be concluded that the Round Robin can be used
until the year 2032 to avoid overload and better utilize grid capacity (due to the in-
creased load factor) without affecting EV users.
Fig. 4 shows the total grid load from 2031 to 2032. The figure shows that the load
stays below the grid capacity. The dissatisfactions from the Round Robin strategy are
equal to the traditional charging.8 K. Christensen et al.

• Round Robin for 2036 to 2039
This experiment aims to test how the Round Robin charging strategy performs under
121 to 126 EVs in the grid (96-100% EV adoption). The relevant results of this exper-
iment are to see if this charging strategy can avoid overload with 100% EV adoption
and if any EV user (except the Nissan Leaf) experiences any dissatisfaction. The key
result for 2039 of this experiment is shown in Table 4 and compared with traditional
charging, from 2036 to 2039.

• Equal Charge for 2020 to 2032
Table 6 shows the results for the Equal Charge compared with the traditional charging.
The results show that, like the Round Robin, the Equal charge has no real impact on
the system except for the increased load factor. However, the DSO’s revenue is slightly
more affected than the Round Robin strategy.

Like the Round Robin, the equal charge avoids overload with a 100% EV adoption.
The Equal Charge performs the best on the EV users’ charging costs and electricity
bills. However, as shown in Fig. 5, it results in more dissatisfaction; ninety-seven dis-
satisfactions during 2039, 64% more than the traditional charging. For the EV users
(not owning a Nissan Leaf), the dissatisfaction happens mainly once, meaning that it
happens on rare occasions (none for Renault Zoe users). Therefore, users with fast-
charging EV models will benefit from the Equal Charge strategy. However, the Equal
Charge significantly impacts the DSO’s revenue with a reduction of almost 13%,
whereas the Round Robin is only a 0.39% reduction.10 K. Christensen et al.

4.3 First-Come-First-Serve Strategy
• First-Come-First-Serve for 2020 to 2032
Table 8 shows the experiment results for using FCFS with a comparison with traditional
charging.
The experiment results of using FCFS are very similar to the experiment results of
using Round Robin and Equal Charge strategies. However, the DSO’s revenue is less
affected than the Equal Charge strategy.

the traditional charging experiment are shown in Table 9. FCFS avoids overload with
a 100% EV adoption. The FCFS performs almost as well as Round Robin except for a
slight difference in user dissatisfaction (FCFS has one more) and the DSO revenue
(FCFS has around 38 DKK less).

The EDF is the only centralized strategy having the same number of dissatisfactions
as without any centralized strategies. The reason is that the users with the earliest de-
parture are prioritized and require that the algorithm knows when users are planning to
leave. Besides this, the EDF strategy performs slightly more poorly than the Round
Robin and FCFS in the other key results, except for the DSO’s revenue, where the EDF
performs slightly better.12 K. Christensen et al.
5 Discussion
The primary objective of centralized EV charging strategies is to prevent grid over-
loads. The results demonstrate that overloads can be effectively avoided with approxi-
mately 98 EVs in the grid until the end of 2032. Up to an 80% EV adoption rate, the
implementation of any of the four centralized strategies by the DSO or a third party
does not significantly affect EV users, assuming they follow traditional charging be-
haviors. This highlights the robustness of centralized strategies in managing increased
loads without compromising user satisfaction.
5.1 Example of Round Robin Strategy
Centralized strategies effectively manage EV charging without compromising user sat-
isfaction, as illustrated by the Round Robin strategy example. Fig. 6 shows the total
grid load for a day in 2032 experiencing overload under traditional charging and the
same day using the Round Robin strategy. The Round Robin strategy prevents over-
loads (e.g., on January 29 at 5 and 6 PM) without causing a significant load increase in
the following hours. This is because the simulation output is hourly-based, showing the
maximum load within each hour. Consequently, EVs are charged within the overload
hours, as the load does not increase in subsequent hours. Table 12 further supports this
by detailing the number of charging EVs and overload durations for traditional and
Round Robin charging experiments:
• At 5 PM, there are 18 minutes of overload within the hour, with a maximum
overload size of 74 kW. This implies that 42 minutes within the hour are free
from overload, indicating available capacity. However, due to the overload
size, it is not feasible to charge the same number of EVs within this hour using
the Round Robin strategy, resulting in seven fewer charging EVs.
• At 6 PM, the entire hour experiences overload, leaving no room for load shift-
ing. The Round Robin algorithm mitigates this by cycling new EVs to charge
every 15 minutes while others are turned off, avoiding overload with only
three fewer charging EVs.
• At 7 PM, no overload occurs, but the load is only 5 kW below grid capacity.
The Round Robin strategy continues to manage charging to avoid overload,
allowing two more EVs to charge during this hour.
• At 8 PM, the number of charging EVs remains consistent, suggesting that EVs
charge for a longer duration within this hour under the Round Robin strategy.
The number of charging EVs gradually increases by 1-2 for the next three
hours, eventually matching the traditional charging pattern from 12 AM on-
ward (hours after 12 AM are not shown as they are identical).
This example demonstrates that the Round Robin strategy only load-shifts a total of
seven charging EVs within whole hours. Due to the available capacity within hours,
other centralized strategies perform similarly, explaining the negligible impact on key
results. Additionally, the load factor is significantly increased by 23%, indicating that
grid capacity is utilized more efficiently with centralized strategies. This increase inMulti-Agent Based Simulation for Investigating Centralized Charging Strategies 13
load factor is consistent across all centralized strategies, making it challenging to de-
termine the superior strategy among them.

5.2 Assumptions and Practical Considerations
The centralized EV charging algorithms assume real-time knowledge of changes in
baseload. In our simulation, baseload information is updated simultaneously for both14 K. Christensen et al.
centralized strategy agents and consumer agents, implying no delay. However, in real-
ity, even a microsecond delay could result in an overload. Therefore, incorporating a
buffer within the algorithm, combined with AI-based load forecasting, is necessary.
The buffer can be determined using historical load data, allowing the algorithms to op-
erate at the transformer capacity minus the buffer.
It is important to note that the centralized EV charging strategies investigated in this
research are primarily designed for charging stations. Consequently, their practical ap-
plication in home charging systems may be limited. For example, the EDF strategy
might be unsuitable for distribution grids, as users could set early departure times to
gain charging priority (unless the centralized strategy is unknown to users). Addition-
ally, the fairness of centralized EV charging strategies for individual users (e.g., those
arriving late in FCFS or departing late in EDF, and those with low charging rates) war-
rants further investigation. Future research should explore how these strategies can be
adapted for home charging scenarios and assess their fairness and efficiency in diverse
real-world contexts.
6 Conclusion
The rapid increase in electric vehicle (EV) adoption poses significant challenges for
Distribution System Operators (DSOs) tasked with ensuring reliable electricity supply
through grids not originally designed for such loads. To address this issue without in-
curring substantial grid reinforcement costs, it is essential to explore cost-effective,
technologically mature and user-friendly centralized EV charging strategies that max-
imize the current grid capacity.
This paper investigates the effectiveness of centralized EV charging strategies—
Round Robin, First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS), Equal Charge, and Earliest Deadline
First (EDF)—in preventing grid overloads. By employing a multi-agent-based simula-
tion, the study models the EV home charging ecosystem with realistic adoption curves,
diverse charging strategies, various EV models, and driving patterns over a long-term
period with high temporal resolution (hourly).
The findings indicate that all examined centralized charging strategies successfully
prevent grid overloads, a critical consideration as traditional and decentralized strate-
gies often lead to earlier grid overloads. At an 80% EV adoption rate, centralized strat-
egies exhibit a minimal impact on user satisfaction. However, when EV adoption
reaches 100%, the EDF strategy proves most effective in minimizing user dissatisfac-
tion. Despite its efficacy, practical implementation of the EDF strategy could lead to
strategic manipulation by users, suggesting that the Round Robin strategy, which ranks
second in reducing dissatisfaction, may be a more pragmatic choice.
The study provides significant contributions by offering detailed future load profiles
of distribution grids under various centralized charging strategies, demonstrating their
practical viability in preventing grid overloads and maintaining user satisfaction. These
findings have profound practical implications, equipping DSOs with actionable strate-
gies to manage the increasing electricity demand due to EV adoption. By implementingMulti-Agent Based Simulation for Investigating Centralized Charging Strategies 15
these centralized strategies, DSOs can effectively defer costly grid reinforcements and
ensure a stable and reliable electricity supply.
The main limitation of the study is the assumption that users strictly adhere to pre-
defined charging behaviors, without accounting for potential behavioral adaptations
over time. Additionally, the focus on a specific geographic area and set of conditions
may limit the generalizability of the results. Future research should address these limi-
tations by incorporating adaptive user behaviors, exploring diverse geographic con-
texts, and considering the impact of regulatory changes. Moreover, examining the com-
bined effects of decentralized and centralized strategies will provide a more compre-
hensive understanding of their potential to optimize grid performance and user satis-
faction.
While centralized EV charging strategies show promise in preventing grid overloads
and improving grid capacity utilization, further research is needed to address practical
implementation challenges, user behavior adaptations, and the fairness of these strate-
gies across different user scenarios. This will ensure the development of robust, adapt-
able, and equitable solutions for managing the increasing electricity demand associated
with EV adoption.
