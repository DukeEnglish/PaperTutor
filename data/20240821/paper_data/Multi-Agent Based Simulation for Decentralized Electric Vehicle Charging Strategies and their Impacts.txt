Abstract. The growing shift towards a Smart Grid involves integrating numerous
new digital energy solutions into the energy ecosystems to address problems aris-
ing from the transition to carbon neutrality, particularly in linking the electricity
and transportation sectors. Yet, this shift brings challenges due to mass electric
vehicle adoption and the lack of methods to adequately assess various EV charg-
ing algorithms and their ecosystem impacts. This paper introduces a multi-agent
based simulation model, validated through a case study of a Danish radial distri-
bution network serving 126 households. The study reveals that traditional charg-
ing leads to grid overload by 2031 at 67% EV penetration, while decentralized
strategies like Real-Time Pricing could cause overloads as early as 2028. The
developed multi-agent based simulation demonstrates its ability to offer detailed,
hourly analysis of future load profiles in distribution grids, and therefore, can be
applied to other prospective scenarios in similar energy systems.
Keywords: multi-agent based simulation, multi-agent systems, agent-based
modeling, electric vehicle, charging strategies.
1 Introduction
The transformation of the electricity grid into a Smart Grid integrates digital energy
solutions designed to address the challenges posed by the shift towards carbon neutral-
ity. This transition, aligned with the European Union's goal for a carbon-neutral society
by 2050 [1], necessitates the electrification of the transportation sector. The rapid re-
placement of conventional vehicles with Electric Vehicles (EVs) is critical but demands
an enhanced charging infrastructure to meet the increased electricity requirements [2].
Yet, existing grids are currently ill-equipped for this surge, presenting significant chal-
lenges.
Digital solutions that leverage EV charging flexibility, such as smart EV charging
systems and intelligent chargers, can significantly reduce the costs associated with in-
tegrating EVs into the electrical grids [3, 4]. However, the rising number of EVs risks
causing substantial grid overloads under existing conditions. Distribution System Op-
erators (DSOs) must choose between costly grid upgrades or adopting dynamic tariff
schemes that utilize energy flexibility to manage and potentially delay these upgrades.
The literature and interviews with DSOs in Denmark highlight three main challenges
associated with the rise of EVs and their charging in distribution grids: the unclear im-
pacts of implementing Dynamic Distribution Tariffs (DDTs) with increasing numbers
of EVs [5, 6], and the unpredictable consequences of adopting EVs, DDTs, and various2 Anonymized
charging strategies. These strategies aim to harness the flexibility of EVs, yet the com-
prehensive effects on all ecosystem stakeholders—including DSOs, EV users, and ser-
vice providers—are not fully understood, complicating the strategic decisions needed
to prevent economic losses and avoid unnecessary expenditures.
Additionally, the adoption of dynamic electricity pricing structures, such as Time-
of-Use tariffs and hourly electricity prices, is influencing end-consumers’ awareness
and consumption patterns. These pricing models encourage consumers to be more con-
scious of their electricity usage times and volumes, thus adding complexity to EV
charging, which transcends the simple act of plug-in and charging. Prior to 2021 in
Denmark, many consumers employed a straightforward plug-in and charge approach,
largely due to a lack of awareness of dynamic pricing [7]. This strategy, referred to as
Traditional charging, is evolving post-2021 with the availability of hourly price settle-
ments, potentially altering consumer behavior.
Furthermore, Smart charging, as defined by [8] and [9], involves the intelligent man-
agement of EV charging through connections between EVs, charging operators, and
utility companies facilitated by data links. This paper categorizes charging strategies
based on their control architecture, data requirements, and charger intelligence. Several
EV charging algorithms are proposed in the literature, e.g., [10-13], however, according
to a feasibility evaluation [14], the short-term feasible decentralized EV charging strat-
egies identified include Time-of-Use (ToU) Pricing, Real-Time Pricing (RTP), and
Timed charging, the latter often managed via smartphone apps but not considered
"smart" in simpler implementations.
This study utilizes a multi-agent based simulation model to explore these dynamics
in a case study of Strib, Denmark, with 126 households. The simulation aims to realis-
tically represent the EV home charging ecosystem, informed by real-world data on EV
adoption rates, vehicle models, driving patterns, and baseline consumption.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: The Methodology section pre-
sents the multi-agent simulation framework, detailing the parameters and configura-
tions employed for modeling decentralized EV charging strategies. This is followed by
the Case Study and Scenarios section, which applies these strategies within a specific
context. Next, the Results and Discussion section evaluates these strategies in compar-
ison to traditional charging methods. The paper concludes with the Conclusion section,
summarizing key findings and implications.
2 Methodology
This paper begins by analyzing the components of the EV home charging ecosystem—
actors, objects, roles, and interactions—using the business ecosystem architecture for
EV home charging as outlined in [15]. It then details how these elements are integrated
into a multi-agent based simulation, following the methodology described in [16]. The
process of translating actors, roles, and interactions into agents, interfaces, and agent
communications within the model architecture is elucidated. This simulation is devel-
oped using the multi-method simulation tool, AnyLogic.Multi-Agent Based Simulation for Decentralized Electric Vehicle Charging Strategies 3
2.1 Agent Types
The agents represent actors and objects in the ecosystem. The interaction in the business
ecosystem is between roles. Therefore, the roles are represented by Java interfaces hold-
ing the interactions related to the role. The agents implement the respective interfaces
corresponding to the actor/object and the associated roles.
The selected charging strategies (RTP and ToU Pricing) are implemented into the
simulation model developed in the software AnyLogic. This section introduces and ex-
plains the content of all agent roles relevant to the controlled charging of the EV. That
includes the agents and interfaces shown in Table 1. The decentralized charging strat-
egy agents are located at the ChargingServiceProvider, whereas, in reality, decentral-
ized logics/algorithms are located at the individual charging controls. This design is
selected for modeling convenience and simulation performance, as locating them at the
ChargingBox agents would result in many of the same agents performing the same ac-
tions. This design, instead, locates the logic in one place (ChargingServiceProvider
agent) for all ChargingBox agents to call its functions to receive charging schedules.

2.2 Agent Logic
Real-Time Pricing. The RTP strategy agent is named “RealTimePricing” in the model
and is referred to as the RTP agent in this research. The RTP strategy algorithm’s logic
is shown in Fig. 1. The green square represents the logic located within the RTP agent.
The blue square represents the algorithm’s required input from the EV and/or EV user.4 Anonymized
Time-of-Use Pricing. The ToU Pricing charging strategy agent is named “ToUPricing”
in the model. The logic for this agent is identical to the RTP, except that instead of the
day-ahead hourly electricity price, the ToU logic uses the tariff schedule from the elec-
tricity supplier (#5 in Fig. 1). When prices are sorted by the lowest price first, the sec-
ond sorting condition is the time (e.g., if only one hour of charge is needed within the
cheapest period, the schedule will contain the first hour in the period).

The logic flow is illustrated in Fig. 1 as a flowchart:
(#1 in Fig. 1) The charging with the RTP algorithm starts by plugging the EV into the
charging box.
(#2) The charging box agent sends a request for a charging schedule to the RTP agent.
(#3) The request includes the information seen in the blue box. The EV information is
stored in local variables in the RTP agent.
(#4-5) The RTP algorithm uses day-ahead forecast prices for deciding charging times.
The day-ahead prices are collected from the electricity supplier agent and stored in a
local list.Multi-Agent Based Simulation for Decentralized Electric Vehicle Charging Strategies 5
(#6) The hours when the EV is not at home (known based on the departure time) are
removed from the price forecast list.
(#7) The list with prices and corresponding times is sorted in ascending order, i.e., the
lowest price first.

charging schedule (charging if the time is in the schedule) until the desired SoC is
reached and it is time for departure.
3 Case Study and Scenarios
3.1 Case Introduction
This study focuses on a distribution grid in Strib, Denmark, serving 126 residential
consumers. The Danish DSO TREFOR, which operates in this area, provided the con-
sumption data. Only data from 2019 is used, excluding the COVID-19 impacted years
of 2020 and 2021. After cleaning the data to remove households with EVs, PVs, heat
pumps, electric heating, and missing data points, the final dataset covers 97 residents.
To maintain the study's scale at 126 households, additional data from 29 randomly se-
lected residents in Nr. Bjert was added. This adjusted dataset, free from distributed en-
ergy resources like heat pumps, helps simulate typical consumer consumption patterns,
detailed in [16].
3.2 Scenarios and Simulation Data Input
The paper evaluates the ecosystem impacts of decentralized EV charging strategies,
particularly comparing Real-Time Pricing (RTP) and Time-of-Use (ToU) Pricing6 Anonymized
against traditional charging schemes. The scenario relies on an adoption curve and elec-
tricity prices drawn from historical data and hourly price schemes under the DDT—
Tariff Model 3.0. Various experiments are designed to test the effects of RTP and ToU
Pricing, outlined in Table 2.
Simulation inputs include EV models, CO2 emissions, and driving patterns (depar-
ture, arrival, and distance traveled). The electricity pricing data, based on hourly spot
prices from the Nordpool market for 2015-2018, supports the simulation's hourly reso-
lution. As of January 1, 2023, TREFOR and eight other DSOs transitioned to Tariff
Model 3.0, which features four distinct tariff periods year-round, replacing the simpler
winter-only high-tariff model [17]. The analysis in [18] identifies Time-of-Use Pricing
as the most feasible DDT for the Danish system, informed by a comprehensive assess-
ment of 16 unique tariffs considering technical, economic, social, and regulatory fac-
tors.

4 Results and discussion
The following sections show the key results and relevant figures for each distinct strat-
egy and its associated experiments. The experiments are compared to the Traditional
charging strategy with their respective electricity price structure setup. For instance,
strategies employing an hourly electricity price scheme and TM3 are compared with
the “Tariff Model 3.0 and Hourly Electricity Price Scheme”.
4.1 Real-Time Pricing Scenario results
The Real-Time Pricing (RTP) charging strategy, by default, charges EVs during the
cheapest hours between arrival and departure. Table 3 summarizes the key results from
the experiments comparing the RTP strategy with Tariff Model 3.0 (TM3) to traditional
charging methods.Multi-Agent Based Simulation for Decentralized Electric Vehicle Charging Strategies 7

The results show that the implementation of TM3 would increase the incentives for
the users to adopt the RTP strategy and decrease the DSO’s tariff revenue. The EV
users’ costs can be reduced with RTP and the TM3 compared to without TM3. At the
same time, the tariff revenue is significantly reduced with an increase in overloads. The
results show that the RTP with TM3 is not good for the DSO to avoid grid overloads.
Fig. 2 shows the system details for the day with the first overload. The figure shows
that the total electricity price during the night becomes the cheapest due to the TM3.
Meanwhile, the RTP algorithm selects the cheapest hours.

The experiment of Real-Time Pricing – Distance optimization with minimum State-of-
Charge of 20%” explores the effects of charging EVs according to the distance of the
upcoming trip while maintaining a minimum SoC of 20%. Regardless of the short dis-
tances planned, the EVs are charged to achieve an SoC that is 20% higher than needed
for the planned trip, ensuring a minimum SoC of 20% at all times. This approach, sim-
ilar to maintaining a maximum SoC of 80%, aims to prolong battery life and prepare
for emergency needs.
The results indicate that using the Real-Time Pricing (RTP) algorithm with this strat-
egy lowers the total electricity bill but slightly increases the average charging cost com-
pared to the standard RTP approach. Notably, the first grid overload is delayed by about
11 months, and there are five fewer overloads in the following year compared to the
standard RTP. Additionally, this strategy allows the grid to manage 12 more EVs before
reaching overload.
This method also decreases EV user dissatisfaction by 24 events compared to the
standard RTP. However, despite these improvements, users of certain models like the
Nissan Leaf continue to experience dissatisfaction with the RTP strategy when distance
optimization is employed, mainly due to the insufficiency of the SoC for unexpected
longer trips the following day.
4.2 Time-of-Use Pricing scenario results
The Time-of-Use (ToU) Pricing strategy, tested with configurations including an 80%
maximum SoC and a distance optimization with a 20% minimum SoC, demonstrates
financial performance comparable to Real-Time Pricing (RTP) but with quicker yet less
frequent overloads. Table 4 provides a comparison of these results against traditional
charging methods.
The ToU strategy results in earlier overloads in 2029 compared to 2031 for
traditional charging, but experiences fewer subsequent overloads when employing
distance optimization. Financially, all ToU experiments reduce the average charging
cost by about 12.6% and electricity bills by up to 11.59%, while significantly reducing
CO2 emissions. The distance optimization strategy with a 20% minimum SoC shows
the best performance in terms of delaying the first overload, handling more EVs on the
grid, and improving load factors. While overall dissatisfaction increases under ToU
strategies, it decreases significantly by 61.90% when using the 80% SoC strategy.

The ToU Pricing charging strategy’s logic starts charging at the beginning of the
cheapest ToU period (in the period of which the EV is connected to the charger). If the
ToU Pricing has one long cheap period, for instance, during the night, then the ToU
Pricing strategy’s logic will start charging the EV in the first hour of this period. The
ToU Pricing strategy does not consider the raw electricity price as the logic is designed
for an unkown electricity price scheme but with ToU tariffs.
For both summer and winter periods in the TM3, the cheapest period starts at
midnight. Fig. 3 shows how all the EVs are charging from midnight, following the
logic. Notice in Fig. 3 that there is one EV charging at 9 PM. This is because there are
not enough hours in the cheapest period to satisfy its charging needs. Therefore, the EV
charges the first hour of the second cheapest period, which would be 9 PM.
Fig. 3. Visualization of details on the day with the first grid overload (with the Time-of-Use
Pricing charging strategy and Tariff Model 3.0).
For the ToU Pricing, as well as the RTP, EV users experience 17 events of more dis-
satisfaction compared to the baseline scenario. All dissatisfactions are only by Nissan10 Anonymized
Leaf users. The RTP and ToU Pricing experience more dissatisfaction for Nissan leaf
EV users because the algorithms for RTP and ToU Pricing calculate the charging sched-
ule for the available hours. The algorithms currently use whole hours, meaning that the
periods (from the EV arrives to the first full hour) are not used for charging, and the
hours the EV departs are also not used in the charging schedule. If the EV’s SoC is not
satisfied after the last hour in the schedule, the EV will continue charging (without
considering the cost) until it is satisfied or the EV departs. Therefore, this induces ad-
ditional dissatisfaction for the Nissan leaf users as the extra charging within the arrival
hour for the Traditional charging is often sufficient to satisfy the maximum SoC.
The realization of the algorithms in the research is based on the interpretation of the
algorithm logic’s description in the literature. In reality, the implementation of the al-
gorithms should consider all available time. Therefore, further research should consider
a better logic to improve the algorithms.
5 Conclusion
The increased adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) presents substantial challenges for
Distribution System Operators (DSOs) in maintaining high security of supply without
significant investments in grid reinforcement. This research demonstrates the potential
of activating consumer flexibility through tariff schemes as a cost-efficient strategy for
DSOs to manage increased demand.
This research applies decentralized EV charging strategies within a multi-agent sim-
ulation of an EV home charging ecosystem to explore the impacts from 2020 to 2032
at an hourly resolution. The results indicate that current electricity distribution grids are
not equipped to handle the rising load from EVs without control measures. Traditional
charging strategies lead to grid overloads by 2031 with 67% EV penetration, while the
adoption of intelligent charging strategies like Real-Time Pricing (RTP) could precipi-
tate these overloads as early as 2028.
This research addresses the research gap regarding the aggregated consequences of
adopting EVs, Dynamic Distribution Tariffs (DDTs), and various charging strategies.
The multi-agent based simulation developed in this research proves valuable for ex-
ploring other future and hypothetical scenarios in similar energy ecosystems.
Practically, the simulation model offers significant insights for stakeholders within
the energy ecosystem. For instance, DSOs can utilize the model to assess load profiles
on transformers and understand tariff revenue implications under different EV adoption
curves and charging strategies. Specifically, the results suggest that Danish DSOs
should reconsider the deployment of Tariff Model 3.0 if a high adoption of the RTP
charging strategy is observed to better align their operational strategies with the evolv-
ing grid demands. For EV users, this model facilitates the evaluation of different EV
charging programs offered by service providers, enhancing their decision-making pro-
cess in selecting optimal charging strategies. Policymakers can leverage the findings to
assess the impact of new regulations on the energy ecosystem and explore adjustments
to tariff designs that could foster more effective and sustainable energy distribution
systems.Multi-Agent Based Simulation for Decentralized Electric Vehicle Charging Strategies 11
Future research could consider investigating the effects of fluctuating electricity
prices, particularly on industrial energy consumers. Additionally, as Tariff Model 3.0
is anticipated to reduce tariff revenue and increase overload frequency, further studies
could explore the implications of centralized charging strategies and the potential need
for grid extensions prior to 2030. This will aid in preparing for a transition that accom-
modates the rapid increase in EV adoption without compromising grid stability.
