Abstract 7
Although the spread of behaviors is influenced by many social factors, existing 8
literature tends to study the effects of single factors—most often, properties of the 9
social network—on the final cascade. In order to move towards a more integrated 10
view of cascades, this paper offers the first comprehensive investigation into the 11
role of two social factors in the diffusion of 1,337 popular hashtags representing the 12
productionofnovelcultureonTwitter: 1)thetopologyoftheTwittersocialnetwork 13
and 2) performance of each user’s probable demographic identity. Here, we show 14
that cascades are best modeled using a combination of network and identity, rather 15
than either factor alone. This combined model best reproduces a composite index 16
of ten cascade properties across all 1,337 hashtags. However, there is important 17
heterogeneity in what social factors are required to reproduce different properties 18
of hashtag cascades. For instance, while a combined network+identity model best 19
predicts the popularity of cascades, a network-only model has better performance 20
in predicting cascade growth and an identity-only model in adopter composition. 21
We are able to predict what type of hashtag is best modeled by each combination 22
of features and use this to further improve performance. Additionally, consistent 23
withpriorliteratureonthecombinednetwork+identitymodelmostoutperformsthe 24
single-factor counterfactuals among hashtags used for expressing racial or regional 25
identity, stance-taking, talking about sports, or variants of existing cultural trends 26
with very slow- or fast-growing communicative need. In sum, our results imply the 27
utility of multi-factor models in predicting cascades, in order to account for the 28
varied ways in which network, identity, and other social factors play a role in the 29
diffusion of hashtags on Twitter. 30

33
Roughly 1 in 5 posts on Twitter (now known as X) contain hashtags. The ubiquity of
34
hashtags likely stems from their pragmatic and social functions in the process of cultural
35
production on Twitter: 1) to facilitate and codify the creation of new culture and 2) to
36
enableeasydisseminationofnewculturethatisproduced(BrunsundBurgess,2011,2015;
37
Rambukkana, 2015; La Rocca, 2020). As such, modeling the spread of cultural innovation
38
on Twitter requires a strong mechanistic understanding of how hashtags spread among
39
users on the platform, as well as the diverse mechanisms underlying the creation and
40
adoption of hashtags.
41
The spread of behaviors, known as cascades, has been primarily studied through the
42
lens of social networks, including analyzing the effects of different network topologies
43
and contagion processes Kupavskii u.a. (2012); Krishnan u.a. (2016); Pramanik u.a.
44
(2017), or how these effects vary by properties like the hashtag’s topic and semantics
45
Romero u.a. (2011); Lehmann u.a. (2012). Prior work suggests that many types of
46
social context help in shaping how far, how fast, and to whom artifacts diffuse (Chang,
47
2010; Lehmann u.a., 2012; Eisenstein u.a., 2014; Zhang u.a., 2016a; Goel u.a., 2016a;
48
Li u.a., 2018). For instance, hashtags are often used to explicitly signal the user’s social
49
identity or affiliation (Berger, 2008; Smith und Smith, 2012; Evans, 2016; Barron und
50
Bollen, 2022); in these cases, the Twitter network afford users exposure to the hashtag,
51
but each user’s identity helps determine whether they adopt the hashtag and, therefore,
52
also shapes future exposures (Palloni, 2001; Sharma, 2013; Merle u.a., 2019; Mueller
53
u.a., 2021). For example, Sharma (2013) theorizes that the spread of hashtags on Black
54
Twitter is driven by a combination of network and identity. Users coin these hashtags
55
to “perform” their racial identity online. Adopters are often part of the Black Twitter
56
network and, as such, continued adoption largely occurs within this community because
57
1) these users are more likely to be exposed to the hashtag, 2) exposed users outside the
58
communitytendnottoadoptthehashtagifitdoesnotsignaltheirracialidentity, which3)
59
minimizes exposure and adoption outside the community. As this example illustrates, the
60
dynamics underlying network-only diffusion likely differ from the dynamics when diffusion
61
involves a combination of network and other social factors like identity. As such, models
62
of hashtag dissemination would likely benefit from including multiple interacting social
63
factors. However, even in the context of studying identity-related hashtags, prior work
64
has largely focused on the impact of a single factor (e.g., either network or identity) when
65
modeling the diffusion of hashtags.
66
In this work, we investigate the role of two social factors in the adoption of innovation:
67
1) the topology of Twitter’s social network and 2) the probable demographic identity of
68
users. We study the spread of 1,337 popular hashtags, in a network of nearly 3M users
69
on Twitter. These hashtags represent the production of novel culture (e.g., #learnlife,
70
#gocavs). In order to compare the effects of network and identity, we simulate the dif-
71
2fusion of each hashtag using: 1) a Network-only model where hashtags spread through
72
the Twitter network using a modified linear-threshold model 2) an Identity-only model
73
where hashtags diffuse between users who share relevant identities, and 3) a combined
74
Network+Identity model that includes both social factors. We evaluate how well these
75
models reproduce ten commonly studied properties of cascades, including their popular-
76
ity, growth, and adopter composition. Overall, network and identity best reproduce a
77
composite measure of all ten properties. However, there is important heterogeneity in the
78
role of network and identity; for instance, hashtags regional or racial identity, and those
79
discussing sports or news have highest comparative advantage with the Network+Identity
80
model. We create a better-performing customized model, selecting whether to study each
81
hashtag using either network alone, identity alone, or network and identity together. Our
82
work underscores the importance of building models that integrate multiple social factors.
83
2. Related Work
84
2.1 Modeling Cultural Diffusion Online.
85
The diffusion of behavior and information online is a topic of significant study in the
86
literature. cf. Zhou u.a. (2021), Li u.a. (2021) and Raponi u.a. (2022) for recent re-
87
views of this literature. Some key points from these reviews: Empirical models often
88
aim to predict some property of the final cascade given some information about its ini-
89
tial adopters. Many such papers adapt models developed to simulate offline behaviors
90
from first principles, including the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) compartment
91
model, the linear threshold model of complex contagion, and stochastic simulations like
92
Hawkes models or Poisson processes. Other papers use deep learning for the predictive
93
task, including graph representation learning and predictive models from features of the
94
network, adopters, and early parts of the cascade. Our work builds on these studies by
95
using a more recent agent-based model of diffusion that accounts for diffusion dynamics
96
particular to Twitter. For instance, by adopting a usage-based instead of adopter-based
97
model, our framework accounts for frequency effects in the adoption (Ellis, 2002; Beckner
98
u.a., 2009); and by modeling the fading of attention online our model allows for cultural
99
artifacts to stop being used over time (e.g., to model hashtags that are used temporar-
100
ily and then exit the lexicon) Bruns und Burgess (2011). Using a first-principles model
101
also allows us to test the specific mechanisms associated with network and identity that
102
are encoded in the model – and to explicitly test the effects of network and identity in
103
cultural diffusion rather than simply using network or identity features in our model. We
104
also introduce a novel dataset of hashtag cascades and an ten-factor evaluation framework
105
to support future work in this area.
106
32.2 Social Factors in the Adoption of Hashtags.
107
Prior work often attributes hashtag adoption to factors related to network, identity, li-
108
fecycle, discourse. Network factors include the position of initial adopters in the social
109
network and simulating the diffusion of innovation through a social network (Li u.a.,
110
2021; Fink u.a., 2016). Identity factors include wanting to join or signal membership to a
111
certain community Raponi u.a. (2022); Page (2012); Yang u.a. (2012). Lifecycle factors
112
include the hashtag’s growth trajectory Cheng u.a. (2014); Fink u.a. (2016); Lin u.a.
113
(2013) Discursive factors include the hashtag’s relevance, topicality, and ease of use (e.g.,
114
length)Yangu.a.(2012);Finku.a.(2016);Linu.a.(2013);Cunhau.a.(2011);Giaxoglou
115
(2018). In addition to individual social factors, some theoretical models of diffusion posit
116
that the interaction of multiple social factors may play a role in the diffusion of hashtags.
117
For instance, qualitative studies of sports hashtags Smith und Smith (2012) and racial
118
hashtags Sharma (2013) have suggested that hashtags pertaining to specific communities
119
on Twitter may spread via network effects (someone is exposed to a hashtag, a precursor
120
for adoption, when a member of their network uses it) and identity effects (an exposed
121
user chooses to use the hashtag if they are a member of this community and want to
122
signal this identity). However, most empirical models do not incorporate the interaction
123
of network and identity. For instance, Raponi u.a. (2022) notes a number of articles that,
124
separately, describe the effect of “network factors” and “user factors” (e.g., identity) on
125
the propagation of misinformation, but none that describe the effects of both network and
126
userfactors. Similarly, Zhouu.a.(2021)listsseveralpapersthatmodeladoptiondecisions
127
based on either “neighboring relations” (i.e., the network) or “individual/group character-
128
istics” (like identity), but not both, while Kwon und Ha (2023) describes hashtags as
129
being either “identity-based” or “bond-based.” Our work builds in this prior literature by
130
empiricallymodelingtheinteractionoftwosocialfactors, networkandidentity, incultural
131
diffusion. In addition, we explore the conditions under which the interaction of these two
132
social factors is especially important in modeling the diffusion, and propose a combined
133
model to predict which factors (network and/or identity) best model the properties of a
134
given hashtag’s cascade.
135
3. Methods
136
In order to test the roles of network and identity in the diffusion of hashtags, we 1) collect
137
cascades of popular hashtags from Twitter, 2) estimate the identity of each user and the
138
network among the users, and 3) use an agent-based model to simulate these cascades us-
139
ingbothnetworkandidentity. Todothis, weadaptthemethodsofAnanthasubramaniam
140
u.a. (2024). We summarize all key points of the methods in this section, and the original
141
paper has full details.
142
43.1 Modeling Diffusion of Innovation
143
Testing our study’s hypotheses requires comparing empirical cascades against cascades
144
simulated using the Twitter network and users’ demographic identities. In this section,
145
we describe how we produce the needed synthetic data.
146
3.1.1 Simulation Formalism
147
The diffusion of hashtags on Twitter is modeled using a common agent-based setup: a set
148
of initial adopters use the hashtag at time t = 0; and at each subsequent timestep, each
149
agent will decide whether to use the hashtag depending on prior adoption by other agents.
150
In the popular linear threshold model, an agent will use the hashtag if the (weighted)
151
fraction of their network neighbors who are already adopters crosses a certain threshold
152
(Centola und Macy, 2007). To better simulate the dynamics underlying cultural produc-
153
tion, Ananthasubramaniam u.a. (2024) adapts the classic linear threshold model in two
154
ways that are well-suited for our research question:
155
First, adoption is usage-based rather than user-based. That is, rather than repres-
156
enting adoption as a binary property of the agent (i.e., an agent is either “an adopter” or
157
“not an adopter”), each exposed agent i could use the hashtag h at each timestep with
158
some time-varying probability p . Therefore, unlike the linear threshold model, an agent
ih 159
can 1) use the hashtag multiple times, or 2) decide not to use it in one timestep but then
160
decide to use it later. This assumption is consistent with the role of repeated exposure in
161
the adoption of textual innovation (Tomasello, 2000; Ellis, 2019).
162
Second, themodelusesnotonlythetopologyofthesocialnetworkbutalsotheidentity
163
of agents to model the diffusion of innovation. As shown in Equation 1, the probability
164
of an agent i’s adoption of hashtag h p is proportional to (i) the similarity between
ih 165
their identity and the hashtag’s identity δ ; and (ii) the fraction of their neighbors j who
ih 166
adopted the hashtag, weighted by tie strength w and similarity in identity δ .

Therefore, consistent with prior work on adoption of innovation (Centola und Macy,
168
2007; Bakshy u.a., 2012), the network influences 1) the hashtags an agent is exposed
169
to (opportunity to adopt) and 2) the agents’ level of exposure (likelihood of adopting).
170
Consistent with prior work on identity performance and signalling (Goffman u.a., 1978;
171
Eckert, 2012), the effects of identity are modeled in two ways: 1) agents preferentially
172
use hashtags that match their own identity, and 2) agents give higher weight to exposure
173
from demographically similar network neighbors.
174
53.1.2 Model Parameters
175
Each hashtag has a different propensity to be used on Twitter, due to differences in factors
176
like the size of potential audience, communicative need, and novelty (e.g., a hashtag about
177
a TV show with a small audience is likely to get fewer uses than a hashtag about a
178
TV show with a large audience) Bakshy u.a. (2011); Sharma (2013). Accordingly, in
179
Equation 1, each hashtag is associated with a different constant of proportionality S.
180
The S parameter is termed stickiness because larger values of this parameter bias the
181
model towards higher levels of—or “stickier”—adoption. The stickiness of each hashtag is
182
calibrated to the empirical cascade size (number of uses) using a nested grid search on a
183
parameter space of [0.1,1]: first, identifying the interval of width 0.1 in which the model
184
best approximates the empirical cascade size; and second, identifying the best fitting
185
stickiness value in that interval using a grid search with step size 0.01. Grid searches are
186
performed using one run of the model at each value of stickiness.
187
The model has three hyperparameters that apply across all hashtags. These are taken
188
from the original paper, which tuned the parameters to the empirical cascade size with
189
the same set of users.
190
3.1.3 Comparing Network and Identity
191
To understand the effects of network and identity, we compare the full Network+Identity
192
model described above against two counterfactuals: 1) the Network-only model, where
193
we simulate the spread of the word through just the network with no identity effects
194
(this is achieved by setting δ = 1 and δ = 1) and 2) the Identity-only model, where
ij ih 195
we eliminate the effects of homophily by running simulations on a configuration model
196
random graph with the same users and degree distribution as the original network.
197
3.2 Network and Identity Estimation
198
This section elaborates on how network and identity are estimated. Each agent in this
199
model is a user on Twitter who is likely located in U.S.A., based on the geographic
200
coordinates tagged on their tweets (Compton u.a., 2014). There are 3,959,711 such users
201
intheTwitterDecahose, a10%sampleoftweetsfrom2012to2022. Sinceweusethesame
202
agent identities and network to model the diffusion of all hashtags during this ten-year
203
period, the network and identities are inferred from 2018 data, which is at the midpoint
204
of this timeframe (e.g., identities are from the 2018 American Community Survey and
205
House of Representative elections, the network is inferred from interactions between 2012
206
and 2018).
207
3.2.1 Agent Identities
208
In this model, identity includes an agent’s affiliations towards 25 identities within five
209
demographic categories: (i) race/ethnicity (identities include different racial and ethnic
210
6groups such as non-Hispanic white, Black/African American, etc.), (ii) socioeconomic
211
status (identities include categories of income level, educational attainment, and labor-
212
force status); (iii) languages spoken (identities include the top six languages spoken in
213
U.S.A.: English, Spanish, French, Chinese, Vietnamese, Tagalog); (iv) political affiliation
214
(identities are Democrat, Republican, or Other Party); and (v) geographic location. Each
215
agent’s demographic identity is modeled as a vector Υ ∈ [0,1]25 whose entries represent
216
the composition of the user’s Census tract and Congressional district. An agent’s location
217
is inferred using the geographic coordinates they tweeted from, using the high-precision
218
algorithm from Compton u.a. (2014). An agent’s political affiliation is the fraction of
219
votes each party got in the agent’s Congressional district during the 2018 House of Rep-
220
resentatives election. An agent’s race, socioeconomic status, and languages spoken are
221
the fraction of the Census tract with the corresponding identity.
222
3.2.2 Network
223
This study uses a weighted Twitter mutual mention network, which has been shown to
224
model information diffusion well (Adamic und Adar, 2003; Huberman u.a., 2008; Romero
225
u.a., 2013). In particular, the nodes in this network are all agents and there is an edge
226
between agents i and j if both users mentioned the other at least once in the Twitter
227
Decahose sample. The strength of the edge from i to j is proportional to the number
228
of times user i mentioned user j in the sample. Although all ties are reciprocated, the
229
network is directed because the strength of the edge from i to j may not match the
230
strength of the edge from j to i. This network contains 2,937,405 users and 29,153,138
231
edges.
232
3.3 Hashtags
233
This study models the spread of 1,337 popular hashtags between 2013 and 2022. This
234
section describes how hashtags and their initial adopters and identities are selected.
235
3.3.1 Definition
236
As this paper seeks to study the roles of network and identity in the lifecycle of the
237
production of novel culture, we select hashtags where:
238
1. Hashtag is well-adopted: Sufficientlypopularhashtagscanbeconsideredcultural
239
objects, used to allow Twitter users to position their own thoughts in context of a
240
broader conversation La Rocca (2020); Page (2012). To ensure that the hashtag was
241
popular enough to be considered part of a “broader conversation,” we included only
242
hashtags with 1,000 or more uses in our Decahose sample.
243
2. Hashtag is new: Our goal is to model the spread of hashtags from when they’re
244
coined to their dissemination. Therefore, we include hashtags that have had low
245
7adoption before the data collection window (i.e., they are novel) and whose initial
246
adopters we can identify in our data.
247
3. Hashtag represents truly innovative culture: We are interested in modeling
248
the diffusion of cultural innovation on Twitter. Therefore, hashtags of interest do
249
not reference common words or phrases, and are not simply the names of existing
250
named entities (e.g., celebrities, movie titles). Instead, they are neologisms or novel
251
phrases that are partly or wholly created by the community.
252
3.3.2 Identification
253
WeapplytheabovedefinitiontosystematicallyselecthashtagsfromtheTwitterDecahose
254
sample between January 2012 and December 2022. First, we collect all tweets from the
255
Decahose sample that were posted by the 2,937,405 users in our network. These tweets
256
contain 198,988 hashtags that were used at least 100 times. Next, we filter these hashtags,
257
as follows:
258
1. Popularity: To limit our study to hashtags that eventually became popular, we
259
eliminate 116,477 hashtags that were used fewer than 1,000 times between 2013 and
260
2022. Frequencies are counted without considering case(e.g., #GoSox is considered
261
the same hashtag as #gosox). While some studies may also consider less popular
262
hashtags, weeliminatethesebecausemanyofthepropertieswe’reinterestedincan’t
263
be calculated or are too noisy on small cascades.
264
2. Novelty: Tolimitourstudytonewlycoinedhashtags, weeliminate77,134hashtags
265
that were used more than 100 times in 2012 (e.g., #obama2012, #sup, #sobad,
266
#sandlot).
267
3. Innovativeness: To ensure the hashtag represents production of novel culture
268
(e.g., it is not a reference to some named entity, a common phrase, or a diction-
269
ary word), we eliminate 3,144 hashtags that were entries in the Merriam Webster
270
English-language dictionary (e.g., #explore, #dirt) or in Wikidata, a repository of
271
popular named entities and phrases (e.g., #domesticviolence, #billcosby, #interi-
272
ordesign). Since hashtags cannot contain certain characters that might appear in
273
the dictionary and Wikidata (e.g., spaces, apostrophes, periods), we replaced these
274
characters with both spaces and underscores to ensure that we eliminate hashtags
275
using these different conventions. Two authors reviewed a sample of 100 of these
276
hashtags and determined that 84% of them were examples of novel cultural produc-
277
tion, rather than references to entities, dictionary words, or other non-cultural or
278
existing cultural references (annotation guidelines in Appendix A).
279
4. Presence of Seed Nodes: To ensure that the hashtag was coined between 2013
280
and2022,weeliminate896hashtagswhosecascadebeganbefore2013(e.g.,#theedm-
281
8soundofla, #southernstreets, #rastafarijams). The procedure to identify seed nodes
282
is described in Section 3.3.3.
283
After this filtering, we were left with 1,337 hashtags.
284
3.3.3 Initial Adopters
285
Each cascade’s initial adopters are the users whose adoption of the hashtag 1) was likely
286
not influenced by prior usage on Twitter and 2) likely influenced future adoption of the
287
hashtag. To identify these users, we first find instances where each hashtag had a period
288
of contiguous usage, by looking for periods of time when the hashtag was used at least
289
100 times in the Decahose sample (likely at least 1,000 times overall) with less than a
290
month’s gap between successive uses. Prior work has determined that after one month of
291
inactivity, the subsequent usage of a hashtag is likely not in response to any prior usage
292
(Ananthasubramaniam u.a., 2024). Additionally, a hashtag’s prior period usage is more
293
likely to be remembered if it was used more frequently in the prior period (Lehmann u.a.,
294
2012; Lorenz-Spreen u.a., 2019). As such, we assume that the cascade starts during the
295
first period where the hashtag was used more than 1,000 times, since: any usage prior to
296
this start date is likely unrelated to the cascade, since it was used too infrequently for
297
users in the cascade to have a high likelihood of adoption; and adopters after the start
298
date are likely to remember the usage in this first period because of its high frequency.
299
The hashtag’s initial adopters are the first ten users to use the hashtag after the start
300
date.
301
3.3.4 Hashtag Identity
302
Each hashtag signals an identity, determined by the composition of its initial adopters.
303
Initial adopters who are more strongly aligned with a particular identity are more likely
304
to coin hashtags that signal that identity (Agha, 2005). Accordingly, if the median initial
305
adopter is sufficiently extreme in any given register of identity (in the top 25th percentile
306
of that identity, using the threshold from (cf. Ananthasubramaniam u.a., 2024)), the
307
hashtag signals that identity.
308
4. Evaluating Simulated Cascades
309
When comparing empirical and simulated adoption, researchers often choose to focus on
310
reproducing certain desired properties of a cascade rather than predicting exactly which
311
individuals will adopt the focal behavior, because there is a high degree of stochasticity
312
in adoption decisions (Hofman u.a., 2017; Li u.a., 2021; Zhou u.a., 2021). However,
313
the properties used in the literature vary widely and are often uncorrelated in their per-
314
formance (common metrics include measures like cascade size, growth, properties of the
315
9adopter subgraph, and virality). In order to comprehensively study the effects of net-
316
work and identity on the diffusion of hashtags on Twitter, we develop a framework to
317
analyze a model’s ability to reproduce ten different properties of cascades, related to a
318
cascade’s popularity, growth, and adopter composition. This requires evaluating models
319
across all ten measures and then combining the ten evaluation scores into a composite
320
Cascade Match Index (cmi) to measure the overall performance across the ten measures.
321
To enable error analysis, we do not compare the distribution of properties over all trials;
322
instead we calculate the cmi score for each pair of simulated and empirical cascades and
323
then average errors over all simulations.
324
For each of the ten metrics, we explain 1) what property of the hashtag is being
325
measured and 2) how comparisons between pairs of simulated and empirical cascades are
326
made.
327
4.1 Popularity
328
Cascades are often modeled with the goal of understanding the dynamics underlying
329
popularity (Kupavskii u.a., 2012; Zhou u.a., 2021). More popular hashtags experience
330
high levels of adoption or adoption in parts of the social network that are very distant
331
from the initial adopters, increasing the influence they have on popular culture.
332
M1: Level of Usage One of the most common metrics used to measure the popularity
333
of a new behavior is simply how often the behavior is used. M1 calculates the number of
334
times a hashtag is used in each cascade, including repeated usage by a user. Comparing
335
simulated and empirical usage requires a measure that operates on a logarithmic rather
336
than a linear scale (e.g., not relative error), because the level of usage could span several
337
orders of magnitude. For instance, if the empirical cascade had 1,000 uses in the Decahose
338
sample (or an expected 10,000 uses on all of Twitter), simulation 1 had 5,000 uses, and
339
simulation 2 had 20,000 uses, a measure like relative error would show that simulation 1
340
has smaller error than simulation 2 (|10,000 − 5,000| vs. |10,000 − 20,000|); however,
341
since cascades often grow exponentially (Zhang u.a., 2016b), it would be better for both
342
to have the same magnitude of error since one is half as big and the other is twice as
343
big as the empirical cascade. Therefore, we compare the ratio of simulated to empirical
344
usage on a logarithmic scale |log( M1sim )|, henceforth referred to as the log-ratio error.
345
10·M1emp
We compare M1 to 10·M1 because the empirical cascades are drawn from a 10%
sim emp 346
sample of Twitter and, therefore, we expect M1 to be 10 times larger on all of Twitter.
emp 347
M2: Number of Adopters In addition to the level of usage, another popular way of
348
measuring popularity is the number of unique adopters in a cascade. M2 looks at the
349
number of unique users in the downsampled cascade who adopted each hashtag. Unlike
350
M1, M2doesnotconsiderrepeatedusageandmaybemuchlowerthanM1whenacascade
351
experiences a high volume of usage by a small group of users (e.g., for niche cascades that
352
10are really popular among a small group of users); however, in many cases, M1 and M2 are
353
likely to be correlated. Since, like M1, the number of adopters also scales exponentially,
354
comparisons between empirical and simulated cascades are made using the log-ratio error.
355
M3: Structural Virality Another way of measuring the popularity of a hashtag is to
356
assess how deeply the hashtag has permeated the network (Goel u.a., 2016b). Structural
357
virality measures exactly this. When initial adopters are not known, structural virality
358
is operationalized as the mean distance between all pairs of adopters (the Wiener index).
359
However, as initial adopters are known in our models, structural virality is defined as
360
the average distance between each adopter and the nearest seed node. Unlike M1 and
361
M2, path lengths in a network vary in a smaller range (e.g., prior work has found that
362
paths are usually between 3 and 12 hops long (Leskovec und Horvitz, 2008)). Therefore,
363
comparisons between the structural virality of each simulated and empirical cascade are
364
made using relative error with respect to the empirical cascade |M3sim−M3emp|.
365

4.2 Growth
366
In order to understand how hashtags become viral, many studies look not just at the
367
popularity of a hashtag but also how its adoption shifts over time (Chang, 2010; Sarkar
368
u.a., 2017). There are a number of commonly studied properties of cascades that measure
369
how they grow.
370
M4: Shape of Adoption Curve The shape of a hashtag’s adoption curve (or the
371
numberofusesovertime)isindicativeofdifferentmechanismsthatmaypromoteorinhibit
372
a cascade’s growth (Pemberton, 1936; Sarkar u.a., 2017). M4 is modeled by splitting
373
both the simulated and empirical time series into T evenly-spaced intervals, where T is
374
the smaller of a) the number of timesteps in the simulation and b) the number of hours in
375
the empirical cascade. To make the empirical curve comparable to the simulated curve,
376
we first truncate the adoption curve’s right tail once adoption levels remain low for a
377
sustained period of time, to match the simulation’s stopping criteria. We compare the
378
empirical and simulated curves using the dynamic time warping (DTW) distance between
379
them.
380
M5: Usage per Adopter Hashtags where users tend to use the hashtag more of-
381
ten have different growth patterns than hashtags where each adopter uses the hashtag
382
fewer times (Ellis, 2002). M5 calculates the average number of times each adopter used
383
the hashtag. Comparisons between simulated and empirical cascades are made with the
384
relative error.
385
M6: Edge Density Thestructureofthe adoptersubgraphofthenetworkoftenreflects
386
how a cascade grows and spreads through the network (Aiello u.a., 2012). In particular,
387
11the connectivity or edge density within M6 is operationalized as the number of edges,
388
or edge density, within the adopter subgraph.1 Since edges in the adopter subgraph can
389
be very sparse or very dense and these scenarios change the number of edges by several
390
orders of magnitude, the empirical and simulated edge densities are compared using the
391
log-ratio error.
392
M7: Growth Predictivity In many cases, it is useful to be able to predict how big a
393
cascade will become based on a small set of initial adopters (Kupavskii u.a., 2012; Cheng
394
u.a., 2014; Li u.a., 2017). In order to test how well each model achieves this task, we
395
attempt to predict the size of each empirical cascade based on the characteristics of the
396
first 100 adopters in each simulation using a multi-layer perceptron regression with 100
397
hidden layers, an Adam optimizer, and ReLU activation. Predictors include a set of 711
398
attributes from Cheng u.a. (2014) that are not directly used by our models: the timestep
399
at which each of the first 100 adopters used the hashtag; the degree of each adopter in the
400
full network and adopter subgraph (note that the identity-only model preserves degrees
401
of each agent); and the age and gender of each adopter, inferred using Wang u.a. (2019)’s
402
demographic inference algorithm, etc. Simulated and empirical cascades are compared
403
using the relative error of the predicted cascade size.
404
4.3 Adopters
405
In addition to modeling popularity and growth, there has been significant research on
406
how certain subpopulations come to adopt new culture (Anderson u.a., 2015; Cheng u.a.,
407
2016). We identify a set of three measures of how well a simulated cascade reproduces
408
the composition of adopters.
409
M8: Demographic Similarity New culture is often adopted in demographically (e.g.,
410
racially, socioeconomically, linguistically) homogenous groups. This may occur when the
411
cultural artifact is explicitly signaling an affiliation with the demographic identity (e.g.,
412
#strugglesofbeingblack) or when the artifact does not explicitly acknowledge an identity
413
but ends up being used more in one group than another by convention (e.g., Democrats
414
use more swear words online (Sylwester und Purver, 2015)) (Eckert, 2008; Sylwester und
415
Purver, 2015; Abitbol u.a., 2018; Stewart u.a., 2018). We compare the distribution of
416
demographic attributes from Section 3.2.1 in adopters from empirical and simulated cas-
417
cades. Since there are many demographic attributes, we construct a one-dimensional
418
measure of these attributes using a propensity score. This propensity score is the pre-
419
dicted probability obtained by regressing the demographic attributes on a binary variable
420
indicating whether the user is from the simulated or empirical cascade. This propensity
421

Wechosenottousethenumberofconnectedcomponentsbecausethecorrespondingerrorwasreasonably
correlated with edge density, so they didn’t seem like sufficiently different measures; additionally, unlike
edge density, the connected components often change dramatically after downsampling.
12score has two important properties: 1) users that are adopters in both cascades will not
422
factor into the construction of the propensity score since they are represented as both
423
1’s and 0’s in the logistic regression; and 2) if the empirical and simulated adopters have
424
similar demographic distributions, the propensity scores of adopters in the empirical cas-
425
cade will have a similar distribution as the propensity scores of adopters in the simulated
426
cascade (Rosenbaum und Rubin, 1983). The differences in demographics between simu-
427
lated and empirical cascades is measured using the Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence of
428
the distribution of the empirical adopters’ and simulated adopters’ propensity scores.
429
M9: Geographic Similarity Another property of interest is whether a model can
430
reproducewhereadoptersofahashtagarelocatedinU.S.A.(Eisensteinu.a.,2012;Huang
431
u.a., 2016). The location of adopters is modeled as a smoothed county-level distribution
432
of the fraction of users in the county who adopted the hashtag. Geographic similarity is
433
measured as the Lee’s L spatial correlation (Lee, 2001) between the spatial distributions
434
of empirical and simulated usage (cf. Ananthasubramaniam u.a., 2024).
435
M10: Network Property Similarity Another property of cascades is the position
436
of adopters within the network (e.g., the communities they belong to, their centrality)
437
(Watts, 2002; Jalili und Perc, 2017). We calculate each user’s position in the network
438
along four relatively low-correlated (Pearson’s R < 0.5) network properties, including
439
PageRank, eigencentrality, transitivity, and community membership (using the Louvain
440
community detection algorithm (Blondel u.a., 2008)). Similar to M8, we represent the
441
adopters’ network positions using a propensity score, and compare the distribution of
442
empirical adopters’ and simulated adopters’ propensity scores using KL divergence.
443
4.4 Composite Metric
444
In order to evaluate how well each model reproduces properties M1 through M10, we
445
construct a composite Cascade Match Index (cmi) encompassing all ten metrics. The
446
cmi is defined as the normalized similarity between simulated and empirical cascades,
447
averaged over all ten metrics. See Section B for details. The ten measures comprising the
448
cmi are overall poorly correlated with each other (Figure S1), suggesting that M1-M10
449
do, in fact, measure distinct properties of the cascade and are not redundant.
450
5. Network and Identity Model Different Attributes of
451
a Cascade
452
Now we use the methods from the prior sections to test our main hypothesis: That
453
network and identity together better predict properties of cascades compared to network
454
or identity alone.

460
this parameter, and 4) compare properties of the simulated and empirical cascades. Then

5.2 Results
463
Figure 1a shows that the Network+Identity model outperforms the Network-only and
464
Identity-onlycounterfactualsonthecompositecmi—suggestingthat,onthewhole,hashtag
465
cascades are best modeled using a combination of network and identity.
466
However, our results also suggest that, while models involving both network and iden-
467
tityaremostperformantoverall,thereisimportantheterogeneityinwhatsocialfactorsare
468
required to reproduce different properties of hashtag cascades. Thus, while incorporating
469

470
network-only or identity-only model may be a better choice for some features of interest.
471
As shown in Table S1, the Network+Identity model had the top performance on a

xednI

edacsaClarger number of individual metrics (5 of 10) than the Network-only (2) or Identity-
473
only (3) models. Notably, however, the Network+Identity model did not have the top
474
performance on all metrics. Overall, the Network-only model tended to perform best on
475
popularity-related metrics; it had the highest score on M2 and M3, as well as a higher
476
score on a composite index of the three growth-related measures (Figure 1). On the other
477
hand, the Identity-only model tends to perform better on adopter-related metrics, while
478
growth-related metrics were best modeled by a combination of both factors. Moreover, on
479
the whole, the Network+Identity model had the highest score on the cmi in 42% (2,791)
480
of trials, while the Network-only model had the highest score in 30% (1,992) and the
481
Identity-only model in 28% (1,902) of trials.
482
A possible explanation for the heterogeneity in performance is that different mechan-
483
isms are responsible for different properties of cascades. For instance, when we select the
484
model that has the highest score on the cmi for each trial (we’ll call this the optimal cus-
485
tomized model), the average score on the cmi improves from 0.06 in the Network+Identity
486
model to 0.27 with the optimal customized model (this is a jump in 0.21 points, in con-
487
trast to a jump in 0.11 points between the Network+Identity and Identity-only model)
488
(Figure 1b, pink vs. dark blue bars); moreover, the performance on popularity, growth,
489
and adopter characteristics each improves in this optimal customized model as well. This
490
suggests that the mechanisms underlying the diffusion of hashtags are likely heterogen-
491
eous: most hashtags are best modeled by a combination of network and identity, but
492
some are better modeled by network alone or identity alone. Identifying which of these
493
three mechanisms best applies to the hashtag can lead to significant predictive gains.
494
Since our goal is to produce a unified model that simultaneously reproduces all properties
495
of cascades, one option is to identify conditions under which network and identity are
496
needed—that is, to create a predicted customized model that uses features of the hashtag
497
and early adopters to decide whether to use network or identity or both, instead of an
498
optimal customized model where the model selection is performed post-hoc. We explore
499
this idea in the next section.
500
6. Roles of Network and Identity in Different Contexts
501
The diffusion of hashtags specifically, as well as the process of cultural production more
502
generally, varies across contexts. For instance, hashtags with demographically homogen-
503
ous initial adopters are more likely to be used to signal identity (Agha, 2005; Smith und
504
Smith, 2012). Additionally, hashtags have different patterns of diffusion depending on
505
their topic or semantic context (Romero u.a., 2011; Lehmann u.a., 2012). The goals of
506
this section are to understand whether information about the hashtag and its initial adop-
507
ters 1) are associated with model performance and 2) can be used to develop a predicted
508
customized model.

Figure 2: Although the Network+Identity model never underperforms the others, the per-
formance of all three models and the relative advantage of the Network+Identity model
varies by the topic of the hashtag. Effects are estimated by running a regression, con-
trolling for other variables related to the hashtag’s context.
6.1 Experimental Setup
510
In order to understand the relationship between the context in which each hashtag was
511
coined and the role of network and identity, we run a linear regression to test the associ-
512
ation between the cmi and several properties of the hashtag. As shown in Equation 2, we
513
estimate the effect of each covariate c on the cmi of each model (e.g., β estimates the
i 1 514
effect of the first covariate on cmi in the Network+Identity model; β +βN estimates the
1 1 515
effect in the Network-only model). Our regression estimates the effect of each property
516
after controlling for all other properties (e.g., the effect of racial similarity in initial ad-
517
opters is independent of the effect of their geographic proximity, even though these two
518
factors are correlated).

Covariates are four sets of properties of the hashtag’s context (the distribution of each
520
property is in Figure S1):
521
Topic. The topic of a hashtag (e.g., whether it is related to sports, pop culture, or some
522
other subject matter) may be associated with the extent to which network and identity
523
play a role in its diffusion. For instance, prior work has shown that hashtags related
524
to different topics may diffuse at different scales and via different mechanisms Romero
525
u.a. (2011). Therefore, we include each hashtag’s topic, measured using the model from
526
Antypas u.a. (2022), as a covariate in Equation 2. Appendix C has more details.
527
Communicative Need. Propertiesofhashtagcascadesmayalsobeattributabletodif-
528
ferences in the hashtags’ semantic roles Lehmann u.a. (2012). For instance, hashtags that
529
16are in higher demand (e.g., because they belong to a fast-growing subset of the semantic
530
space) or lower supply (e.g., because there are fewer alternatives to choose among) may
531
have higher levels of communicative need and, therefore, different social factors may be
532
responsible for their spread (Stewart und Eisenstein, 2018; Karjus u.a., 2020). Ryskina
533
u.a. (2020) quantified communicative need using two measures: 1) semantic sparsity, or
534
how many similar hashtags exist in the lexicon when the focal hashtag was introduced
535
(a hashtag in a sparse space may be in higher demand since there are fewer hashtags
536
that can serve the same function); and 2) semantic growth, or the growth in the semantic
537
space over time (a hashtag in a high-growth space may be in higher demand since it
538
serves a purpose of increasing popularity). For instance, a hashtag like #broncosnation
539
(signifying support for the city of Denver’s local football team) has low semantic sparsity,
540
because many cities had similar sports hashtags when it was coined; it also has low se-
541
mantic growth because, while sports team hashtags are popular, the use of these sorts
542
of hashtags has remained fairly stable over time. Appendix C has details on how these
543
measures are operationalized.
544
Identity. As described in Section 3.3.4, each hashtag’s identity is based on the demo-
545
graphics of the first ten adopters. Since the identities of early adopters may influence
546
the perception of the hashtag (Agha, 2005), and since having more homogenous initial
547
adopters may lead to stronger perceptions, covariates include the mean similarity of ini-
548
tial adopters within each component of identity (location, race, socioeconomic status,
549
languages spoken, political affiliation).
550
Initial Network Position. Another factor in a hashtag’s diffusion is where in the
551
network the hashtag is introduced (Watts, 2002; Jalili und Perc, 2017). For instance,
552
more central initial adopters or those belonging to larger communities in the network
553
may be able to spread the hashtag more broadly because of their influence. Therefore,
554
covariates include the median initial adopter’s PageRank, eigencentrality, and how many
555
initial adopters fall into each of the network’s communities.
556
6.2 Results
557
Figures 2- 5 show the results of the regression model (Equation 2); the y-axes plot the
558
predicted cmi for each model, corresponding to different levels of each covariate, con-
559
ditional on all other covariates. In general, the Network+Identity model performs as
560
well as or better than the other models under all conditions. This suggests that the
561
conclusions from Section 5—that network and identity better predict cascades together
562
than separately—are robust. In addition, there are three key takeaways about model
563
performance.
564
First, the Network+Identity model tends to outperform the other models in cases
565
where there is a theoretical expectation that network and identity would each contribute

a portion of the underlying diffusion mechanism. For instance, when initial adopters have
567
ahighlevelofracialsimilarity, theNetwork+Identitymodel’sperformanceimproveswhile
568
othermodelsgetworse; thisisconsistentwiththetheoreticalframeworkofSharma(2013),
569
where hashtags used to signal racial identity on Black Twitter diffuse via a mechanism
570
that combines network and identity. Similarly, regional hashtags may require network and
571
identity to constrain adopters to the local area (Schwartz und Halegoua, 2015); consistent
572
with this expectation, the Network+Identity model has its highest performance among
573
hashtags that promote regional culture, including sports hashtags (which often express
574
support for local teams), news hashtags (which are often related to regional events),
575
and hashtags whose initial adopters are located near each other. The Network+Identity
576
model also has the best performance on geographic distribution of adoption, suggesting a
577
connection between this model and the ability to predict geographic localization (Labov,
578
2007; Ananthasubramaniam u.a., 2024). Similarly, hashtags related to certain topics—
579
sports, film/TV/video, diaries/daily life, and news/social concern—tend to be better
580
modeled by the Network+Identity simulations, and prior work has shown that network
581
and identity contribute to their growth. Accordingly, identity also mediates the spread of
582
sports hashtags on the Twitter network, so only fans of a specific team adopt the hashtag
583
but the hashtag can still be seen by supporters of rival teams (Smith und Smith, 2012).
584
Theothertypesofhashtagsareoftenusedinconversationsthatinvolvestance-takingand,
585
in the process, identity signaling (e.g., sharing their opinion on issues of social concern,
586
their favorite TV show, and aspects of daily life) (Evans, 2016).
587
Second, the Network+Identity model may outperform the Network-only and Identity-
588
only models because hashtags that diffuse via two mechanisms are more likely to become
589
popular than hashtags diffusing via just one (Han u.a., 2020; Hoang und Lim, 2012).
590
For instance, the Network+Identity model outperforms baselines among hashtags in very
591
slow- or very fast-growing areas, but not among hashtags with moderate growth (Fig-

ure 4). Similarly, the model has its highest comparative advantage when initial adopters
593
are moderately central. In cases of extreme growth or moderate initial adopter centrality,
594
hashtags that diffuse via multiple mechanisms (network and identity) may be overrepres-
595
ented in our sample of popular hashtags. These hashtags are also likely to pertain to a
596
smaller
597
Third, the Network+Identity model often has its strongest comparative advantage
598
when the Network-only and Identity-only models perform well. For instance, all three
599
models perform well when the hashtag is related to topics like sports, film, pop culture,
600
and daily life; or in moderate ranges of covariates like linguistic, socioeconomic, and
601
political identity, centrality, and semantic growth. This suggests that, even when single-
602
variable models have relatively high predictive power, combining multiple social factors
603
can improve performance.
604
6.3 Selecting Among Models
605
Since there are associations between the characteristics of the hashtags and the relative
606
performance of the three models, we develop a predicted customized model that uses
607
these characteristics to determine whether network alone, identity alone, or both together
608
would perform best on the cmi. Using the features described in Section 6.1, we trained
609
a random forest classifier to predict whether each hashtag would be best predicted by
610
the Network+Identity, Network-only, or Identity-only model. Predictions were obtained
611
using a repeated 5-fold cross-validation (the model was trained on sets 2-5 and predictions
612
generated for set 1; then trained on sets 1 and 3-5 and predictions generated for set 2;

614
The random forest classifier weakly outperforms a baseline that always selects the
615
Network+Identity model (0.44 vs. 0.41 accuracy); however, in spite of this, the pre-
616
dicted customized model significantly outperforms the Network+Identity model on the
617
cmi (Figure 1b, light blue bars), suggesting that the classifier may be picking out ex-
618
amples of hashtags that are “obviously” or “easily” identifiable as being better-modeled
619
by network or identity alone and where the single-variable models are associated with
620
significant predictive improvements over the Network+Identity model. This predicted
621
customized model achieves its gain in performance by better reproducing properties re-
622
lated to popularity (where it equals the Network-only model’s performance) and adopter
623
characteristics, and trading off slightly lower performance on the growth-related measures
624
(Figure 1b, comparing light and dark blue bars). These results suggest that the initial
625
characteristics of cascades can, in some cases, signal the driving mechanism behind the
626
hashtag’s diffusion and therefore the best model to estimate the cascade.
627
7. Discussion
628
Our work suggests that modeling cultural production and the adoption of cultural innov-
629
ation requires explicitly incorporating the role of multiple social factors in the process
630
of diffusion. This study examines the role of Network and Identity in the diffusion of
631
novel hashtags on Twitter. In order to test the roles of network and identity in diffusion,
632
we evaluate whether a model containing network and identity better reproduces proper-
633
ties of each hashtag’s cascade than models containing just network or just identity—and
634
whether this holds across different types of hashtags. The results support our hypothesis
635
from three standpoints. First, the model with both identities and network better repro-
636
duces an aggregate of cascade properties than models with identity or network alone.
637
Second, many individual properties are also better modeled with network and identity
638
together. Third, these findings are true across many different types of hashtags (different
639
topics, identities, etc.). These findings are significant because most existing work has
640
focused on the effects of single factors (e.g., network or identity) rather than creating
641
a model that combines multiple social factors to explain the diffusion of behaviors and
642
culture. Our work suggests that there is value in adding extra complexity by multiple
643
interacting factors.
644
However, our analysis also reveals that there is important heterogeneity in the roles
645
network and identity play in cultural production. For instance, network structure does
646
a worse job modeling the adopter composition of cascades, while identity underperforms
647
at modeling a cascade’s popularity. Additionally, there are several contexts where the
648
network and identity likely offer non-duplicative conditions for diffusion or jointly con-
649
fer some selective advantage to new hashtags. Under these conditions, it is especially
650
important for models of cascades to combine both factors.
651
20Finally, our analysis has two limitations that can be addressed by future work: First,
652
our model only considered network and identity, but did not integrate other social factors
653
known to influence the spread of innovation (e.g., the type of relationships between users
654
or the perception or planned use of a hashtag). This limitation could be responsible for
655
some heterogeneity in performance (perhaps factors other than network and identity are
656
requiredtomodelhashtagcascadesandareparticularlyimportantforreproducingcertain
657
properties or in the extremes of some hashtag characteristics’ parameter space). However,
658
such factors are difficult to model at scale and, thus, were outside the scope of the paper.
659
Our Network+Identity model always used both network and identity rather than se-
660
lectingwhichfeatureswouldworkbestforeachhashtag. Ourworkwasafirststeptowards
661
developing such a customized model. However, future work could likely improve upon this
662
initial model. In order to facilitate future work, we release a database of the 1,337 hasht-
663
ags included in this study, which were coined between 2013 and 2022, used frequently,
664
and likely to represent novel cultural production; using a 10% sample of Twitter, we de-
665
velop a database of each hashtag’s adoption and a rich set of features like the hashtag’s
666
topic, embedding, communicative need, and the identities of adopters. We also release a
667
composite cmi that evaluates the performance of a model on its ability to reproduce ten
668
frequently-studied properties of cascades, including those related to popularity, growth,
669
and adopter composition. Based on a comprehensive literature review, we identify ten
670
frequently-modeled properties of cascades related to their popularity (e.g., cascade size),
671
growth(e.g., shapeofthegrowthcurve), andadoptercomposition(e.g., demographicsim-
672
ilarity) and construct a composite cmi that compares empirical and simulated cascades
673
across all ten properties.

ating new, innovative culture. While “culture” is a broad term, our definition excludes
927
hashtags that make reference to entities by their official name (e.g., a person by their full
928
name or stage name, a location, a song title), common phrases, and single words, since
929
those hashtags do not seem innovative. However, the following types of hashtags can and
930
should be considered examples of cultural production, because their existence requires in-
931
novative choices and combinations of words: nicknames or fan-created names for entities,
932
slogans, combinations of dictionary words, slogans, and acronyms. Examples of hashtags

This means that higher
939
values of the cmi correspond to better fit between empirical and simulated cascades.
940
Additionally, since each measure is on a different scale, we standardize all similarities
941
using a z-score; to facilitate cross-model comparisons, z-scores are calculated across all
942
three models (Network+Identity, Network-only, Identity-only) rather than within each
943
model. Finally, since model parameters are calibrated to the cascade size, and since
944
empirical cascades (which came from the Twitter Decahose) are expected to be 10% the
945
size of simulated cascades, we downsample the larger cascade to match the size of the
946
smaller one for properties M2 - M10 (e.g., if the simulated cascade ends up being 10 times
947
bigger than the empirical cascade, we randomly sample 10% of the simulated cascade
948
and compare that downsampled cascade to the empirical cascade). This downsampling
949
ensures that the comparison between the empirical and simulated cascade is independent
950
of size—e.g., that certain models do not better match properties because they were easier
951
to calibrate to the correct cascade size.
952
C. Hashtag Characteristics
953
C.1 Topic
954
We define a hashtag’s topic as the most frequent topic of the tweets it appears in, where
955
tweettopicsareinferredusingAntypasu.a.(2022)’ssupervisedmulti-labeltopicclassifier.
956
Fromtheoriginalsetof23topics, wecombinecategoriescontainingfewerthan50hashtags
957
into other categories that they most frequently co-occur with (e.g., Learning & Educa-
958
tional with Youth & Student Life), and end up with seven categories: diaries and daily
959
life (379 hashtags, e.g., #relationshipwontworkif, #learnlife, #birthdaybehavior), sports
960
(269 hashtags, e.g., #seahawksnation, #throwupthex, #dunkcity), celebrity and pop cul-
961
ture(213hashtags,e.g.,#freesosa,#beyoncebowl,#kikifollowspree),film/TV/video(154
962
hashtags, e.g., #iveseeneveryepisodeof, #betterbatmanthanbenaffleck, #doctorwho50th),
963
news and social concern (130 hashtags, e.g., #impeachmentday, #getcovered, #sayso-

965
ingband,#flawlessremix),andotherhobbies(89hashtags,e.g.,#camsbookclub,#amazon-
966
cart, #polyvorestyle).
967
C.2 Semantic Sparsity and Growth
968
Semantic sparsity and growth are measured as follows: Each hashtag’s 250-dimensional
969
embedding is constructed by training the word2vec algorithm over a window of 5 tokens
970
and 800 epochs; in order to ensure that the hashtags in our study have high enough
971
token frequency to be included in the final model, word2vec was trained on all tweets
972
containing the 1,337 hashtags in our sample and a random sample of 20 million other
973
tweets containing hashtags in our Twitter Decahose sample. Using the resulting word
974
30embeddings,semanticsparsityisthenumberofhashtagsthatwereusedinsimilarcontexts
975
at the time when the hashtag was coined (similarity means the cosine similarity of the
976
embeddings is at least 0.3,2 representing the supply of similar hashtags) and the semantic
977
growth is the Spearman rank correlation between the frequency of all tokens that are
978
similar to the hashtag and the month (where a correlation of 1 means that words that are
979
similar to the hashtag are becoming more popular over time, and 0 means the hashtag is
980
used in contexts of static popularity).
981
2The threshold of 0.3 is slightly lower than the threshold of 0.35 used in the original paper, so that
more hashtags have neighbors.
