        "summary": "Mitotic activity is an important feature for grading several cancer types.\nCounting mitotic figures (MFs) is a time-consuming, laborious task prone to\ninter-observer variation. Inaccurate recognition of MFs can lead to incorrect\ngrading and hence potential suboptimal treatment. In this study, we propose an\nartificial intelligence (AI)-aided approach to detect MFs in digitised\nhaematoxylin and eosin-stained whole slide images (WSIs). Advances in this area\nare hampered by the limited number and types of cancer datasets of MFs. Here we\nestablish the largest pan-cancer dataset of mitotic figures by combining an\nin-house dataset of soft tissue tumours (STMF) with five open-source mitotic\ndatasets comprising multiple human cancers and canine specimens (ICPR, TUPAC,\nCCMCT, CMC and MIDOG++). This new dataset identifies 74,620 MFs and 105,538\nmitotic-like figures. We then employed a two-stage framework (the Optimised\nMitoses Generator Network (OMG-Net) to classify MFs. The framework first\ndeploys the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to automate the contouring of MFs and\nsurrounding objects. An adapted ResNet18 is subsequently trained to classify\nMFs. OMG-Net reaches an F1-score of 0.84 on pan-cancer MF detection (breast\ncarcinoma, neuroendocrine tumour and melanoma), largely outperforming the\nprevious state-of-the-art MIDOG++ benchmark model on its hold-out testing set\n(e.g. +16% F1-score on breast cancer detection, p<0.001) thereby providing\nsuperior accuracy in detecting MFs on various types of tumours obtained with\ndifferent scanners.",

        "summary": "Vision Transformers (ViT) have emerged as the de-facto choice for numerous\nindustry grade vision solutions. But their inference cost can be prohibitive\nfor many settings, as they compute self-attention in each layer which suffers\nfrom quadratic computational complexity in the number of tokens. On the other\nhand, spatial information in images and spatio-temporal information in videos\nis usually sparse and redundant. In this work, we introduce LookupViT, that\naims to exploit this information sparsity to reduce ViT inference cost.\nLookupViT provides a novel general purpose vision transformer block that\noperates by compressing information from higher resolution tokens to a fixed\nnumber of tokens. These few compressed tokens undergo meticulous processing,\nwhile the higher-resolution tokens are passed through computationally cheaper\nlayers. Information sharing between these two token sets is enabled through a\nbidirectional cross-attention mechanism. The approach offers multiple\nadvantages - (a) easy to implement on standard ML accelerators (GPUs/TPUs) via\nstandard high-level operators, (b) applicable to standard ViT and its variants,\nthus generalizes to various tasks, (c) can handle different tokenization and\nattention approaches. LookupViT also offers flexibility for the compressed\ntokens, enabling performance-computation trade-offs in a single trained model.\nWe show LookupViT's effectiveness on multiple domains - (a) for\nimage-classification (ImageNet-1K and ImageNet-21K), (b) video classification\n(Kinetics400 and Something-Something V2), (c) image captioning (COCO-Captions)\nwith a frozen encoder. LookupViT provides $2\\times$ reduction in FLOPs while\nupholding or improving accuracy across these domains. In addition, LookupViT\nalso demonstrates out-of-the-box robustness and generalization on image\nclassification (ImageNet-C,R,A,O), improving by up to $4\\%$ over ViT.",

        "summary": "Vision Transformers (ViTs) represent a groundbreaking shift in machine\nlearning approaches to computer vision. Unlike traditional approaches, ViTs\nemploy the self-attention mechanism, which has been widely used in natural\nlanguage processing, to analyze image patches. Despite their advantages in\nmodeling visual tasks, deploying ViTs on hardware platforms, notably\nField-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), introduces considerable challenges.\nThese challenges stem primarily from the non-linear calculations and high\ncomputational and memory demands of ViTs. This paper introduces CHOSEN, a\nsoftware-hardware co-design framework to address these challenges and offer an\nautomated framework for ViT deployment on the FPGAs in order to maximize\nperformance. Our framework is built upon three fundamental contributions:\nmulti-kernel design to maximize the bandwidth, mainly targeting benefits of\nmulti DDR memory banks, approximate non-linear functions that exhibit minimal\naccuracy degradation, and efficient use of available logic blocks on the FPGA,\nand efficient compiler to maximize the performance and memory-efficiency of the\ncomputing kernels by presenting a novel algorithm for design space exploration\nto find optimal hardware configuration that achieves optimal throughput and\nlatency. Compared to the state-of-the-art ViT accelerators, CHOSEN achieves a\n1.5x and 1.42x improvement in the throughput on the DeiT-S and DeiT-B models.",

        "summary": "Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs) have significantly advanced a variety of\nvision-language tasks. The scalability and availability of high-quality\ntraining data play a pivotal role in the success of LMMs. In the realm of food,\nwhile comprehensive food datasets such as Recipe1M offer an abundance of\ningredient and recipe information, they often fall short of providing ample\ndata for nutritional analysis. The Recipe1M+ dataset, despite offering a subset\nfor nutritional evaluation, is limited in the scale and accuracy of nutrition\ninformation. To bridge this gap, we introduce Uni-Food, a unified food dataset\nthat comprises over 100,000 images with various food labels, including\ncategories, ingredients, recipes, and ingredient-level nutritional information.\nUni-Food is designed to provide a more holistic approach to food data analysis,\nthereby enhancing the performance and capabilities of LMMs in this domain. To\nmitigate the conflicts arising from multi-task supervision during fine-tuning\nof LMMs, we introduce a novel Linear Rectification Mixture of Diverse Experts\n(RoDE) approach. RoDE utilizes a diverse array of experts to address tasks of\nvarying complexity, thereby facilitating the coordination of trainable\nparameters, i.e., it allocates more parameters for more complex tasks and,\nconversely, fewer parameters for simpler tasks. RoDE implements linear\nrectification union to refine the router's functionality, thereby enhancing the\nefficiency of sparse task allocation. These design choices endow RoDE with\nfeatures that ensure GPU memory efficiency and ease of optimization. Our\nexperimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in\naddressing the inherent challenges of food-related multitasking.",

        "summary": "Deep learning-based semiconductor defect inspection has gained traction in\nrecent years, offering a powerful and versatile approach that provides high\naccuracy, adaptability, and efficiency in detecting and classifying nano-scale\ndefects. However, semiconductor manufacturing processes are continually\nevolving, leading to the emergence of new types of defects over time. This\npresents a significant challenge for conventional supervised defect detectors,\nas they may suffer from catastrophic forgetting when trained on new defect\ndatasets, potentially compromising performance on previously learned tasks. An\nalternative approach involves the constant storage of previously trained\ndatasets alongside pre-trained model versions, which can be utilized for\n(re-)training from scratch or fine-tuning whenever encountering a new defect\ndataset. However, adhering to such a storage template is impractical in terms\nof size, particularly when considering High-Volume Manufacturing (HVM).\nAdditionally, semiconductor defect datasets, especially those encompassing\nstochastic defects, are often limited and expensive to obtain, thus lacking\nsufficient representation of the entire universal set of defectivity. This work\nintroduces a task-agnostic, meta-learning approach aimed at addressing this\nchallenge, which enables the incremental addition of new defect classes and\nscales to create a more robust and generalized model for semiconductor defect\ninspection. We have benchmarked our approach using real resist-wafer SEM\n(Scanning Electron Microscopy) datasets for two process steps, ADI and AEI,\ndemonstrating its superior performance compared to conventional supervised\ntraining methods.",
