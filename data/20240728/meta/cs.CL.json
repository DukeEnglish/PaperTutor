        "summary": "Effective training of language models (LMs) for mathematical reasoning tasks\ndemands high-quality supervised fine-tuning data. Besides obtaining annotations\nfrom human experts, a common alternative is sampling from larger and more\npowerful LMs. However, this knowledge distillation approach can be costly and\nunstable, particularly when relying on closed-source, proprietary LMs like\nGPT-4, whose behaviors are often unpredictable. In this work, we demonstrate\nthat the reasoning abilities of small-scale LMs can be enhanced through\nself-training, a process where models learn from their own outputs. We also\nshow that the conventional self-training can be further augmented by a\npreference learning algorithm called Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). By\nintegrating DPO into self-training, we leverage preference data to guide LMs\ntowards more accurate and diverse chain-of-thought reasoning. We evaluate our\nmethod across various mathematical reasoning tasks using different base models.\nOur experiments show that this approach not only improves LMs' reasoning\nperformance but also offers a more cost-effective and scalable solution\ncompared to relying on large proprietary LMs.",

        "summary": "Low-Rank Adaptation, also known as LoRA, has emerged as a prominent method\nfor parameter-efficient fine-tuning foundation models by re-parameterizing the\noriginal matrix into the product of two low-rank matrices. Despite its\nefficiency, LoRA often yields inferior performance compared to full\nfine-tuning. In this paper, we propose LoRA-Pro to bridge this performance gap.\nFirstly, we delve into the optimization processes in LoRA and full fine-tuning.\nWe reveal that while LoRA employs low-rank approximation, it neglects to\napproximate the optimization process of full fine-tuning. To address this, we\nintroduce a novel concept called the \"equivalent gradient.\" This virtual\ngradient makes the optimization process on the re-parameterized matrix\nequivalent to LoRA, which can be used to quantify the differences between LoRA\nand full fine-tuning. The equivalent gradient is derived from the gradients of\nmatrices $A$ and $B$. To narrow the performance gap, our approach minimizes the\ndifferences between the equivalent gradient and the gradient obtained from full\nfine-tuning during the optimization process. By solving this objective, we\nderive optimal closed-form solutions for updating matrices $A$ and $B$. Our\nmethod constrains the optimization process, shrinking the performance gap\nbetween LoRA and full fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on natural language\nprocessing tasks validate the effectiveness of our method.",

        "summary": "A central piece in enabling intelligent agentic behavior in foundation models\nis to make them capable of introspecting upon their behavior, reasoning, and\ncorrecting their mistakes as more computation or interaction is available. Even\nthe strongest proprietary large language models (LLMs) do not quite exhibit the\nability of continually improving their responses sequentially, even in\nscenarios where they are explicitly told that they are making a mistake. In\nthis paper, we develop RISE: Recursive IntroSpEction, an approach for\nfine-tuning LLMs to introduce this capability, despite prior work hypothesizing\nthat this capability may not be possible to attain. Our approach prescribes an\niterative fine-tuning procedure, which attempts to teach the model how to alter\nits response after having executed previously unsuccessful attempts to solve a\nhard test-time problem, with optionally additional environment feedback. RISE\nposes fine-tuning for a single-turn prompt as solving a multi-turn Markov\ndecision process (MDP), where the initial state is the prompt. Inspired by\nprinciples in online imitation learning and reinforcement learning, we propose\nstrategies for multi-turn data collection and training so as to imbue an LLM\nwith the capability to recursively detect and correct its previous mistakes in\nsubsequent iterations. Our experiments show that RISE enables Llama2, Llama3,\nand Mistral models to improve themselves with more turns on math reasoning\ntasks, outperforming several single-turn strategies given an equal amount of\ninference-time computation. We also find that RISE scales well, often attaining\nlarger benefits with more capable models. Our analysis shows that RISE makes\nmeaningful improvements to responses to arrive at the correct solution for\nchallenging prompts, without disrupting one-turn abilities as a result of\nexpressing more complex distributions.",

        "summary": "Language model capabilities predictably improve from scaling a model's size\nand training data. Motivated by this, increasingly large language models have\nbeen trained, yielding an array of impressive capabilities. Yet these models\nare vulnerable to adversarial prompts, such as \"jailbreaks\" that hijack models\nto perform undesired behaviors, posing a significant risk of misuse. Prior work\nindicates that computer vision models become more robust with model and data\nscaling, raising the question: does language model robustness also improve with\nscale? We study this question empirically, finding that larger models respond\nsubstantially better to adversarial training, but there is little to no benefit\nfrom model scale in the absence of explicit defenses.",

The shared task addresses\nbias and propaganda annotation in multilingual news posts. We focus on the\nearly days of the Israel War on Gaza as a case study. The task aims to foster\ncollaboration in developing annotation guidelines for subjective tasks by\ncreating frameworks for analyzing diverse narratives highlighting potential\nbias and propaganda. In a spirit of fostering and encouraging diversity, we\naddress the problem from a multilingual perspective, namely within five\nlanguages: English, French, Arabic, Hebrew, and Hindi. A total of 17 teams\nparticipated in two annotation subtasks: bias (16 teams) and propaganda (6\nteams). The teams competed in four evaluation tracks: guidelines development,\nannotation quality, annotation quantity, and consistency. Collectively, the\nteams produced 129,800 data points. Key findings and implications for the field\nare discussed.",
