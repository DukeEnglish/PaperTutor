1. Introduction
In recent years, the complexity of nonlinear systems has been increasing dramatically, and complex
systems often switch back and forth between normal and abnormal states. To maintain stability and
improve the system’s reliability, the key to improving system reliability is to find an efficient abnormal
state detection method that yields reliable failure probability results. Abnormal pattern switching of
complex systems can be caused by various factors such as parameter drift, which typically occurs during
system operation[1, 2], and unforeseen external forces involved such as the short condition in circuit
systems and the iterative rise and fall of economic markets. Nowadays, machine learning for abnormal
patterns of nonlinear complex systems has emerged as an engaging and challenging field in related fields.

systems. Itisimportanttonotethataneffectiveabnormaldetectionalgorithmshouldbehighlyaccurate

The abnormal detection and diagnosis problems related to time-dependent differential equations can

in industrial quality monitoring[15, 16]. The development and refinement of statistical analysis meth-
ods have led to significant progress in both theoretical and practical research applications, finding use
in various fields including biomedicine, pattern recognition, and econometrics[17]. The introduction of
statistical analysis algorithms is expected to bring new vitality to the traditional field of pattern recog-
nition and abnormal detection for complex nonlinear systems. After detecting and diagnosing outliers
in system output, evaluating complex systems for small abnormal probability failures is an important
topic in modern control theories, as the reliability of the system could be affected even by minor failures.
Various statistical sampling methods for the circuit system output have been proposed[18] but obtaining
actual probability values requires performing an extremely large number of simulation iterations which
leads to an infeasible huge computational burden[19]. Therefore, a more accurate and stable sampling
method is needed to estimate the failure probability of complex systems.
In this study, a statistical two-classification problem for complex system outputs was proposed to
transform abnormal detection and diagnosis into a more efficient and robust statistical algorithm. This
wasachievedbyintroducingtheGaussianmixturemodel(GMM)andthendevelopinganexceptionmax-
imization outlier detection method(EMODM) based on a two-state mixture model for time-series data
of the complex system output. Accurate abnormal detection was achieved for complex systems with ob-
servation noise using a finite mixture model. This method enabled effective abnormal detection through
2probability estimation in a short observation time segment with automatic online abnormal detection.
The paper is organized as follows. In section 2, the EMODM used for abnormal detection and
diagnosis by the complex system output is presented. In section 3, we present the numerical simulation

2. Exception Maximization Outlier Detection Method
In this section, we will introduce how the GMM in statistics and the associated Exception Maximiza-
tion(EM) algorithm can be extended into the EMODM which will be used in statistical inference and
abnormal pattern detection for the output of complex systems.
2.1. Complex System with Abnormal Pattern

and
f(t,x(t))=(f (t,x(t)),f (t,x(t)),··· ,f (t,x(t))), (2.3)
1 2 n
we could rewrite (2.1) as a vector form
dx(t)=f(t,x(t))dt, (2.4)
where f :Rn+1 →Rn with initial condition (t ,x )∈G⊂Rn+1.

of the equation 2.7 and treat it as a sample set for the EMODM.
2.2. Classification for Two-state Gaussian Mixture Model
To begin with, a two-component GMM is obtained by the random variable Y
Y ∼(1−η)N(µ ,σ2)+ηN(µ ,σ2), (2.9)
1 1 2 2
where η = 1−η is the proportion of time for correct working and η = η is the proportion of time for
1 2
working in an abnormal pattern. The density function of the Gaussian distribution is
1
(cid:26) (x−µ)2(cid:27)
f (x; µ,σ2)= √ exp − . (2.10)
N σ 2π 2σ2
Considering the existence of the random error in observation, the full-time observations of the whole
system model which has the correct and abnormal patterns are equivalent to a mixture of two Gaussian
submodels.
In our model, we assumed that N sample y = {y ,y ,··· ,y } in finite time [0,T] comes from a
1 2 N
finite GMM with two component. For each observation y can be attributed a latent label variable
i
4S = {S ,S ,··· ,S } and it takes value in finite state space I = {1,2}. So that S can only hold two
1 2 N t
values,specifyingthatk =1meansthesystemiscorrectlyworkingandtheoppositek =2indicatesthat
the system is abnormal. All observations y with label variable S = k come from the same Gaussian
i i
distribution N(µ ,σ2). The complete-data likelihood function defined earlier in (2.10) for GMM is
k k
K (cid:32) (cid:33)(cid:32) K (cid:33)
p(y,S|ϑ)= (cid:89) (cid:89) f (y ; µ ,σ2) (cid:89) ηNk(S) , (2.11)

where N (S) = #{S = k, i = 1,2,··· ,N} denotes the count assigned to class k of data y. Therefore

1 2 1 2
the complex system is in an abnormal pattern, it can be considered that K =2 in (2.11).
Both the observed variable y and the hidden variable S exist within the GMM. It is more difficult to
estimatemodelparametersdirectlyusingthemaximumlikelihoodmethodorBayesianwhenthereexists
ahiddenvariable. TheEMalgorithmcanthenbeusedtoefficientlyfindthemaximumlikelihoodsolution
of the parameters of a finite mixture model with latent variables. To implement the EM algorithm of
GMM, the complete data log-likelihood function p(y,S|ϑ) defined in (2.11) is rewritten as
N K
(cid:88)(cid:88) (cid:16) (cid:17)
logp(y,S|ϑ)= D log η f (y ; µ ,σ ) , (2.12)
ik k N i k k
i=1k=1
where the latent variable D is a 0/1 encoding of the assignment D =1 if and only if S =k.
ik ik i
The EM algorithm needs to start by determining the initial values of the model parameters ϑ{0} =
{µ{0},σ{0},η{0}, k = 1,2}. This algorithm for the two-component GMM model is iterated between the
k k
expectation step and the maximization step. The expectation step uses the parameter estimations of the
model from the previous step to calculate the conditional expectation of the log-likelihood function for
the complete data, and the estimate of the latent variable D in mth iteration is
ik
ηˆ{m−1}f (y ; µˆ{m−1},σˆ{m−1})
D{m} = k N i k k . (2.13)
ik (cid:80)K ηˆ{m−1}f (y ; µˆ{m−1},σˆ{m−1})

5Then in continuous iterations, until the algorithm converges, the final two-state GMM parameter esti-
mation is generated as
ϑˆ={µˆ ,µˆ ,σˆ ,σˆ ,ηˆ}. (2.16)

2.3. Online Outlier Detection and Abnormal Probability Estimation
By the assumption that outliers always have a small proportion, we regard the group with a small
proportion η of the two-state GMM as the output from a complex system in an abnormal pattern. By
Bayes theorem
ηp(y |µ ,σ )
p(S =2|y ,ϑ)= i 2 2 . (2.17)
i i (1−η)p(y |µ ,σ )+ηp(y |µ ,σ )

Then we can calculate a corresponding sequence of abnormal probabilities by (2.10). By setting certain
thresholds α , generally as a constant close to 1.

Then in this study, we define the abnormal pattern set as
Ferror ={e ; f(e )≥α , 1≤i≤N}. (2.18)

It can be updated at any time as the time series data continue to increase without a significant compu-
tational burden. Thereby realizing our online detection of abnormal patterns in complex systems.
At last, by statistical results due to our EMODM, the global abnormal probability of the circuit
system can be easily given as
P =ηˆ, (2.19)
f
which is the incidental result of GMM classification in (2.16). In this way, we can easily obtain the
evaluationfailureprobabilitywithoutusinganysamplingmethodsthusachievingreal-timeearlywarning
and abnormal probability estimation at high speed.
2.4. Convergence of Algorithm
LetP(Y|ϑ(i))bethelikelihoodfunctionofobserveddataY,ϑbeavariableandϑ(i) betheestimated
parameters of GMM as (2.16). Since
P(Y,S|ϑ)
P(Y|ϑ)= . (2.20)
P(S|Y,ϑ)
By logarithm derivation, we have
logP(Y|ϑ)=logP(Y,S|ϑ)−logP(S|Y,ϑ). (2.21)
Also, we have
(cid:88)
Q(ϑ,ϑi)= logP(S|Y,ϑ(i))logP(Y,S|ϑ). (2.22)
i:Si=k
6Set
(cid:88)
H(ϑ,ϑi)= logP(S|Y,ϑ(i))logP(S|Y,ϑ). (2.23)
i:Si=k
Then we can rewrite the log-likelihood formula as
logP(Y|ϑ)=Q(ϑ,ϑ(i))−H(ϑ,ϑ(i)). (2.24)
On substituting ϑ in (2.24) by ϑ(i) and ϑ(i+1), we have
logP(Y|ϑ(i+1))−logP(Y|ϑ(i))
(2.25)
=[Q(ϑ(i+1),ϑ(i))−Q(ϑ(i),ϑ(i))]−[H(ϑ(i+1),ϑ(i))−H(ϑ(i),ϑ(i))].
We can get the conclusion if (2.25) is non-negative on its right. Consequently, our task is to prove
non-negativity on its right. From the expectation step (2.14) of
(cid:88)
ϑ(i+1) =argmax logP(S|Y,ϑ(i))logP(Y,S|ϑ), (2.26)
ϑ
i:Si=k
we could deduce that
Q(ϑ(i+1),ϑ(i))−Q(ϑ(i),ϑ(i))≥0. (2.27)
As for the second, by (2.23) and Jensen inequality, it follows
H(ϑ(i+1),ϑ(i))−H(ϑ(i),ϑ(i))
(cid:32) (cid:33) (cid:33)
(cid:88) P(S|Y,ϑ(i+1))

P(S|Y,ϑ(i))
i:Si=k
(cid:32) (cid:33)
(cid:88)
=log P(S|Y,ϑ(i)) =0.
i:Si=k
At last, we can verify by (2.27) and (2.28) that P(Y|ϑ(i)) is monotonic increasing
P(Y|ϑ(i+1))≥P(Y|ϑ(i)). (2.29)
This illustrates the convergence of EMODM with P(Y|ϑ) ≤ 1. Finally, the EMODM algorithm is
summarized in algorithm 1.
3. Numerical Simulation
In this section, we evaluate the performance of our EMODM through two numerical simulations.
Two numerical cases are taken from two electronic components in microelectronics. The first case is the
Sallen-Key low-pass filter system which is a high-order linear system. The second case is the information

3.1. Sallen-Key Low-pass Filter
The Sallen-Key low-pass filter is a common electronic device in industrial circuit systems and its
structure is shown in figure 1. This filter was proposed in [20] and consists of a single operational
amplifier and a low-pass filter consisting of a resistance and a capacitance. The fault of the Sallen-Key
low-pass filter always causes the deterioration of the circuit and even leads to the collapse of the whole
system. Currently,awiderangeofabnormaldetectionanddiagnosismethodsfortheSallen-Keylow-pass

The following second-order linear ordinary differential equation represents the Sallen-Key low-pass
filter as follows:

where V denotes the excitation voltage which is the sine excitation voltage here, R , R represents the

resistance R1, R2, and C , C represents the capacitance C1, C2, respectively. Here, the Radau method
1 2
is a fully implicit method that is used to solve the differential equation, thus obtaining the simulation
results of the Sallen-Key low-pass filter circuit.
Based on the online abnormal detection EMODM proposed in section 2, we explore the ability of
our EMODM to implement fault detection. Through the Radau ordinary differential equation solver, we
begin our simulation experiment by getting the corresponding outputs according to the voltage of the
correct pattern and the voltage of the abnormal pattern separately. We generate 1000 pairs of results
9of the fault circuit and then obtain the mean value as the output result of the fault circuit at that time
period. The total time length of the simulation is 0.02s, and we divided it into 630 discrete time periods
including7unequal-lengthtimesegments. Intheglobalobservationtime,4segmentsinacorrectpattern
containing 600 time periods and 3 segments in the abnormal pattern containing 30 time periods. The
voltage value of the system is calculated at each discrete time period and then taken into the numerical
solver corresponding to the differential equation that obtains the response to the result of the circuit
system at the corresponding time.
Since the fault the large parameter drift of the circuit will cause the system to enter an abnormal

we obtain the estimated value at the corresponding time period. After repeating the above process and

the expressing formula is as follows
U =100sin(800πt). (3.2)

The outputs of the Sallen-Key low-pass filter circuit system with single-component voltage input are
shown on the left-hand side of figure 2. The red pentagons represent the probability of fault occurrence
and termination time points in the Sallen-Key low-pass filter circuit system.

in this study. The statistical inference results derived from the EMODM are shown in table 1. It can
be noticed that the abnormal pattern in two-state GMM always has a larger variance, so the probability
of generating outliers is greater. Meanwhile, the percentage of the abnormal time segment in the single-
component voltage and double-component voltage input experiment in the numerical simulation data is

of the time series data from the circuit output and the corresponding system abnormal probabilities to
obtain the fault diagnosis visualization results based on the EMODM for the Sallen-Key low-pass filter
circuit system with single-component voltage input shown on the right-hand side of figure 2. Note that

in a selected time segment containing an abnormal segment and demonstrates the magnified details of
the EMODM at a short local time segment in time periods 495-515. Based on the numerical modeling
of single-component voltage input circuit systems, we utilize the EMODM repeatedly to perform online
abnormal detection experiments by using the growing time series data in a selected local time segment
shown in figure 3 with the third abnormal time segment of time periods 501-510. In figure 4, we find
that the EMODM can already achieve real-time capture of faults within a delay of one observation time
of the fault occurrence. During the abnormal time segment, a new abnormal time segment is constantly
detected and an alarm signal could be immediately issued. Furthermore, the method would not continue
to incorrectly detect new abnormal time points after the circuit system reenters the correct pattern.
Furthermore, we consider a bit more complicated complex double-component voltage input. We set

formula is as follows
U =100sin(800πt)+100sin(1600πt). (3.3)

Its output is shown on the left-hand side of figure 5. The EMODM is used to detect potential faults in
the outputs of circuits with double-component voltage input as same as the previous single-component
voltage input experiment. The EMODM results for the Sallen-Key low-pass filter circuit system with
double-component voltage input are also shown in table 1. The results of the probabilistic visualization
based on the change rate of the circuit output are presented on the right-hand side of figure 5. The
percentage of the abnormal component mixture in the double-component voltage input experiment is
4.28% which is close to the real setting abnormal time percentage of 4.76%. It can be seen that the
performance of EMODM is degraded in complex situations but is completely acceptable. Since the same

in the complicated case was further verified.

3.2. Information Processing and Storing for Spin-magnet Circuits
In this case, we take the classical Landau-Liftshitz-Gilbert(LLG) equation which is closely related
to the information processing and storing in the device that uses spin currents and nanomagnets [23].

A typical example of that spin-magnet system mentioned above is the spin-transfer torque magnetic
random access memory(STT-MRAM) with fast write speed and other ideal properties[24]. Due to its
high-frequent spin-transfer for the information passing process, the write error rate of STT-MRAM is a
key factor that may significantly improve the reliability of the whole system[25]. Here, we implement
our EMODM on the LLG equation and accurately identify the abnormal pattern in that process. The

we set up only one abnormal time segment which contains 10 time periods and two correctly working

time segments containing 30 time periods and four correctly working time segments containing 170 time
periods. In both experiments, the current magnitude is set as 1.814e−4A and we generated the fault
caused by the random initial azimuth angle obeying Gaussian distribution N(π/4,π/12). The correct
output of instantaneous magnetization m⃗ of the LLG equation is shown in figure 7, where the initial
azimuth angle is π/4. The red pentagons represent the fault occurrence and termination time points in

There is usually corresponding Gaussian white noise when observing the circuit system. The obser-

of the EMODM under 1% Gaussian white noise disturbance. We followed the same procedure as in the
previous experiment. Here, we use the relative change rate of the output data from the system including

time segments in the circuit system were detected by our method. In single-fault and multi-fault experi-
ments,theglobalfaultdiagnosisrateindetectingtheoccurrenceoffaultsis100%. Understandardnoise

mental results is shown in figure 7 and 8. The red orbit represents the change rate of the instantaneous
magnetization m⃗ of the LLG equation and the blue orbit represents the abnormal probability given by
the EMODM. It can be seen that this method can capture abnormal time points continuously in the
abnormal output segment of the circuit system. No faults are falsely reported in the correct working
segments. TheEMODMiswelladaptedtocircuitoutputswithvaryingfeaturescausedbyfaults. There-
fore in this experiment, we verified the robustness and stability of the EMODM based on the noise data
of the nonlinear circuit system. Further by its online detection feature, people could receive an alarm
signal from the algorithm program as soon as it accurately captures the abnormal time point with its
16characterization.
4. Application in real-world datasets
In this section, our EMODM proposed in this paper for machine learning for complex systems with
an abnormal pattern has been experimentally verified in two real-world datasets on a 7kVA three-phase
three-wire inverter and the U.S. insured unemployment dataset.
4.1. 7kVA Three-phase Three-wire Inverter
The three-phase inverter includes a digital signal processor, a direct current power supply, three

4.2. U.S. Insured Unemployment Dataset
The economic market, as a complex system, follows certain patterns and undergoes endless cycles
of rise and fall over time[27]. The insured unemployment data in the U.S. serves as a crucial indicator
reflecting the fluctuations for economic markets[28]. During these dynamic processes, abnormal patterns
occasionallyemerge,asevidencedbythesignificantanomaliesinthedataduringtheCOVID-19pandemic

i
of the COVID-19 epidemic will be reflected in a change in functions f , in other words, this system
i
enters an anomalous pattern. This leads to a significant change in the system output. In this part,
we plan to statistically infer the abnormal pattern in the unemployment insurance dataset across the
53 regions in the U.S. from 2000-2024. The dataset is from Federal Reserve Economic Data(FRED) on
website https://fred.stlouisfed.org. We aim to further demonstrate the potential and importance
of EMODM in processing real-world data and in abnormal detection in complex systems.
In figure 13, the left figure displays the U.S. insured unemployment data across 53 regions from 2000
to 2024. Because the data in different regions varies significantly between regions, and to visualize all
data on a single graph, a logarithmic scale with base 10 was used. The figure reveals similar trends
across different regions, reflecting the cyclical nature of economic market fluctuations. Notably, there is
a discernible anomaly after 2020, corresponding to the widely known black swan event, the COVID-19

pandemic several years ago. This period of anomaly will be a primary focus for further data mining
using the EMODM. The middle figure aggregates the data from all regions to represent the nationwide
insured unemployment numbers in the U.S. It shows the overall trend of the economic market, which is
similar to the characterization of the left figure and highlights a clear anomaly after 2020. This anomaly
corresponds to the same period identified in the left plot, indicating a significant impact in the economic
market leading to an abnormal pattern due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We will reveal the shock of the
pandemictothiscomplexsystemintermsofthechangerateofsystemoutputdatawithitscorresponding

dataset. This figure is a statistical inference for the total data based on the middle figure. It illustrates
thataroundMarch21,2020,thecomplexsystemoftheU.S.insuredunemploymententeredanabnormal

AfterobtainingthestatisticalinferenceresultsfortheoveralldatainthewholeU.S.data, weapplied
the EMODM to the insured unemployment data for each of the 53 regions. For example, California is
locatedontheWestCoastoftheUnitedStates. Incontrast,NewYorkissituatedontheEastCoast. They
both have significant economic influence and large, diverse populations. In figure 14, the left and middle
figures, representing California and New York respectively, we observed that the system also entered an
abnormal mode around March 21, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, consistent with the results for
the total data in figure 13. However, in the right figure, which represents the U.S. Virgin Islands, we
21get different results. The U.S. Virgin Islands, due to its smaller population, lower economic volume, and
status as an overseas territory of the United States, shows data that is more susceptible to noise and
delayedeconomicimpacts. Consequently,thedetectionresultsforthisregionarelessaccurate. Sincethe
EMODM is based on probabilistic models and statistical algorithms, incorporating larger sample sizes
tends to yield more accurate results. The EMODM results for the other 50 regions are presented in
figure 15. In summary, while the EMODM effectively detected the COVID-19 induced anomalies in the
regions which have large economies and populations, its accuracy diminishes in smaller, more isolated
regions due to the small sample data which is susceptible to noise and delayed effects on their economic
markets. These results and figures collectively highlight the effectiveness of the EMODM in identifying
and analyzing abnormal patterns in complex systems, particularly in the context of significant economic
shocks such as the COVID-19 pandemic.
5. Comparison with Classical Methods
In this study, we proposed the EMODM, a novel fast online method for detecting abnormal patterns
intheoutputsofcomplexsystems. Utilizingprobabilisticmodelsandstatisticalalgorithms,theEMODM
is based on a two-state Gaussian mixture model, enabling it to perform probability anomaly detection
on real-time raw data without relying on special prior distribution information. We have chosen the
numerical solution shown in figure 2 in section 3 about the Sallen-Key low-pass filter model with single-
component voltage input as the data used for the testing of each method. The result of comparing
EMODM with other classical methods is presented in table 6.
Comparatively, various outlier detection algorithms each have unique strengths and weaknesses. The
linear regression model(LRM) is simple and effective for trend analysis and continuous data, but it as-
sumes a predefined model structure, making them less suitable for complex distributions[29]. The kernel
Density Estimation(KDE) is non-parametric and does not assume a specific distribution, but it can be
computationally intensive, especially in high dimensions[30]. The k-nearest neighbors(KNN) algorithm
is intuitive and does not require assumptions about data distribution, yet its high computational com-
plexity and sensitivity to the choice of the component number can be limitations[31]. The local outlier
factor(LOF) captures local data density variations effectively, making it suitable for data with distinct
density variations, though its performance degrades with high-dimensional data[32]. The K-means clus-
tering is simple and effective for identifying cluster-based anomalies but requires the number of clusters
tobepredefined,andislesseffectivefornon-sphericalclusters[33]. Theisolationforest(IF)isefficientfor
high-dimensional data and identifies anomalies based on fewer required cuts to isolate them[34]. How-
ever, it assumes anomalies are few and significantly different from normal data. The recurrent neural
networks(RNN) and the generative adversarial networks(GAN) offer powerful capabilities for sequential
andhigh-dimensionaldata, respectively[35,36]. TheRNNisparticularlysuitedfortime-seriesdatawith
22Figure15: EMODMResultsforInsuredUnemploymentDatainotherregions.
23temporal dependencies but requires substantial training data and computational resources. The GAN is
powerful for modeling complex, high-dimensional data distributions and generating synthetic data, but
they both require extensive computational resources and hyperparameter tuning, along with complex
model training processes.
Each of these outlier detection algorithms is suited for different types of data and specific scenarios.
The choice of algorithm should be guided by the specific characteristics and requirements of the data
and application at hand. The EMODM, with its effectiveness in real-time anomaly detection in complex
systems with Gaussian noise, proves to be a robust tool in the suite of outlier detection methodologies,
particularly for large-scale and noisy datasets. Future work could explore further optimization of the
EMODM for smaller datasets and its application to a broader range of complex systems, potentially
integrating it with other advanced machine learning techniques to enhance its detection capabilities and
robustness.

24These applications demonstrated the method’s effectiveness and accuracy in both synthetic and real-life
datasets.
Our results highlight that EMODM is capable of providing reliable outlier detection in complex
systems affected by noise. This capability is crucial for maintaining system stability and reliability,
especially in scenarios where traditional methods may fall short due to the need for prior knowledge or
linear assumptions. Future work could explore further optimization of the EMODM for smaller datasets
anditsapplicationtoabroaderrangeofcomplexsystems. Additionally,integratingEMODMwithother
advanced machine learning techniques may enhance its detection capabilities and robustness, paving the
way for more comprehensive anomaly detection solutions in various fields.
