        "summary": "Collaborative Perception (CP) has shown great potential to achieve more\nholistic and reliable environmental perception in intelligent unmanned systems\n(IUSs). However, implementing CP still faces key challenges due to the\ncharacteristics of the CP task and the dynamics of wireless channels. In this\narticle, a task-oriented wireless communication framework is proposed to\njointly optimize the communication scheme and the CP procedure. We first\npropose channel-adaptive compression and robust fusion approaches to extract\nand exploit the most valuable semantic information under wireless communication\nconstraints. We then propose a task-oriented distributed scheduling algorithm\nto identify the best collaborators for CP under dynamic environments. The main\nidea is learning while scheduling, where the collaboration utility is\neffectively learned with low computation and communication overhead. Case\nstudies are carried out in connected autonomous driving scenarios to verify the\nproposed framework. Finally, we identify several future research directions.",

        "summary": "Sample efficiency remains a key challenge in multi-agent reinforcement\nlearning (MARL). A promising approach is to learn a meaningful latent\nrepresentation space through auxiliary learning objectives alongside the MARL\nobjective to aid in learning a successful control policy. In our work, we\npresent MAPO-LSO (Multi-Agent Policy Optimization with Latent Space\nOptimization) which applies a form of comprehensive representation learning\ndevised to supplement MARL training. Specifically, MAPO-LSO proposes a\nmulti-agent extension of transition dynamics reconstruction and self-predictive\nlearning that constructs a latent state optimization scheme that can be\ntrivially extended to current state-of-the-art MARL algorithms. Empirical\nresults demonstrate MAPO-LSO to show notable improvements in sample efficiency\nand learning performance compared to its vanilla MARL counterpart without any\nadditional MARL hyperparameter tuning on a diverse suite of MARL tasks.",

        "summary": "Traffic signal control (TSC) is a promising low-cost measure to enhance\ntransportation efficiency without affecting existing road infrastructure. While\nvarious reinforcement learning-based TSC methods have been proposed and\nexperimentally outperform conventional rule-based methods, none of them has\nbeen deployed in the real world. An essential gap lies in the\noversimplification of the scenarios in terms of intersection heterogeneity and\nroad network intricacy. To make TSC applicable in urban traffic management, we\ntarget TSC coordination in city-scale high-authenticity road networks, aiming\nto solve the three unique and important challenges: city-level scalability,\nheterogeneity of real-world intersections, and effective coordination among\nintricate neighbor connections. Since optimizing multiple agents in a\nparameter-sharing paradigm can boost the training efficiency and help achieve\nscalability, we propose our method, CityLight, based on the well-acknowledged\noptimization framework, parameter-sharing MAPPO. To ensure the unified policy\nnetwork can learn to fit large-scale heterogeneous intersections and tackle the\nintricate between-neighbor coordination, CityLight proposes a universal\nrepresentation module that consists of two key designs: heterogeneous\nintersection alignment and neighborhood impact alignment for coordination. To\nfurther boost coordination, CityLight adopts neighborhood-integrated rewards to\ntransition from achieving local optimal to global optimal. Extensive\nexperiments on datasets with hundreds to tens of thousands of real-world\nintersections and authentic traffic demands validate the surprising\neffectiveness and generalizability of CityLight, with an overall performance\ngain of 11.66% and a 22.59% improvement in transfer scenarios in terms of\nthroughput.",

        "summary": "Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) heavily rely on a variety of\nwell-designed benchmarks, which provide environmental platforms and consistent\ncriteria to evaluate existing and novel algorithms. Specifically, in\nmulti-agent RL (MARL), a plethora of benchmarks based on cooperative games have\nspurred the development of algorithms that improve the scalability of\ncooperative multi-agent systems. However, for the competitive setting, a\nlightweight and open-sourced benchmark with challenging gaming dynamics and\nvisual inputs has not yet been established. In this work, we present\nFightLadder, a real-time fighting game platform, to empower competitive MARL\nresearch. Along with the platform, we provide implementations of\nstate-of-the-art MARL algorithms for competitive games, as well as a set of\nevaluation metrics to characterize the performance and exploitability of\nagents. We demonstrate the feasibility of this platform by training a general\nagent that consistently defeats 12 built-in characters in single-player mode,\nand expose the difficulty of training a non-exploitable agent without human\nknowledge and demonstrations in two-player mode. FightLadder provides\nmeticulously designed environments to address critical challenges in\ncompetitive MARL research, aiming to catalyze a new era of discovery and\nadvancement in the field.
