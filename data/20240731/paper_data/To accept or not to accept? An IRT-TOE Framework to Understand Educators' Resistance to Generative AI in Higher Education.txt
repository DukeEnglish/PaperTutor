Abstract: Since the public release of Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT), extensive discourse has
emerged concerning the potential advantages and challenges of integrating Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI)
into education. In the realm of information systems, research on technology adoption is crucial for understanding the
diverse factors influencing the uptake of specific technologies. Theoretical frameworks, refined and validated over
decades, serve as guiding tools to elucidate the individual and organizational dynamics, obstacles, and perceptions
surrounding technology adoption. However, while several models have been proposed, they often prioritize elucidating
the factors that facilitate acceptance over those that impede it, typically focusing on the student perspective and leaving
a gap in empirical evidence regarding educators’ viewpoints. Given the pivotal role educators play in higher education,
this study aims to develop a theoretical model to empirically predict the barriers preventing educators from adopting
GenAI in their classrooms. Acknowledging the lack of theoretical models tailored to identifying such barriers, our
approach is grounded in the Innovation Resistance Theory (IRT) framework and augmented with constructs from the
Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework. This model is transformed into a measurement instrument
employing a quantitative approach, complemented by a qualitative approach to enrich the analysis and uncover
concerns related to GenAI adoption in the higher education domain.
1 Introduction
Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), a type of artificial intelligence (AI) systems, excels at generating diverse
content, thereby offering unprecedented capabilities, however, raising ethical concerns regarding disinformation,
accuracy, bias, privacy, and ownership [7, 9, 12, 6]. Academic institutions responded swiftly due to concerns about
misuse, particularly academic fraud. Some governments restricted or even banned ChatGPT [35, 18], while others
provided guidelines for its ethical use [1]. Digital technology in education, including AI systems, addresses challenges
such as those posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and aims to enhance learning experiences [14], potentially
contributing to the Education 5.0 movement. However, integrating such technology requires understanding both its
benefits and challenges. Research typically emphasizes identifying factors facilitating acceptance rather than barriers
hindering it [28, 29, 15, 11, 30], crucial for promoting responsible adoption. This focus often centers on the student
perspective, neglecting empirical evidence on educators’ views, who are key actors in the educational ecosystem.
Furthermore, research tends to concentrate solely on ChatGPT, disregarding other GenAI tools (see Section 2).
This study aims to develop a theoretical model to empirically predict barriers hindering educators from adopting
GenAI in their classrooms. Considering a lack of models focusing on these barriers, the developed model integrates
Innovation Resistance Theory (IRT) with elements of the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE)
framework.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides background, Section 3 presents the model
and methodology, while Section 4 concludes the paper.This paper has been accepted for publication In Proceedings of the International Workshop on AI in Education and

2 Background
To study technology adoption, researchers widely use various models and theories to understand factors influencing
an individual’s decision to adopt technology. In this context, technology acceptance refers to perceived usefulness
and attitudes towards a technology, considered a preliminary step to technology adoption, defined as actual
technology use [13].
Research in this field has produced many empirically validated models over decades. Some theories focus on the
perception-based pre-adoption phase, primarily using the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), which argues that
perceptions drive actions [26]. However, Schwartz et al. [26] criticize the field for overlooking post-adoption
perspectives lack of examination on why technology adoption is resisted. These gaps hinder a holistic understanding
of motives towards certain technologies, particularly reluctance towards their adoption.
Prominent theories used in technology acceptance research include Technology Acceptance Model (TAM),
Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), and
Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE).
TAM posits that user attitude towards a system is the most accurate predictor of actual use, which is based on
perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, emphasizing user perception [10].
UTAUT [32] claims the likelihood of adopting a technology depends on performance expectancy, effort expectancy,
social influence, and facilitating conditions. UTAUT2 added hedonic motivation, price value, and habit to the model
[33].
TPB predicts and explains human behavior through perception, attitude, and control over behavior [2]. It improves
upon the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA), focusing on intention driven by attitude, subjective norm, and perceived
behavioral control.
TOE framework posits that technology adoption in organizations is influenced by the characteristics of the
technology, the organizational context, and the external environment [21].
While these models are valuable for understanding factors that facilitate technology acceptance, they do not primarily
focus on identifying barriers to adoption. Understanding both acceptance and resistance aspects is essential for a
comprehensive view of technology integration. Innovation Resistance Theory (IRT) plays a crucial role in
understanding barriers and resistance factors overlooked by TAM, UTAUT, TOE, and TPB.
IRT aims to explain consumer response to innovation and why some innovations are met with resistance [22].
According to Ram, resistance is a natural response to change and products that respond to the sources of resistance are
more likely to overcome the resistance barriers [22]. IRT accounts for functional and psychological barriers, where
functional barriers are associated with value, patterns and risks associated with product use, while psychological barriers
are related to the traditions, norms, and perceptions of the customer [23]. According to IRT, three major groups of
factors affect innovation resistance: (1) perceived innovation characteristics, (2) consumer characteristics and (3)
characteristics of propagation mechanisms. The theory has its roots in business and marketing research and contrary to
the previous models and frameworks introduced in this section, IRT attempts to understand why consumers or
organizations reject technology instead of embracing it.
Transitioning to the current state of research on GenAI adoption, our investigation delved into existing studies
through a systematic literature review (SLR). While we do not present the SLR findings in this paper due to its
peripheral role, it is accessible on Zenodo - 10.5281/zenodo.13122996. The analysis revealed that the majority of
existing research predominantly focuses on ChatGPT as the GenAI tool of choice [28, 29, 15, 11, 30, 3] (as of
December 2023), which is unsurprising. However, it also underscores a research gap, indicating the necessity to
encompass a broader range of GenAI tools.
Most studies focus on students as their primary group [28, 29, 15, 11, 30], with only one study focusing on academics
[3]. The most popular technology adoption model in these studies was UTAUT, with two studies using the updated
UTAUT2 [28, 29], and one using the original version [15]. Additionally, two studies employed TAM [11, 30], and one
used Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) as its theoretical foundation [3]. Existing studies have primarily examined factors
affecting the acceptance of GenAI technology, neglecting research on resistance, barriers, and limitations to adoption.
This aligns with [25], emphasizing the need to understand why technology adoption is resisted—a perspective largely
overlooked.
Research on the adoption of GenAI tools by academics and educators is notably limited. Doung et al. [11] haveThis paper has been accepted for publication In Proceedings of the International Workshop on AI in Education and

Educators’ Resistance to Generative AI in Higher Education” In Proceedings of the International
Workshop on AI in Education and Educational Research (AIEER)
called for such research, which is particularly relevant in settings where educators have the final say on the use of these
technologies (e.g., Estonian higher education). Given the identified research gaps, this study aims to explore GenAI
adoption through the lens of resistance and educator perception, thereby being unique in all three components.
3 Model development
The study aims to uncover barriers hindering academics and higher education staff from adopting GenAI tools in
classrooms. To this end, we develop a model integrating Innovation Resistance Theory (IRT) with Technology-
Organization-Environment (TOE) constructs, considering both individual sentiment and organizational context.
The model, rooted in IRT, is expanded with Organization and Environment constructs from TOE to incorporate
institutional and external factors. The Technology construct is omitted to prevent redundancy as IRT captures the
potential limitations of the technology from the perspective of the user.
Let us introduce the model’s constructs (Fig. 1), where hypotheses and measurement items (Table 1) are
formulated based on the underlying constructs and theory, existing research, and assumptions drawn from the
current state of the art, providing a structured approach to hypothesis development.
3.1 Hypotheses development
The initial reception of GenAI by the education community can be perceived negative as implies from several bans
and concerns of cheating conveyed through mainstream media [7, 9, 5, 35]. This leads us to H1: More than half of
educators prohibit the use of GenAI tools in their courses.
The first of the psychological barriers in IRT – the tradition barrier (TB) – refers to the psychological impact of
an innovation’s deviation from the established traditions or societal norms of its user [23]. The intent to maintain
existing processes and norms affects openness to change as change presents a threat to the status quo. The tradition
barrier signifies resistance to change stemming from entrenched norms and practices, which Shills defines as
"anything which is handed down from past to present" [27, p. 112]. Academic institutions, proud of their traditions
and heritage, are often resistant to change, driven by concerns over disrupting established processes, workload
implications, and distrust towards administration [4]. This reluctance is compounded by the autonomy of teaching
staff. Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) echoes these concerns, suggesting that
they may challenge traditional teaching methods and alter perceptions of education, impacting student engagement
[20]. Consequently, we define H2: Tradition barrier has a positive effect on academics’ resistance towards the
adoption of GenAI within the academic environment.
The image barrier (IB) addresses how users perceive an innovation’s impact on their social image or identity
[23]. Bin-Nashwan et al. [3] exemplify this through academics’ negative sentiment towards ChatGPT, driven by
their dedication to academic integrity, which is integral to their personal reputation and self-identity. Consequently,
we define H3: Image barrier has a positive effect on academics’ resistance towards the adoption of GenAI within
the academic environment.
The risk barrier (RB) encompasses the emotions stemming from uncertainty, unintended outcomes, or side-
effects of innovation, categorized into physical, economic, functional, and social risks [23]. In the context of GenAI
in higher education, concerns about academic fraud and cheating are prominent. Kasneci et al. highlight various
issues, including overreliance, adaptability, and output verification, associated with GenAI use in education [16].
Additionally, GenAI tools are perceived as susceptible to producing inaccurate information and bias [16, 24].
Considering these risks, academics may resist GenAI adoption within the academic environment. For instance, the
potential inaccuracy of credit point representations due to significant assistance from GenAI tools could impact the
perceived value of students’ efforts, rendering current estimations inaccurate. This leads us to H4: Risk barrier has
a positive effect on academics’ resistance towards the adoption of GenAI within the academic environment.
The usage barrier (UB) represents resistance to innovation when it clashes with existing workflows, practices,
and habits [23]. In the context of GenAI in education, one significant issue is the challenge of discerning GenAI-
generated outputs from student-produced work [16]. This poses difficulties in evaluating students’ knowledge
against course learning outcomes, as exemplified by the deprecation of essays as an evaluation method due to
students’ ability to generate them easily with GenAI tools. Addressing this challenge requires educators to adapt andThis paper has been accepted for publication In Proceedings of the International Workshop on AI in Education and

Kalmus, J., Nikiforova, A. (2024). “To accept or not to accept? An IRT-TOE Framework to Understand
Educators’ Resistance to Generative AI in Higher Education” In Proceedings of the International
Workshop on AI in Education and Educational Research (AIEER)
improve evaluation methods [19] as done by a number of top-ranked universities worldwide, which may demand
significant effort depending on course content and structure. Moreover, the usage barrier encompasses the
incompatibility of GenAI within specific courses, such as language courses focused on reading and writing, where
GenAI capabilities may exceed course requirements. Thus, H5 Usage barrier has a positive effect on academics’
resistance towards the adoption of GenAI within the academic environment.
The value barrier (VB) asserts that customers are unlikely to embrace a product if its performance does not
justify its cost [23]. In the educational context, educators lack control over financial decisions affecting students’
access to GenAI tools. Therefore, this study considers the value barrier from the perspective of the intrinsic value of
the technology in education—whether its use in courses provides any value to students at all.
Effective technology integration in education necessitates equal access for all students, ensuring digital equity in
classrooms [8, 12]. Historically, concerns about access and equity have been raised regarding the widespread
availability of the internet in education [17], similar to the adoption of GenAI. Educators recognize the benefits of
technology but emphasize the importance of equal availability and access. Within this barrier, it’s crucial to weigh the
required effort against the technology’s potential benefits in a given course. Considering these factors allows for a more
holistic understanding of the value barrier within this study’s context. This leads us to H6: Value barrier has a positive
effect on academics’ resistance towards the adoption of GenAI within the academic environment.
The organizational context (OB) within the TOE framework considers how an organization’s staff, internal structure,
and processes influence the adoption of technology [31]. In this study, organization refers to the educational
institutions where educators are employed. Webb and Cox identified that for effective technology integration in
classrooms, teachers require knowledge on how to effectively incorporate these technologies into teaching practices
[34]. Institutions may need to provide additional support to educators in the form of knowledge sharing, training, and
guidelines to facilitate these changes. Additionally, educators may feel pressured to adopt these tools due to their
increasing popularity and promotion as the future of education, which could lead to resistance. This leads us to H7 -
Organisational context has a positive effect on academics’ resistance towards the adoption of GenAI within the
academic environment.
The environment context (EB) within the TOE framework considers the impact of external variables such as
regulation, market conditions, and societal and cultural factors [31]. Various governmental restrictions have been
observed on the use of ChatGPT since their public availability. For example, Italy initially prohibited the use of
ChatGPT over privacy concerns [18], and local governments in Australia and the United States also imposed restrictions
on its use in education [5, 35]. These examples highlight the susceptibility of GenAI technology to government
regulation. Additionally, educators may feel pressured to integrate GenAI tools into their courses due to the
technology’s popularity and its increasing use in other fields, which could lead to resistance. This leads us to H8:
Environment context has a positive effect on academics’ resistance towards the adoption of GenAI within the academic
environment.
3.2 Model
The developed model (see Figure 1) uses the constructs of the IRT and the Environment and Organisation
constructs of the TOE models to capture the potential resistance sentiment of educators towards GenAI tools use in
the classroom. The model uses demographic variables – gender, age, university, academic field – as control
variables.This paper has been accepted for publication In Proceedings of the International Workshop on AI in Education and

Workshop on AI in Education and Educational Research (AIEER)
Figure 1. Consolidated theoretical model.
We propose a mixed-method approach to validate the hypotheses and refine the developed theoretical model.
Utilizing Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) and statistical analysis, the quantitative method will test the
accuracy of the model and identify potential areas for improvement. To gain deeper insights, we recommend
complementing this with qualitative data collection, which is expected to be analyzed using response coding
technique.
To this end, we develop a questionnaire for data collection (available on Zenodo - 10.5281/zenodo.13122996),
which also gathers qualitative insights from educators on their perspectives regarding GenAI use. The survey is
divided into three sections: (1) demographic profile, (2) core measurement instrument, and (3) additional questions.
This mixed-method approach ensures a robust analysis and a comprehensive understanding of the factors
influencing GenAI adoption in education.
The demographic profile section focuses on collecting demographic data related to gender, age range, university,
and general academic field. In addition to the initial closed-ended questions aimed at recording the respondents’
demographic profile, two additional closed-ended questions are included in the general information section: Do
you allow students to use GenAI in your courses? Do you use GenAI in your academic work?This paper has been accepted for publication In Proceedings of the International Workshop on AI in Education and

Workshop on AI in Education and Educational Research (AIEER)
The first question is used to capture data for the H1. To reflect the sentiment towards using GenAI tools in courses
more accurately, the possible answers are: No, Allow, and Recommend. The second question gathers information on the
number of educators using GenAI in their academic work, helping to distinguish between respondents with prior
experience using the tools and those whose perceptions may be influenced by a lack of familiarity with GenAI.
The second part of the questionnaire contains the measurement instrument consisting of 31 measurement items (see
Table 1) derived from the constructs they are associated with based on existing research and underlying theory,
wherein measurement items are measured using a five-point Likert scale.
Table 1. Developed measurement instrument
TB1: Student use of GenAI reduces student participation in traditional course delivery methods

E2: Current government policy does not support student GenAI use
E3: My institution expects me to allow students use GenAI tools in my courses
E4: Students expect me to allow them use GenAI tools in my courses
The questionnaire is complemented with open-ended questions to gain a descriptive insight into the general sentiment
of educators towards GenAI, covering multiple aspects of educators’ personal experience with GenAI from personal
use to necessary adjustments in courses.This paper has been accepted for publication In Proceedings of the International Workshop on AI in Education and

The third section includes optional open-ended questions to provide respondents with a platform for a more nuanced
interpretation of results. These questions inquire:
• Are there any additional challenges associated with letting students use GenAI in your course(s) that were
not covered by this study?
• What kind of tasks in your courses are most affected by the use of GenAI?
• How would you describe your own experience of using GenAI tools?
• Have you already integrated the use of GenAI in your course(s)?
• What were the adaptations you already did to integrate GenAI use in your course(s)?
The instrument was subject to iterative expert review throughout its development process to improve the quality of the
measurement items. Reviews were performed by two experts from the domains of technology acceptance research and
modern educational theory. The instrument is made available on Zenodo - 10.5281/zenodo.13122996.
4 Conclusion
This study proposes a novel theoretical model aimed to uncover barriers preventing academic staff from adopting
GenAI tools in their courses. Drawing on constructs from Innovation Resistance Theory (IRT) and Technology-
Organization-Environment (TOE), it examines individual, organizational, and environmental aspects to empirically
assess potential resistance to GenAI use by students. Utilizing these constructs and the state of the art, we define eight
hypotheses regarding resistance to GenAI use in higher education. The model is transformed into a measurement
instrument that employs quantitative and qualitative approaches to enrich the analysis and discover concerns related to
GenAI adoption in higher education.
Future research is recommended to validate the developed model in real-world settings with its further refinement.
As such, we are currently applying the model in Estonian higher education settings to examine whether academic staff
in Estonia, known as a "digital nation" and early adopters of emerging technologies like GenAI, are reluctant to allow
students to use GenAI tools, identifying concerns related to GenAI adoption in higher education.
The study contributes to the research by proposing a novel theoretical model that addresses the often-neglected
perspective of technology resistance. It is one of the first to encompass educators’ viewpoints as integral to the
educational ecosystem. However, while we cover a neglected perspective, further research would benefit from unifying
student and educator perspectives to comprehensively understand factors affecting GenAI adoption in higher
education.
