        "summary": "This paper discusses a cooperative strategy for capturing a target using\nmultiple pursuers in a planar scenario. Given an initial position distribution\nof pursuers, the Voronoi Diagram is employed to characterize the target's\nproximity region. The key idea is to dynamically shape that region using a\npolicy that directs its vertices towards its instantaneous centroid. Analysis\nof the resulting dynamics deduces the velocity control inputs for the pursuers.\nAs the main result, target's proximity region is shown to shrink exponentially\nirrespective of its speed and evasion policy. Simulation results demonstrate\nthe characteristics of the proposed method.",

        "summary": "In wireless communication-based formation control systems, the control\nperformance is significantly impacted by the channel capacity of each\ncommunication link between agents. This relationship, however, remains\nunder-investigated in the existing studies. To address this gap, the formation\ncontrol problem of classical second-order multi-agent systems with bounded\nprocess noises was considered taking into account the channel capacity. More\nspecifically, the model of communication links between agents is first\nestablished, based on a new concept -- guaranteed communication region, which\ncharacterizes all possible locations for successful message decoding in the\npresent of control-system uncertainty. Furthermore, we rigorously prove that,\nthe guaranteed communication region does not unboundedly increase with the\ntransmission time, which indicates an important trade-off between the\nguaranteed communication region and the data rate. The fundamental limits of\ndata rate for any desired accuracy are also obtained. Finally, the integrated\ndesign to achieve the desired formation accuracy is proposed, where an\nestimation-based controller and transmit power control strategy are developed.",

        "summary": "Communication-constrained algorithms for decentralized learning and\noptimization rely on local updates coupled with the exchange of compressed\nsignals. In this context, differential quantization is an effective technique\nto mitigate the negative impact of compression by leveraging correlations\nbetween successive iterates. In addition, the use of error feedback, which\nconsists of incorporating the compression error into subsequent steps, is a\npowerful mechanism to compensate for the bias caused by the compression. Under\nerror feedback, performance guarantees in the literature have so far focused on\nalgorithms employing a fusion center or a special class of contractive\ncompressors that cannot be implemented with a finite number of bits. In this\nwork, we propose a new decentralized communication-efficient learning approach\nthat blends differential quantization with error feedback. The approach is\nspecifically tailored for decentralized learning problems where agents have\nindividual risk functions to minimize subject to subspace constraints that\nrequire the minimizers across the network to lie in low-dimensional subspaces.\nThis constrained formulation includes consensus or single-task optimization as\nspecial cases, and allows for more general task relatedness models such as\nmultitask smoothness and coupled optimization. We show that, under some general\nconditions on the compression noise, and for sufficiently small step-sizes\n$\\mu$, the resulting communication-efficient strategy is stable both in terms\nof mean-square error and average bit rate: by reducing $\\mu$, it is possible to\nkeep the estimation errors small (on the order of $\\mu$) without increasing\nindefinitely the bit rate as $\\mu\\rightarrow 0$. The results establish that, in\nthe small step-size regime and with a finite number of bits, it is possible to\nattain the performance achievable in the absence of compression.",

        "summary": "Multiscale models provide a unique tool for studying complex processes that\nstudy events occurring at different scales across space and time. In the\ncontext of biological systems, such models can simulate mechanisms happening at\nthe intracellular level such as signaling, and at the extracellular level where\ncells communicate and coordinate with other cells. They aim to understand the\nimpact of genetic or environmental deregulation observed in complex diseases,\ndescribe the interplay between a pathological tissue and the immune system, and\nsuggest strategies to revert the diseased phenotypes. The construction of these\nmultiscale models remains a very complex task, including the choice of the\ncomponents to consider, the level of details of the processes to simulate, or\nthe fitting of the parameters to the data. One additional difficulty is the\nexpert knowledge needed to program these models in languages such as C++ or\nPython, which may discourage the participation of non-experts. Simplifying this\nprocess through structured description formalisms -- coupled with a graphical\ninterface -- is crucial in making modeling more accessible to the broader\nscientific community, as well as streamlining the process for advanced users.\nThis article introduces three examples of multiscale models which rely on the\nframework PhysiBoSS, an add-on of PhysiCell that includes intracellular\ndescriptions as continuous time Boolean models to the agent-based approach. The\narticle demonstrates how to easily construct such models, relying on PhysiCell\nStudio, the PhysiCell Graphical User Interface.

        "summary": "Agent-based models describing social interactions among individuals can help\nto better understand emerging macroscopic patterns in societies. One of the\ntopics which is worth tackling is the formation of different kinds of\nhierarchies that emerge in social spaces such as cities. Here we propose a\nBonabeau-like model by adding a second class of agents. The fundamental\nparticularity of our model is that only a pairwise interaction between agents\nof the opposite class is allowed. Agent fitness can thus only change by\ncompetition among the two classes, while the total fitness in the society\nremains constant. The main result is that for a broad range of values of the\nmodel parameters, the fitness of the agents of each class show a decay in time\nexcept for one or very few agents which capture almost all the fitness in the\nsociety. Numerical simulations also reveal a singular shift from egalitarian to\nhierarchical society for each class. This behaviour depends on the control\nparameter $\\eta$, playing the role of the inverse of the temperature of the\nsystem. Results are invariant with regard to the system size, contingent solely\non the quantity of agents within each class. Finally, a couple of scaling laws\nare provided thus showing a data collapse from different model parameters and\nthey follow a shape which can be related to the presence of a phase transition\nin the model.",
