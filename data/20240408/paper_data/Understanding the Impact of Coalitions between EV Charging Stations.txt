Abstract
The rapid growth of electric vehicles (EVs) is driving the expansion of charging infrastruc-
ture globally. This expansion, however, places significant charging demand on the electricity
grid, impacting grid operations and electricity pricing. While coordination among all charging
stations is beneficial, it may not be always feasible. However, a subset of charging stations,
whichcouldbejointlyoperatedbyacompany,couldcoordinatetodecidetheirchargingprofile.
Inthispaperweinvestigatewhethersuchcoalitionsbetweenchargingstationsisbetterthanno
coordination.
We model EV charging as a non-cooperative aggregative game, where each station’s cost is
determined by both monetary payments tied to reactive electricity prices on the grid and its
sensitivity to deviations from a nominal charging profile. We consider a solution concept that
we call C-Nash equilibrium, which is tied to a coalition C of charging stations coordinating to
reduce their costs. We provide sufficient conditions, in terms of the demand and sensitivity
of charging stations, to determine when independent (uncoordinated) operation of charging
stations could result in lower overall costs to charging stations, the coalition, and charging
stations outside the coalition. Somewhat counter to intuition, we demonstrate scenarios where
allowing charging stations to operate independently is better than coordinating as a coalition.

The proliferation of electric vehicles (EVs) has brought major changes to road transportation. EVs
could play a significant role in the transition to a sustainable energy-based future and are projected
to surpass traditional internal combustion engine-based vehicles in the coming decades(Bloomberg,
2021). The growth in EVs has led to the genesis of a new ecosystem around building faster and
more accessible charging infrastructure (Brown et al., 2024). However, there are several challenges
associated with the design of charging infrastructure, including the distribution and affordability of
publicchargingandintegratingnewinfrastructureintothecurrentelectricitygrid(Kampshoffetal.,
2022). One such major challenge is that charging stations, especially fast-charging stations, draw
a considerable amount of electricity when in operation (America, 2021; EVgo, 2021; Tesla, 2019,
2021) and may adversely impact the grid infrastructure (Alexeenko and Bitar, 2023; Escudero-
Garzas and Seco-Granados, 2012; Lee et al., 2014). The ideal solution to this challenge is to
coordinate the demands from all charging stations to distribute the load on the grid (Alexeenko
and Bitar, 2023; Obeid et al., 2023). However, this is hard to implement in practice due to the
high communication and computational costs of such centralized approaches, and concerns about
privacy of the information shared by EV charging stations (Brown et al., 2024).
Given the impracticality of achieving global coordination among EV charging stations in most
cases, we consider coordination between a subset of charging stations, forming strategic coali-
tions. These coalitions can be organically fostered by emerging electric vehicle charging companies
(EVCCs)likeTesla,EVgo,andChargepoint,eachofwhichoverseesmultiplechargingstations(refer
Figure 1 for a pictorial depiction). Although it may appear intuitive that any level of coordination
is preferable to none at all, we present counter-examples to illustrate that this is not always valid.
This solicits further analysis of the regime between no and full coordination of charging stations.
We use an aggregative game theoretic model to study the interaction between charging stations
in the energy market. Charging stations can have heterogeneous charging demands, which they
require to be fulfilled from the grid over a finite time horizon. We model each charging station to
havenominal chargingprofileoverthistimewindow. Furthermore,eachchargingstationisstrategic
and wants to minimize its cost comprising of (i) a monetary payment for power demanded from the
grid, and (ii) the deviations from their desired operating charging profile. We allow the charging
stations to have heterogeneous sensitivities to deviation from their nominal charging profile. Since
charging stations can have a large demand from the grid, we model them as “price-makers”, and

downtown, highway) and owned by different companies (e.g. Tesla, Chargepoint). Each charging
station demands charge from the grid, which determines the prices.
not “price-takers” (Deori et al., 2017; Gan et al., 2012; Ma et al., 2011; Paccagnan et al., 2018).
Specifically, we model the unit power price to be contingent upon the aggregate power demanded
by all charging stations.
Under this modeling framework, we study the following question in our paper:
Q: Could coordination between a few charging stations lead to undesirable conse-
quences?
To answer this question, we compare two separate scenarios: (a) when charging stations form
a coalition (e.g., the charging stations owned by an EVCC), to optimize their combined cost, and
(b) when each charging station operates independently without any coordination. The two related
solution concepts in these settings, C−Nash and Nash equilibrium respectively, are our main ob-
jects of study. We characterize them analytically in Theorem 4.1 and Corollary 4.5 respectively. In
general, we observe that the equilibrium decomposes into two components: a charging profile uni-
formly distributed across time and a correction term to account for the coalition between charging
stations (Theorem 4.1).
Next, we assess the outcomes under the Nash equilibrium and C−Nash equilibrium from three
3perspectives: (i) the societal perspective, considering the overall cost experienced by all charging
stations; (ii) the coalition’s perspective, focusing on all charging stations operated by an EVCC;
and (iii) the perspective of charging stations not in the coalition. Under some specific parameter
settings, we provide conditions under which the formation of a coalition is better than the indepen-
dent operation of charging stations in Theorem 4.7 and 4.11. Additionally, we corroborate these
theoretical findings by presenting numerical instances when these conditions are satisfied.
Finally, we demonstrate several instances of problem specific parameters like the size of the
coalition and composition of the coalition (in terms of demand and sensitivity of stations), which
show that coordination may lead to undesirable outcomes to society, coalition and non-coalitional
stations. These example highlight instances where the intuition about coordinating charging sta-
tions fails.
2 Related Works
In this section, we review several related line of works.
Aggregative games and EV charging. Several works have proposed EV charging as a
non-cooperative game (Deori et al., 2017; Gan et al., 2012; Ma et al., 2011; Paccagnan et al.,
2018). These works mainly study existence, uniqueness, and computation of Nash equilibria of the
EV charging game, and analyze these equilibria via measures such as the price of anarchy (PoA)
(Paccagnan et al., 2018). Our key differentiation from this line of literature is to understand the
impact of the formation of a coalition of a subset of EV stations.
Coalitions and equilibria. Equilibriumcharacterizationundercoalitionshasbeenstudiedvia

can collectively deviate from their strategy to improve their utilities, and was first introduced as a
concept in (Aumann, 1959). Since this seminal paper, numerous studies have delved into necessary
and sufficient conditions for its existence (Nessah and Tian, 2014) and computational properties
(Gatti et al., 2017). Recently, there is an emerging interest in characterizing the performance of
such equilibria in terms of price of anarchy (Andelman et al., 2009; Bachrach et al., 2014; Chien
and Sinclair, 2009; Epstein et al., 2007; Feldman and Friedler, 2015; Ferguson et al., 2023), which

to the concept of strong Nash equilibrium, which serves as a refinement of Nash equilibrium, our
C−Nash equilibrium (Definition 3.3) represents a relaxation of the traditional Nash equilibrium.

but rather to explore and comprehend the implications of naturally occurring coalitions within
energy markets.
Users as price-takers. Several studies have delved into the potential detrimental effects of
uncoordinated Electric Vehicle (EV) charging on the power grid (Gruosso, 2016; Quiros-Tortos
et al., 2018). In response, efforts such as those outlined in (Alexeenko and Bitar, 2023; Fu et al.,
2020; Obeid et al., 2023) have tackled the challenge of devising incentive mechanisms to coordinate
small users, often categorized as “price-takers,” to shift their charging windows and mitigate grid
impacts. However,incontrasttotheseapproaches,ourworkconceptualizeschargingstations,which
serve many EVs and thus can aggregate demand, as “price-makers” within electricity markets.
Coalitions in power systems. Coalitionsontheproductionsideofenergymarketshavebeen
studiedextensively(Baeyensetal.,2013;Banaeietal.,2016;BitarandPoolla,2012;Blumrosenand
Mizrahi,2023;delaNietaetal.,2014;Nayyaretal.,2013;Pinson,2013;Sharmaetal.,2014;Zhang
et al., 2015, 2018; Zhao et al., 2013). The main goal in this line of literature is to study the impact
of coalitions on uncertainty reduction, market power and bidding of renewable power producers.
However, our goal here is to study coalitions that could emerge on the demand side, specifically
between (heterogeneous) charging stations, and understand the impact of size and composition of
coalitions on the resulting equilibrium.

Charging stations as strategic entities. Consider a game consisting of N charging stations,
each operating as a strategic entity making decisions on their charging levels throughout a charging
periodspanningT unitsoftime. Eachstationi ∈ [N]ischaracterizedbyanominal charging profile
(x¯t) , where the total charge demanded is d . Mathematically, this means P x¯t = d , for
i t∈[T] i t∈[T] i i
every i ∈ [N]. The variation of charge demanded between stations reflect differences in the number
of vehicles typically utilizing each charging facility.
However, due to the presence of other stations in the grid, the actual charging profile of any
station may differ from the nominal charging profile. Formally, let xt be the charge demanded by
i
station i during step t. It must hold that for every i ∈ [N], P xt = d . Define X := {x ∈
t∈[T] i i i i
RT : P xt = d } to be the set of feasible charging profiles for station i 1. With a slight abuse
t∈[T] i i
of notation, we define xt ∈ RN as the vector of charging profiles of all stations at time step t ∈ [T].
Additionally, we define x = (xt) to be the joint charging profile of all of stations. We

define the set of all joint charging profile of all charging stations to be X := Q X .

We model the electricity prices to be reactive, i.e. the price of electricity depends on the total
charge demanded. More formally, the cost of incurred by any station i ∈ [N] under a joint strategy
x ∈ X is represented as:
c (x) := X pt(x)xt+ µ i ∥x −x¯ ∥2, (1)

where (a) µ > 0 is the sensitivity parameter of station i ∈ [N]; (b) for every t ∈ [T], pt(x) denotes

the price per unit of electricity when the joint charging profile of all stations is x. Using the
aggregative game framework (Deori et al., 2017; Gan et al., 2012; Ma et al., 2011; Paccagnan et al.,
2018), we consider pt(x) := at+bt1⊤xt for some at,bt > 0. The parameters at represent the price
N
fluctuations due to non-EV demand on the grid, and the parameters bt represent the marginal cost
of electricity for additional unit of production. In this paper, we assume that for all time t ∈ [T],
bt = b for some positive scalar b ∈ R .

as needed (Khan et al., 2019). It is an interesting direction of future research to impose additional operational con-
straints on the set X which align more closely with real-world conditions. Our main goal is to initiate the study of
the impact of coalitions on the equilibrium outcome of interaction between EV charging stations.
6Remark 3.1. The heterogeneity in sensitivity parameters µ between different stations can be
i
ascribed to the geographic location in which they are situated (cf. Figure 1). For instance, a station
positioned in downtown might exhibit heightened sensitivity in meeting its demand requirements
compared to one situated within a residential neighborhood.
Nash equilibrium, defined below, is widely used to characterize the interaction in these kinds of
charging games (Deori et al., 2017; Gan et al., 2012; Ma et al., 2011; Paccagnan et al., 2018).

74 Results
In Section 4.1, we undertake an analytical characterization of the C−Nash equilibrium with respect
to the game parameters. Subsequently, in Section 4.2, we establish conditions on these parameters,
elucidating scenarios where the traditional Nash equilibrium surpasses the C−Nash equilibrium in
terms of overall cost experienced by all charging stations, by charging stations within the coali-
tion, and by charging stations outside the coalition. Finally, in Section 4.3, we provide numerical
examples that exemplify the conditions delineated in Section 4.2.
4.1 Analytical Characterization of C−Nash equilibrium
Theorem 4.1. For any arbitrary coalition C ⊂ [N], when b > 0 and µ > 0 ∀i ∈ N, the C−Nash

equilibrium exists, is unique, and takes the following form

the concatenated vector of charging profiles x† := [x1†,··· ,x1†,······ ,xT†,··· ,xT†]⊤.

First, we show that for any coalition C ⊂ [N], the resulting game is a strongly monotone game.
Toensurethisit issufficienttoverifythat(i)thestrategy setisconvex, and(ii)thegame Jacobian
is positive definite (Facchinei and Pang, 2003). The convexity of strategy sets holds because the
strategy sets X are simplices. Next, to compute the game Jacobian, we define

It can be verified that the game Jacobian, ∇G(x) = Θ := I ⊗ b(1 1⊤ +C)+µ , is a positive

definite matrix (cf. Lemma 4.2). Thus, for any C, the game is strongly monotone, and there exists
8a unique equilibrium.

By definition of C−Nash equilibrium, charging stations within C jointly solve the optimization
problem P (x† ) when the charging profiles of other stations x† is known. Similarly, each player
C −C −C
i ∈ [N]\C solves the optimization problem P (x† ) when the charging profile of other players

x† is known. Note that each of the optimization problems has linear constraints, and hence
−i
the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) conditions are necessary for optimality. We solve the KKT
conditions of all these problems simultaneously to get a unique solution. Since we established that
the equilibrium is unique, this unique solution to the KKT conditions is the C−Nash equilibrium.
The KKT conditions can be written in a compact form as in (3), where λ = (λ ) is the
i i∈[N]
vector of Lagrange multipliers associated with the linear constraint of every charging station.

this fact and solving (3) by eliminating λ, we obtain a closed-form expression for the C−Nash
equilibrium in (4).

Expanding the terms using the time index, it can be checked that equation (4) is equivalent to
(3a), completing the proof.
Next, we present a technical result, used in proof of Theorem 4.1, the proof of which is deferred
9to Appendix A.1.
Lemma 4.2. Θ and Γ are positive definite and hence invertible matrices.
We now make some remarks about Theorem 4.1.
Remark 4.3. The closed-form equilibrium solution in (3a) is comprised of a fixed term and a
correction term. The fixed term represents a charging profile that is uniform across time. The
second term is the correction to account for the aggregate effects of the coalition, demand and
charging preferences of the charging stations, and exogenous non-EV demand. As expected, when
the time-dependent factors at′ and x¯t′ are constant across time, the correction term is zero and
charging stations charge uniformly across time.

104.2 When is C−Nash equilibrium beneficial?
In this subsection, we study conditions under which C−Nash equilibrium will be preferred over
Nash equilibrium and vice-versa. For a charging profile x, define the total cost incurred by a group
of charging stations in S ⊆ [N] as
X
c (x) := c (x), ∀ x ∈ X. (5)
S i
i∈S
In order to compare the outcome under Nash equilibrium and C−Nash equilibrium, we use the
following metrics:
c (x∗) c (x∗) c (x∗)
[N] C [N]\C
M := , M := , M := . (Eval-Metric)
[N] c (x†) C c (x†) [N]\C c (x†)
[N] C [N]\C
For any S ∈ {[N],C,[N]\C}, if M < 1 then Nash equilibrium is preferred, otherwise C−Nash
S
equilibrium is preferred3 by the coalition S. Next, we theoretically characterize these metrics in
two cases:
4.2.1 Case A: Exogeneous price fluctuations at are uniform across time
Here, weassumethatthereexistssomea ∈ R suchthatat = a,foreveryt ∈ [T]. Thiscanhappen
+
when the price is influenced by a constant non-EV demand throughout the day. Under this setting,
the equilibria x† and x∗ are represented below.
Proposition 4.6. Suppose at = at′ for all t,t′ ∈ [T]. Then for every t ∈ [T],

Further, consider the scenario when all the charging stations prepare for similar peak and low
demand hours, and use charging rate recommendations from EV manufacturers to predict their
demand requirements. That is, they desire similar demand profiles (up to a constant factor) across
the day. This scenario is captured in Assumption 4.1.
Assumption 4.1. The desired demand of each charging station i ∈ [N] at time step t ∈ [T] is

4.3 C-Nash equilibrium may not always be beneficial
In this subsection, using the setup from Section 4.2, we construct instances4 that may not be
conducive to the formation of a coalition. These cases demonstrate that coalitions between a

subset of charging stations may not always be beneficial, and that the composition of the coalition
needs to be considered carefully.
We set N = 5, T = 10, b = 0.5, and consider that each station can be of two types: Type H
or Type L. For the purpose of this example, we consider that all stations in a coalition will be of
Type L and all stations outside the coalition are of Type H. A station i ∈ [N] is said to be Type H
if d = 5 and µ = 1, and of Type L if d = 1 and µ = 0.1. Additionally, we set αt = η for t ≤ T/2,
i i i i 1
and η otherwise. Furthermore, we set a = 0.5+δν where ν ∼ Unif([0,1]). We study the impact

of the size of the coalition on various metrics presented in (Eval-Metric).
In Figure 2, we study the setting of η = 0.4/T,η = 1.6/T and δ = 0, which is aligned with the

also provides an advantage to stations outside coalitions, which might not be preferred by EVCCs
that operates the coalition.

5 Discussion
In this section we expand on the experimental insights obtained in Section 4.3 by discussing the
effects of the following two kinds of variations in the parameters5:
Impact of non-uniform variations in both at and αt. In Figure 4, we study the impact of
the size of the coalition in terms of (Eval-Metric). In contrast to Section 4.3, we consider both at
and αt to be non-uniform and randomly assign a station to be Type H with probability 0.2 if they
are within the coalition. All stations outside of coalition are assigned to be Type L. We find that
if the size of coalition is small then Nash equilibrium is favorable along all metrics. However, as
the size of coalition increases, it may be beneficial to form a coalition. This example demonstrates
that whether a coalition is beneficial or not may depend on the size of the coalition being formed.
Essentially, in this example, the coalition is able to profit off of ‘economies of scale’ that were not
present when the coalition size is small (which is controlled by the probability of a Type H station
being in the coalition).

16Impact of the composition of the coalition. Here, we show that whether or not a coalition is
beneficial not only depends on the size, but also the composition of the coalition. To illustrate this
point, we examine an example with N = 3, T = 10, b = 1 and at = 10 for all t ∈ [T]. We posit a
scenariowherethefirsttwostationsformacoalition. Eachstationisoneoftwotypes, namely Type
H or Type L. We call a station i ∈ [N] to be of Type H if d = 5 and µ = 5, and of Type L if d = 1
i i i
and µ = 1. In Figure 5, we present a comparative analysis, evaluating how different coalitions
i
perform in terms of metric presented in (Eval-Metric). We find under some circumstances M > 1
S
for all S ∈ {[N],C,[N]\[C]} indicating that such coalitions would not form. For instance, this is the
case when the coalition is comprised of atleast one Type H station and the station outside coalition
is of Type H. On the contrary, perhaps surprisingly, there are also instances when M < 1 for all
S
S ∈ {[N],C,[N]\[C]}. For instance, this is the case when the stations within a coalition are of Type
H and the station outside the coalition is of Type L. This indicates that the heterogeneity between
the types of stations that constitute the coalition plays a significant role in whether or not the
coalition is beneficial, and opens avenues for further research.
6 Conclusion
In this work, we initiate a study to understand the impact of coalitions that could emerge between
EV charging stations as charging infrastructure continues to grow in coming years. As charging
stations draw substantial amount of electricity from the grid, they can become “price-makers”
and influence the grid operation and electricity prices. More often than not, multiple charging
stations are operated by same electric vehicle charging company (EVCC), which could facilitate
coordination between charging stations. In this work, we analytically characterize the equilibrium
outcome in the presence of coalitions by modeling the interaction as a non-cooperative game. Our
analysis hints at potential losses encountered by EVCCs if they coordinate all charging stations
ownedbythem; sometimesitmaybebeneficialtoinsteadallowallchargingstationstodecidetheir
demand profile autonomously.
There are several interesting questions for future research in understanding the impact of coali-
tion between charging stations. In the current model we assume that the overall demand of a
charging station is fixed. More realistically, this demand could be decided via feedback from
electricity prices (Escudero-Garzas and Seco-Granados, 2012; Lee et al., 2014; Yuan et al., 2015).
Furthermore, there are additional operational constraints such as the limited capacity of the energy

between charging stations.

Note that Θ = I ⊗ b(1 1⊤ +C)+µ is positive definite if and only if each of the terms in

the Kronecker product is positive definite (Schacke, 2004). Hence, it is sufficient to show that
Q := b(1 1⊤ +C)+µ is a positive definite matrix. First, note that Q is a symmetric matrix.

For every t ∈ [T], define Gt := P at′ Tδtt′ −1 . Using this, the expression for x†t from
