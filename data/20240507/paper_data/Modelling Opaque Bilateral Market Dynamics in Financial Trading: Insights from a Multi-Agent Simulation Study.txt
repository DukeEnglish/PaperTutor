(OTC) trading, and commonly occurring between ”market makers”. The uniqueness of the bilateral
market, characterized by negotiated transactions and a limited number of agents, yields valuable insights
for agent-based modelling and quantitative finance. The inherent rigidity of this market structure, which
is at odds with the global proliferation of multilateral platforms and the decentralization of finance,
underscores the unique insights offered by our agent-based model. We explore the implications of market
rigidity on market structure and consider the element of stability, in market design. This extends the
ongoing discourse on complex financial trading environments, providing an enhanced understanding of
their dynamics and implications.

1 Introduction
We venture into the realm of applying agent-based modelling methods to the Australian government bond market.
Our approach employs single level multi-agent programming to simulate the behaviour of trading between banks,
also known as ”market makers”. This facet represents a centralization within the existing market structure. Unlike
equitymarkets,theAustraliangovernmentbondmarketdoesnotoperatethroughasingleregulatedtradingexchange.
Instead, clients aiming to transact government bonds must interact with market makers across numerous disjointed
trading platforms, electronic messaging services, and even directly with human traders via non-digital means such as
via telephone.
Contrary to stock markets, where prices are primarily driven by supply and demand, the prices in government
bond markets are significantly impacted by the respective countries’ central banks through their management of
interest rate policies and, more recently, inflation rate expectations. Although markets can price in the potential for
changes in interest rates, bond prices largely reflect the current rate-setting policy.
Market participants typically concentrate on facilitating bond sales and purchases, rather than the trading price
of the bond. This emphasis is partially explained by the contractual interest payments associated with bonds. By
owning a bond, the holder receives returns (interest payments), making the bond market unusual in that prices are
lesscriticalthanaccessto”flow”or”liquidity”. Ourworkprimarilyfocusesonmodellingthis”flow”orthemovement
of bonds through the market.
Additionally, bond markets have a number of features which are not relevant for our modeling purpose but are
worth highlighting. The price of a bond is inversely related to the yield that the current market expects. As part of a
governments bond issuance program, the mechanism through which they borrow funds, a number of bonds will be

design concept of liquidity transfer and government bonds are largely substitute for different maturities. In Australia
this is typically the 5 year bond.
Considering the few market makers (four) compared to the vast number of bond buyers and sellers (potentially
over 2000), alongside the lack of direct observability of markets and agents, calibrating parameters of an agent-based
model becomes complex. Despite no consensus method for this [7], we propose an inductive approach using market

implications for the future regulation of this marketplace.
We simulate heterogeneous market makers trading a single type of product: a 5-year Australian government bond
1. Each market maker is modelled as an individual agent with its own adaptive utility function. Agents acquire bonds
from their unique, non-overlapping client base, as characterised by the Australian Office of Financial Management
(AOFM). This client base includes various sectors, such as Interbank, Bank balance sheet, other domestic, Japan,
Asia (excluding Japan), UK, Europe, Americas, and other international. Since the initiation of data release in 2016,
Interbank has consistently represented the single largest share of secondary market turnover, averaging 26% of all
reported volumes as trades between themselves.
2 Background: Bond Markets and Agents
Global bond markets encompass diverse participant types or agents. In Australia, these include major retail banks
acting as trading facilitators (market makers), superannuation funds as typical debt purchasers, and hedge funds or
other trading houses functioning as clients. Beyond participants, several markets or platforms host bond trading,
analogous to a stock exchange but for bonds. Notably, Australia lacks a dominant trading venue, resulting in a highly
fragmented bond market dispersed across numerous private software platforms. This landscape contrasts starkly
with equity markets that have a unified trading mechanism under a single regulatory authority. The bond markets,
conversely, are opaque and decentralised.
Following the COVID-19 pandemic, the Australian Federal Government augmented its borrowing to fuel a variety
of social initiatives and direct economic support measures. As of April 30, 2023, the Commonwealth of Australia’s
gross debt on issuance stands at $894 billion, with $300 billion held by the Reserve Bank due to quantitative easing 2.
The Australian Office of Financial Management (AOFM) 3 collates and releases only high-level macro trading data,
reporting that domestic market makers conducted 28% of all bond trading transactions in 2022. Additionally, the
Australian Securities and Investments Commission oversees the licensing of exchange mechanisms and regulates the
behaviour across these platforms 4.
In our quest for viable modelling approaches and AI-based techniques, it became evident that the complexity of
the bond market necessitates a method capable of modelling nonlinear dynamics with limited data. Notably, intricate
interactions characterize this dynamic system, and these cannot be simplified readily. We delve into a historical
overview of the explored techniques and approaches to address this challenge. Bond market design research remains a
nascentfield,withmuchofthefocusplacedonbondpricingmodelsandinferringdefaultprobabilitiesratherthanthe
market’s design and structure. A significant portion of bonds continues to be traded ”over-the-counter”. As global
markets transition to electronic trading, the resultant transparency begins to resonate with areas of interest in [6].
Regulatory demands for increased transparency [6], along with growing concerns about bond market structures [45],
have invoked considerations of regulatory changes’ potential impacts on future market designs [13]. The ongoing
market evolution, however, seems hindered by data scarcity, inadvertently impeding academic literature in this realm
(see [4]).

2May 2023, significant industry consolidation was announced. TradeWeb acquired Yeildbroker 5, which dominates the
Australian bond market, while ICAP purchased LiquidNet. Additionally, Bloomberg, TradeWeb, and MarketAxess
launched a joint venture centralizing bond market transaction data collection 6. This reshuffling, driven partly by
regulatory demands for transaction visibility, prompts our work to offer a fresh modeling approach to the evolving
market microstructure.
2.2 Previous work on Market mechanisms
Mechanism design, a subset of Game theory, is often employed to analyze decentralized systems and their attributes.
Such research is often ”used as a tool to analyze decentralised systems and their properties” [42]. It explores the
creation of mechanisms that implement a social choice function, considering rational participant behavior. With
advancements, it’s now possible to approximate sub-optimal algorithmic design principles. Further work by [22], [36],
[51], [23], [50] and [18] also covers this. However, these markets fundamentally differ from the bond market we look to
model. Bond markets aren’t composed solely of price-taking agents, and there’s no evidence suggesting a shift in
demand for collaborative purposes.
2.3 Agent-Based Models
Agent-basedmodeling(ABM),employingcomputationalmethodstodepictvariousagents’interactions,isaptlysuited
to elucidating bond market dynamics. This approach’s strength lies in simulating scenarios involving interdependent
and adaptive agents, facilitating the reproduction of complex dynamic systems [9, 28]. Further exploration into
ABM is detailed in [26, 41, 58]. We aim to extend this field by applying ABM to a partly decentralized marketplace
characterized by abundant goods sources and relatively few agents, integrating the theory of Adaptive Market
Hypothesis (AMH) introduced in [39]. AMH investigates the interaction between market participant behaviour and
design features [39], aligning well with ABM analysis.
2.3.1 MESA and SugarScape: ABM for Complex Dynamic Systems
SugarScape signifies the application of ABM to the growth of artificial complex societies, pioneered by [25]. This
simulation mirrors a society where agents and their environment interact following a set of rules. The model starts
with few rules applied to specific agents, then evolves to examine the resulting marketplace. It features various
extensions like agents’ coalition formation, meta structures, and trading 7. Notable iterations of the [25] framework
and its MESA extension are examined in [47, 43, 46, 32].
2.4 Agent-Based Models Employing Reinforcement Learning
Recent advancements in reinforcementf learning have incorporated agent models for training [57]. This approach
largely reduces market participants into two categories concerning liquidity provision—either providers or consumers.
Echoing the work by [17], the authors propose a game-theoretic approach employing two agent categories to model all
participants’ utility function. The model shows potential in deducing latent behaviours and utility functions of the
two agent types by repeatedly playing ”games” using market data.
Our work, representing bond market trading banks, demonstrates a preference for agents to avoid inter-trading to
clear inventory, typically driven by an asset imbalance influenced by client demand. This utility function significantly
differs from the binary categorization of agents into either liquidity providers or consumers (see appendix).
As previously discussed, no consensus exists on the best method to calibrate an ABM [7]. The complexity of
environments we aim to model often precludes the observation of agents’ utility functions, policies, or response
functions [14]. Machine learning has been applied to estimate the weights, calibrations, policies, and other factors
within an ABM across diverse economic or social systems [5]. In the finance domain, this has proven successful in the
foreignexchangetradingmarket, wheremodelsrelyonfindingcalibrationsetsthroughreinforcementlearning[27,57].
However, these market domains substantially differ from the bilateral bond market we aim to model. This existing
body of work often benefits from features absent in our target market, including the reduction of agents into only two
classes, homogeneous in utility function and form, and mutually exclusive (Liquidity Providers or Liquidity Takers, as
defined in [57]). Additionally, previous work depends on either a highly observable market environment or a unique
environment description due to regulatory requirements or other functions [10, 11, 21]. Employing machine learning
techniques (such as reinforcement learning), researchers create a ”surrogate” model. While surrogates can improve

3We contribute to this body of work by modelling a less advanced yet more challenging market dynamic, exploring
an inductive approach to calibration.
2.5 Bond market research
Bonds literature predominantly centers around pricing products [40],[24], [12], [44], [37] and advanced alternative
pricing methods [3, 1, 2]. Limited studies have explored bond market design, often veering towards related markets
like corporate bonds [16] or bond futures [59]. Notably, the work of the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission [20]
and Lin et al. [38] applying agent-based modeling to equity markets and corporate bond markets respectively, aligns
with our research. We aim to extend these methodologies to the Australian bond market’s unique dynamics. The
universally applicable agent-based modelling approach, evidenced by [35, 26, 41, 58], is utilized in our work for a
specific application. This allows us to explore market topology [55], [15] and dynamics [16], [38], [19], [29], [52] within
the context of the Australian government bond trades regulation.
2.6 Validation of ABM’s
Agent-based models (ABMs) lack a universally agreed-upon calibration approach, prompting us to seek similarities
with ABM research in other technical sectors, including applied system dynamic theory and social constructed mental
models. The ”element distance ratio” is utilized to measure distance between two model structures, assessing each
model’s credibility. This concept has been applied to ABMs in previous research, comparing an inductively calibrated
ABM to a deductively calibrated one.
Inourresearch,whichinvolvesinductivelycalibratedABMs,weresorttosensitivityanalysisforconceptualmodel
validation. Thevalidationmethodofcomparingthesameinputdataintwodifferentlycalibratedmodelsandassessing
the distance ratio is employed, with a smaller ratio indicating closer model alignment. Extensive discussions around
the challenges of such methods exits in [53]
We also consider the five ”value-based” validation criteria derived from systems design work, which entail expert
consultation on five validity points. However, in a market where participants are bound by non-disclosure agreements,
such consultations involving subjective judgments may not be fully applicable. Recognising the importance in user
trust, explainable systems work exists though presents more challenges than solutions [54]
Surrogate models—low-dimension models with fewer parameters—are examined as a recent advancement in the
field. Heterogeneousagent-basedmodels(HAMs),asexplainedintheresearch,areabletoeffectivelyreplicatefinancial
dataseries’stylizedfacts. Thesemodelsalsodemonstratetheircapabilityinexplainingmarketanomalieslikebubbles,
crashes, and sources of market ”chaos”. However, surrogate models tend to be built on markets that adhere more
to normality or distributional assumptions and are often trained via multiple simulated games based on simulated
market pricing.
It’s important to note the reliance of these methods on large training data sets, and the lack of a definitive way
to ascertain if a data set is sufficiently large or comprehensive for robustness. While much of the research focuses
on asset pricing with HAMs, our work applies these techniques to the market’s underlying structure. Unfortunately,
these HAM-based techniques aren’t applicable in our case, leading us to depend on sensitive analysis and matching
historical data, all while adhering to regulatory requirements.
3 Method
The proposed inductive approach utilizes market structure data from the Australian Government’s Office of Financial
Management and survey results for agent calibration. See appendix for specific model calibration is details. The
simulation incorporates utility functions and policies sourced from finance literature and regulatory mandates. We
utilise the power and complexity of the Sugarscape model as its naturally holds many similarities to the human
interaction methods of a bilateral market. For more detail on the design of Sugarscape see [25] and [8] .
3.1 Agent Interaction and Trading Mechanism
The model investigates the dynamic interaction of agents, trading bilaterally. The bilateral trading mechanism is
medium-agnostic, implying trades can occur through various channels. This model extends the framework of Axtell
and Epstein, applying the features of the market maker dynamic to the Sugarscape formalism. The synergies between
these frameworks manifest as follows:
1. Bond collection by agents from clients is labelled ”collecting,” similar to the term used in [25].
2. Market makers need bonds for funding purposes, analogous to [25]’s concept of ”metabolism”.
43. Each agent has a different and overlapping client base, akin to ”vision”.
4. By employing ”metabolism”, agents can quantify their bond accumulation desire, called the ”marginal rate of
substitution”.
5. The ”marginal rate of substitution” is a metric derived from each agent’s ability to acquire bonds and cash,
balanced against their internalized asset usage.
6. Trading periods are standardized as t∈I[0,t].

3.2 Market Characteristics
The proposed agent-based model represents the current trading environment with the following features:
1. Agents: ”Market makers,” majorly from the four Australian retail banks, collect assets from clients and trade
with other market makers as a ”last resort”.
2. Environment: The origin of Agents, also determining the client flow and inventory.
3. Market Rules: The strategies agents use for interaction, though not always government regulated.
3.3 Agent and Landscape Characteristics
Agents,whoarebuyers,sellers,ortraders,possessinherentneeds. Theylocateresources,transactwithothersintheir
”vision,” and can be removed after fulfilling their resource objectives. The marketplace, populated with resources held
by clients, offers agents the following actions:
1. Collect resources
2. Consume resources
3. Cease business operations
4. Trade with other agents if a utility valuation difference exists
A crucial marketplace feature is ”vision,” which details an agent’s access to client resources. In the financial
industry, this is known as ”franchise value” or client relationship depth.
3.3.1 Policies
A simple policy set is calibrated for all agents, where the model design triggers a trade for a welfare-improving
function. The welfare function evolves over time as agents accumulate and use resources. This reflects actual trading
environments for government bonds, creating a wealth effect for older books. Different participants can trade with
other agents at various prices, with no clearing price established. The model assumes a ”welfare-improving” policy for
bilateral trade between agents, mimicking actual market operations.
54 Code Implementation
Leveraging the crucial role of heterogeneous agent beliefs in financial markets, as highlighted by [17], we employ
various open-source code bases for implementing a customized version of ”SugarScape” that simulates the regulated
market structure of bond markets. We assume a discrete time approach, with asynchronius agent actions. Notably,
[33] provides a comprehensive agent-based model framework established by Sugarscape and commercially developed
software. Our implementation leverages open-source code from [31], along with libraries from [34] and [48].
We employ the following steps(see appendix for further details)
1. Initiate the simulation with four agents (matching the number of Australian market making banks).
2. Endow agents with predefined characteristics:
• Vision, representing client coverage breadth
• Metabolism, indicating the agent’s ”carrying cost” or the cost to stay in business.
• Initial bond resources (akin to each trading firms intial daily position)
3. Assign each agent a randomly determined starting territory or client base at inception of every simulation.
4. Enable trades when there are differences in agent valuations, with clear buyer-seller distinctions.
5. Conduct each interaction simulation asynchronously over time steps or epochs
6. Retain the same genetic factors at the start of each simulation, irrespective of the number of runs.
7. Repeat each basic market design simulation up to 200 times
In simulating bond markets, we integrated sources like survey responses, regulatory authority documentation, and
internal resources. The concept of stability employed here is a system that:
1. Aligns with regulatory requirements and publicly reported micro-structures.
2. Produces similar outcomes with small changes in inputs.
3. Approximates trade between agents to reported data for the AOFM.
4. Possesses a stable agent count without substantial system collapse.
Maintainingmarketfunctionalitystabilityisnotonlyvitalforsocietalfunctionsbutisalsoessentialforregulatory
bodies. Balancing client service and inter-agent trade is fundamental to ensure the network’s viability. The primary
metric under focus in this work is the percentage of agent interactions that involved trading with other agents.
5 Hypothesis: Projected Outcomes with Emphasis on Market
Trading Stability
Following our comprehensive analysis, we hypothesize the emergence of four notable outcomes. These outcomes,
significantly influenced by the stability of market trading, are anticipated to carry considerable relevance not only for
regulatory bodies but also in shaping and upholding the principles of fair market practices in financial trading.
5.1 Hypothesis 1: Role of Agent Diversity Versus Number in Market Stability
Influence of homogeneous agents in system stability Our hypothesis suggests that merely increasing the
numberofagents,whilekeepingtheirfeatureshomogeneous,doesnotcontributetomarketstability. Theexamination
of systems with identical agent and landscape feature sets, varying only in the number of agents, indicates a strong
correlationbetweenhomogeneityandfragility. Systemswithhomogeneousagentfeaturesexhibitacceleratedinstability,
collapsing by the 25th time step, as seen in our simulations that were designed to run until the 4000th time step.
Implications in trading Consideringthesparsedatapointsavailablefromthereal-worldopaquemarketplace,we
observedtheturnoverofbondsbetweendiverseclientsintheAustralianbondmarketandthenumberofmarket-making
banks(representedasagentsinourmodel). Thedataindicatesthatapproximately28%ofallturnoveroccursbetween
market-making banks (”agents”), while the remaining takes place between clients and agents in the environment.
We further expanded our analysis by conducting additional tests and simulations. Different epochs with varying
numbers of agents were simulated, attributing a range of outcomes to the distinct feature sets (such as metabolism,
vision, etc). Our hypothesis underlines the essential role of agent diversity, rather than sheer numbers, in promoting
the stability of market trading.
6Figure 2: Impact of Homogeneity: System instability observed in populations with identical agent features
1. A simple test of lowly diverse agents (4) with vision and metabolism ranging between 1-5 units, trades occur
less than 1% of the time. Broadening out vision (1-20 units) and metabolism to range between 1- 20, but still
lookingat4agents,tradingoccursin3.4%ofactions,whilstkeepingmetabolismlowerat1-5units,butallowing
vision to range up to 20 units produces trading of 9.2% of interactions
2. Increasing agents to 16 (the current number in the UK markets) again with vision and metabolism ranging
between 1-5, trades occur 6.418% of the time
3. Increasing agents further to 100 (the approximate number of the US market) with vision and metabolism
ranging between 1 -20 for each field, 38.2% of actions resulted in trades
Summarizing the findings, it can be deduced that increasing agent diversity tends to augment trading frequencies,
particularlywhenagentpopulationsremainrelativelylow. Thus,ourfirsthypothesissupportsthenotionthatdiversity
of agents plays a more crucial role in trading dynamics and market stability than simply the number of agents.
5.2 Hypothesis 2: Easing Trading Restrictions and Reducing Agent Costs
Enhances Trading Stability and Market Longevity
An exploration of systems comprised of a small agent population, i.e., four agents, with a moderate vision range
(1-10 units) but exceptionally low metabolism, yields notable results in terms of trading data. In this setup, trading
activities represent approximately 9.97% of all agent actions, marking a steady increase from the results obtained in
prior analyses for 4-agent systems.
A key mechanism for imposing trade restrictions or creating barriers is the introduction of a ’metabolism’ penalty
function for agents. Each time step or turn in a simulation penalizes an agent by deducting a fixed amount from their
accrued resource values, akin to their metabolism. In extreme instances, it is possible to evaluate the stability of a
dynamiccomplexsystembyallowingeachclientresourceareatoregrow,essentiallyenablingresourceregenerationand
the potential for endless interactions due to the perpetual regrowth of resources. With low metabolism, a continuous
supply of resources, and a wide vision, trading activities occur remarkably 38.7% of the time between the four agents
in this non-realistic edge case.
This outcome subtly suggests the counter-intuitive hypothesis that regulators might facilitate a more stable and
liquid market by reducing trading barriers for agents. Easing restrictions, lowering costs, and ensuring a continuous
supply of resources could potentially encourage more frequent interactions, thereby fostering market stability and
longevity.
7Figure 3: Trading propensity with systems of 4 agents with increasing degrees of freedom
5.3 Hypothesis 3: Broadening Client Base Does Not Necessarily Enhance Agent
Welfare
The intricate dynamics between agents, their feature sets, and the environment can be explored by considering
an agent’s ’vision’ as a proxy for the breadth of their client base, while holding all other variables constant. This
is pertinent to financial markets, where banks and financial institutions often aim for economies of scale, and the
emergence of ”fintech disrupters” introduces a wider mix of agents with diverse client bases. Furthermore, regulatory
strategiesthatpromotecompetitionoftenencouragetheentryofsmaller,newermarketplayers,whichinherentlyhave
a narrower client base compared to established participants. These scenarios can be evaluated by investigating the
impact of an agent’s ’vision’ on various agent designs.
Fromtheanalyses, itisevidentthatforsystemswithsmallagentpopulations, expandingthebreadthoftheclient
baseorincreasing’vision’isnotauniversalremedyforenhancingstability,trading,orlongevity. Instead,theseresults
appear to be more influenced by the agents’ ’metabolism,’ or essentially, the barriers to entry and sustaining an agent
in the field.
In the context of financial markets, this is a crucial finding. Specifically, adding an agent with limited ’vision’ can
still lead to successful outcomes provided the agent possesses the right supportive features. However, such success
scenarios aren’t common. In most simulations, agents with broader ’vision’ or a larger client base seem to have an
’easier’ time trading with others. Interestingly, these effects can reverse if higher agent costs are introduced.
This suggests a nonlinear relationship between trading barriers (represented by increasing metabolism or agent
costs)andclientbaseexpansion. Whilereducingagentcostsdirectlyimprovesagentwelfare(measuredasthenumber
of trades and time to cessation), expanding client bases usually enhances welfare, but not when costs also increase.
Hence, broadening the client base does not inherently guarantee improved agent welfare.
5.4 Hypothesis 4: Is the current Market configuration the Goldilocks version?
Ourstudysuccessfullyparallelsanagent-basedmodel(ABM)withthecurrentlyobservedattributesoftheAustralian
bond markets across 100 epochs, providing insights into optimal market structures. We primarily leveraged data from
theAustralianOfficeofFinancialManagement(AOFM),whichreportedinterbanktradingbondsturnoveraccounting
for 28% of traded volumes. We test the hypothesis that the current mechanism supports the ”Goldilocks” market
design, i.e. that the market design is not too rigidity or fragile, and has just enough diversity for agent behaviour.
We simulated epochs with four agents and a vast client base, represented by a vision of 50 units. This value
8Figure 4: Agents with higher vision trade more, and with other agents of higher vision
signifies the ecosystem’s maximum view from any point considering the Moore method’s application over the Von
Neumann method. These simulations revealed an average trading occurrence of 29.1% of interactions, implying that
agents possess overlapping client bases and complete vision of the entire environment. It’s worth noting that these
findings are premised on comparing AOFM’s reported trading volumes with our model’s trading frequency. Although
it’s not an exact match, it serves as a reasonable proxy in such an opaque market.
In addition, our results demonstrate that the median frequency of trading within an average simulation stands at
23.7% of actions, highlighting considerable variance and distribution in outcomes. Nevertheless, the range of trading
interactions is broad, with some four-agent simulations documenting trades as low as 2% of the time, while others
peak at 94%. Even though averages may be skewed, the distribution reveals significant variability, further supporting
the non-linear dynamics in agent interactions.
Overall,ourfindingsprovideevidencetowardsa’Goldilocks’scenario—suggestingthattheoptimalmarketstructure
might be one that closely aligns with the current configuration of the Australian bond market.
5.5 Summary
This study presents four significant hypotheses concerning the characteristics of agent behavior, their influence on
trading stability, and their role in shaping the overall structure of the financial markets, specifically focusing on the
Australian bond market.
The firsthypothesis illustrates therelationship betweenagent diversity and trading frequency, finding that greater
diversity among agents leads to an increased rate of trades, suggesting that agent homogeneity, as opposed to sheer
numbers, has a more considerable impact on the frequency of trades.
The second hypothesis examines the effects of reduced trading restrictions and agent costs on the market. It
implies that these reductions could promote both trading stability and longevity. In a seemingly counterintuitive
finding,itsuggeststhatbyeasingconstraintsonagents,marketregulatorscouldpotentiallyencourageamoreresilient
and liquid market.
The third hypothesis questions the assumption that a broader client base necessarily benefits the agent. It
contendsthatinthecomplexinterplayofagentcharacteristicsanddynamics,suchfactorsasbarrierstoentryandthe
maintenance costs associated with market presence can significantly influence outcomes, rather than the breadth of
the client base alone.
The fourth and final hypothesis, often referred to as the ”Goldilocks” hypothesis, aligns the agent-based model
with the existing characteristics of the Australian bond market. It underscores that trading interactions exhibit
9considerable variation, echoing the chaotic nature of real-world markets. This observation is supported by existing
literature on market behavior. On average, the trading frequency in the model aligns closely with reported trading
volumes, which serves as a reasonable approximation for such an opaque market. There is a need for further research
to ascertain whether these factors contribute to the market ”chaos” documented in literature [17] and [30].
This complexity and chaotic variation underscore the intricate interplay between agent costs, the breadth of client
bases, and their combined effects on market stability and agent welfare.
6 Conclusion
Thisresearcheffectivelyleveragesagent-basedmodelingtodepictthedynamicsoftheAustralianbondmarket,focusing
on market makers. Our model, informed by government data, encapsulates four agents, aligning with macro-level
bond turnover data from the Australian Office of Financial Management. Through a sensitivity analysis, we studied
the impacts of the number of agents, breadth of client base, and costs on market dynamics. Key insights include the
benefits of agent diversity for market stability and the surprising enhancement of stability through lowered agent
costs. Moreover, we found that a wide client base doesn’t necessarily secure an agent’s success. Even with identical
initial inputs mirroring the current macro-level market structure, the system can exhibit considerable variations in
stability, underscoring the chaotic nature of financial markets.
The implications for regulators are profound, offering a means to dissect the intricacies of financial markets
includingcentralization,clientnumberrules,regulatorycosts,anddailyvolatility. Themodelthusprovidesregulators
with a potent tool to better manage these factors in practical scenarios.

Appendix A Agent Vision
How actions occur are governed by code implementation details that align to assumptions both about the agents
themselves and the market landscape. One crucial feature is the concept of ”vision” - detailed above. This has the
effect of detailing how far an agent can access client sources of resources. In the financial industry this is considered a
key feature and referred to as the ”franchise value” or depth of client relationship/client base.
Vision v is the breadth of analysis each agent can perform and ranges up to 5 unit moves in any one direction.
This is fixed for the life of an agent within a simulation.
Appendix B Metabolism
Let Met ( , , ) be the initial metabolism for each. Metabolism is a metric of how much of a resource and agent

simulation. It can be thought of as the cost of capital financing that a market maker must pay internally, and or the
internal resources needed to sustain a market making seat.
12Appendix C Marginal rate of substitution: MRS
Within [25] p102 - the rate at which an agent has a preference for one commodity over another is determined by the
amount of each resource and the relative usage of that resource (ie ”metabolism”). The ratio of such preferences is
the MRS. Note that accumulation of each resource is incremented or decremented after each turn, but metabolism is
a constant throughout each simulation. Specifically this is;

Appendix D Welfare
An agent’s welfare function changes over time, aligning with live trading environments for government bonds. This
mechanismallowsforbondpositionaccumulation,similartoactualmarketdynamics,creatinglargeplayers(”whales”)
in the marketplace. Furthermore, the implementation permits participants to trade at different ”prices” with other
agents, eliminating the notion of a universal clearing price and promoting ”welfare-improving” bilateral trade. This
idea, welfare draws strongly from game theory and the ideas of what conditions must be met for game players to
interact. In this case, welfare is defined as some relative reference of one resource to another.
