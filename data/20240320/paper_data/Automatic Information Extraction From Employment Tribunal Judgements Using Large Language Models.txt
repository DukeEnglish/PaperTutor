Large Language Models

Abstract
Court transcripts and judgments are rich repositories of legal knowledge, detailing the
intricacies of cases and the rationale behind judicial decisions. The extraction of key
information from these documents provides a concise overview of a case, crucial for both legal
experts and the public. With the advent of large language models (LLMs), automatic
information extraction has become increasingly feasible and efficient. This paper presents a
comprehensive study on the application of GPT-4, a large language model, for automatic
information extraction from UK Employment Tribunal (UKET) cases. We meticulously
evaluated GPT-4’s performance in extracting critical information with a manual verification
process to ensure the accuracy and relevance of the extracted data. Our research is structured
around two primary extraction tasks: the first involves a general extraction of eight key aspects
that hold significance for both legal specialists and the general public, including the facts of
the case, the claims made, references to legal statutes, references to precedents, general case
outcomes and corresponding labels, detailed order and remedies and reasons for the decision.
The second task is more focused, aimed at analysing three of those extracted features, namely
facts, claims and outcomes, in order to facilitate the development of a tool capable of predicting
the outcome of employment law disputes. Through our analysis, we demonstrate that LLMs
like GPT-4 can obtain high accuracy in legal information extraction, highlighting the potential
of LLMs in revolutionising the way legal information is processed and utilised, offering
significant implications for legal research and practice.

11 Introduction
The advent of large language models (LLMs) has marked a significant milestone in the
evolution of artificial intelligence, extending its influence across various domains, including
the legal sector. These sophisticated models have redefined the possibilities within the realm
of legal artificial intelligence, offering innovative solutions to complex tasks that were
traditionally the preserve of human experts. The application of LLMs in legal contexts
promises to streamline operations, enhance accuracy and democratise access to legal
knowledge.
LLMs have been instrumental in performing a range of tasks within the legal domain, such as
contract analysis and case prediction (Jayakumar et al. 2023; Parizi et al. 2023; Bernsohn et al.
2024). One of the most promising applications of LLMs in law is automatic information
extraction from legal documents. This capability not only simplifies the process of analysing
vast quantities of legal texts but also paves the way for sophisticated downstream applications,
including predictive analytics and case summarisation.
The potential advantages of deploying LLMs for information extraction in legal contexts are
manifold. Primarily, these models offer cost efficiency by reducing the need for extensive
human labour in sifting through and interpreting complex legal documents. LLMs can process
and extract pertinent information from a large volume of cases at a pace unattainable by human
counterparts. However, the reliance on LLMs is not without its challenges. Concerns regarding
the accuracy of extracted information, potential biases and the models’ ability to navigate the
nuanced and context-dependent nature of legal language pose significant hurdles.
Given the burgeoning interest in the intersection of artificial intelligence and law, we have
chosen the United Kingdom Employment Tribunal (UKET) as our focal area of study. The
UKET presents a fertile ground for exploration due to its extensive repository of publicly
available judgments, which encapsulate a wide array of legal issues and decisions. By
harnessing the capabilities of GPT-4, one of the most advanced LLMs, we embarked on a
project to automatically extract critical information from a sample of UKET judgments.
Through precise prompt engineering and manual quality checks, we aimed to ensure the
reliability and relevance of our study on the extracted data.
Our research is structured around two principal extraction tasks. The first task involves a broad
extraction of eight key aspects that are of general importance to both legal experts and the lay
public, including: the facts of the case, the claims made by the parties, references to legal
statutes, references to precedents, general case outcomes, general case outcomes summarised
as one of four labels (namely “claimant wins”, “claimant partially wins”, “claimant loses” and
“other”), detailed order and remedies and, finally, reasons for the decision. The second task is
more focused, aimed at analysing three of those extracted features, namely the facts, claims
and general case outcomes (labelled), in order to facilitate the development of a tool capable
of predicting the outcome of employment law disputes.
The paper is structured as follows. First, we introduce the UKET system, highlighting the
simplicity of the judicial procedure and the clear structure of its judgments (section 2.1.). The
following subsection demonstrates the extent to which UKET judgments may be determined
by substantive and/or procedural factors, and introduces the concepts of procedural and
substantive predictability, as opposing perspectives which highly impact the dataset for
prediction models (section 2.2). Second, we provide a brief insight into how information
extraction and predictive systems have been employed in the legal industry, and into the initial
limitations of these systems, which have been increasingly surpassed as machine learning
2progresses. As many systems are provided by private companies, a public debate regarding
how LLM’s operate in the legal field is limited. Our paper aims to address this gap by openly
introducing the data and the design of an information extraction system for UKET judgments,
accompanied by a discussion of the prompt engineering developed which already sheds some
light onto limitations of legal extraction systems (section 4). That is, we identify some pitfalls
of the extraction system which were solved through better prompt engineering and disclose
some limitations which could not be addressed despite substantial prompt enhancing attempts.
Thereafter, we present the quality assessment which was used to verify the accuracy of the
outputs (the first part of the quality check), and to verify the relevance of the judgments for
prediction (the second part of the quality check) (section 5.1). The second part of the quality
check introduces the reader to a further discussion regarding the process of development of
predictive systems. It highlights that GPT-4, despite being able to accurately extract
information from case files, may not be able – in the absence of a carefully drafted predictive
prompt – to identify the judgments which allow for substantive predictability. Section 5.2.
quantitatively assesses the results produced by GPT-4 in our study and is followed by a
qualitative discussion which highlights the potential of GPT-4 and the limitations that it still
has for extraction of information (section 5.3). Finally, section 5.4, taking into consideration
how GPT-4 extracts and presents information, discusses whether it is feasible to develop a
predictive system based on GPT-4 extraction and, again, highlights some difficulties with this
approach.
This paper aims to contribute to the development of accurate and open systems, at the disposal
of the employers as well as the employees, reducing the current knowledge imbalance towards
the former, which may have easier access to these systems and the associated knowledge
(Adams et al. 2022).
The findings of our study are statistically robust, offering a representative snapshot of the
broader UKET database. By critically analysing the performance of GPT-4 in this legal
information extraction endeavour, we provide valuable insights into the strengths and
limitations of employing LLMs in the legal domain. Furthermore, our research highlights
various use cases for extracted information, underscoring its utility in enhancing legal research,
improving case management and informing judicial decision-making processes.
2 UKET and the English legal system
2.1 Fundamental features
In contrast with ordinary courts, which have a wider jurisdiction, the UK for centuries had a
number of courts that were local or that dealt with special matters, an example of which are the
employment tribunals (Spencer 1989). The UKET is part of the wider judicial system, and one
of the three largest tribunals in the greater tribunals system (Courts and Tribunals Judiciary
website: https://www.gov.uk/courts-tribunals/employment-tribunal). There are two separate
jurisdictions for Employment Tribunals in Great Britain: one for England and Wales, and one
for Scotland. Although they each have its own independent judiciary, they share the
Employment Tribunals Rules of Procedure 2013, hereinafter referred to as “Rules”.
The UKET aims to provide a procedure which is easily accessible, informal, speedy and
inexpensive (Harding et al. 2014). One way to achieve this is to require that almost all
proceedings are preceded by a conciliation attempt through the Advisory, Conciliation and
Arbitration Service (ACAS) (Rules, r. 18). If a conciliation is successful, the employment
dispute is not heard by the UKET. Other cases which are not heard by the tribunal are those
which are rejected after a preliminary consideration of the claim form and response (Rules, r.
326-28). As a result, UKET decisions do not represent the entirety of the employment dispute
outcomes.
Some judgments do not give reasons for the decision. Reasons for judgements may be given
orally at the hearing, in which case reasons will not be provided in writing, unless one of the
parties so requests within 14 days of the publication of the notice of the judgement (Rules, r.
62(3)). In such scenarios, it is difficult to identify whether the outcome is motivated by
procedural or substantive reasons without gathering further information on the specific case.
In contrast with other UK judgments, UKET decisions are clearly structured, not only because
there are no dissenting opinions, but also because there is a rule which defines which elements
a judgement must contain (Rules, r. 62(5)). Moreover, employment law provisions are often
more straightforward than, for example, legal questions decided by the Supreme Court. For this
reason, the decisions of the UKET seem to be clearer with a simpler structure compared with
the more complex decisions decided in the higher courts.
2.2 Relevance of procedure
Even when cases are heard by the UKET, a claim may still fail for procedural reasons. For
instance, the UKET may strike out all or part of a claim or response on any of the following
grounds: (a) scandalous or vexatious or has no reasonable prospect of success; (b) the manner
in which proceedings have been conducted by or on behalf of a party has been scandalous,
unreasonable or vexatious; (c) non-compliance with rules or orders of the tribunal; (d) not
having been actively pursued; (e) no longer possible to have a fair hearing (Rules, r. 37(1)).
Therefore, the fact that a claim has been struck out may be due to substantive issues that go to
the heart of the dispute (e.g., having no prospect of success), or to mere procedural issues (e.g.,
a party not having actively pursued a claim which is meritorious and which would otherwise
proceed).
This holds true more generally, as the general outcome of a judgement does not indicate simply
who is meritorious but may result from the procedural conduct of the parties. In other words,
one cannot deduct from the unsuccessful outcome of a case that the claim had no prospects of
success right from the outset. For example, if the claimant does not appear before the tribunal
and thereby fails to present the required evidence, the claim can be dismissed (Rules, r. 47).
The UKET may also dismiss the claim based on preliminary issues, e.g., if claim is not
presented on time, the tribunal is not well constituted or the claimant does not have the required
ACAS certificate. Furthermore, when no response has been timely presented, or when any
response received has been rejected and no application for a reconsideration is outstanding, or
where the respondent has stated that no part of the claim is contested, the tribunal can decide
the case on the available material without hearing the respondent (Rules, r. 21). Similarly, if
the respondent does not produce evidence (written or orally, by not attending the final hearing),
the claims may be found proven if the evidence is unchallenged.
Finally, claims may be withdrawn, for example because the parties reach a private settlement
or settle following conciliation by ACAS. Where a claim is withdrawn, the tribunal shall issue
a dismissal judgement (Rules, r. 52). Case management orders (e.g., admitting or excluding
witness evidence), which are not judgments, may incidentally be part of judgments (Mansfield
and Banerjee 2023).
Against this background, procedural issues are relevant because they may be the key reason
for a certain outcome. The outcome will depend not only on the facts and the points of law
under discussion, but also on the procedural conduct of the parties. Therefore, extracting
4procedural elements is required for a contextual understanding of the dispute. With this
information, one can identify the cases which were decided mainly for procedural reasons, for
the purpose of excluding them from the dataset or, contrarily, including them in a useful,
contextualised, way.
On the one hand, one may be interested in predicting the likelihood of success of a claim, taking
into consideration all procedural developments that may arise. Procedural issues reflect
significant obstacles faced by parties in submitting or defending a claim and might be relevant
for others who plan to make a procedural application, such as an extension of the time to submit
a claim or a response, and, therefore, are interested in considering certain procedural events.
Legislators and academics may welcome this approach, as it gives them the possibility of
continually monitoring, evaluating and reforming the tribunal system. The payment of tribunal
fees is a good example. Currently, the balance between the right to access the tribunals and
deterrence of vexatious claims has been established in the following way: claimants do not
need pay fees to submit an application, but the claimant may be required to pay a deposit and,
exceptionally, the tribunal can award costs against a claimant if it considers that the latter has
acted ‘vexatiously, abusively, disruptively or otherwise unreasonably’ (Deakin et al. 2021).
Additional measures could be implemented if, for example, a disproportionate number of
vexatious claims are being submitted. The Government could also increase the resources to
deal with claims that are burdening the system, or reform the law in areas which display
unfairly low levels of success. This approach is also useful for researchers interested in the
effective enforcement of employment rights. For such a study, the withdrawal or submission
out of time would count as "claimant loses", since, ultimately, the tribunal does not enforce the
right.
The Government publishes statistics on the percentages with which the following outcomes
have occurred: ACAS conciliated settlements, withdrawn, successful at hearing, unsuccessful
at hearing, struck out (not at hearing), default judgement and dismissed at a preliminary
hearing. However, these statistics are arranged on a yearly basis, are prone to inaccuracies and
do not give details of individual judgments or awards, which prevents more detailed content
analysis (Irving 2012).
On the other hand, lawyers may prefer to exclude procedure-based decisions from the dataset,
as they may not be interested in integrating procedural elements as inputs for a prediction task.
For example, lawyers may not be interested in assessing what happens if they withdraw the
claim, as they assume that the procedure is going to be well led by both parties. Instead, they
might wish to know the likelihood of succeeding, irrespective of procedural irregularities. From
such a perspective, decisions which are motivated by procedural reasons are anomalous and
they might be excluded from a prediction dataset. It is then possible to distinguish between
procedural predictability (based on a predictive system which includes procedure-based
decisions) and substantive predictability (based on a system which excludes procedure-based
decisions).
3 Information extraction for legal texts
Since the 1950s, legal scholars have been leveraging mathematical and computational tools to
analyse a wide range of legal domains. This effort involved using rule-based information
extraction methods and statistical extraction approaches. Researchers faced the challenge of
either selecting a detailed list of cases and patterns for rule-based analysis or defining a set of
features for a statistical system to consider. These features usually included legal and factual
criteria, as well as demographic information about the parties involved and the names of the
judges (Ashley and Bruninghaus 2006). In relation to employment law, as early as 1965,
5Grunbaum and Newhouse (1965) analysed 20 judgments of the US Supreme Court to identify
the variables which impacted the outcomes. Similarly, Field and Holley (1982) identified
factors which influenced the outcomes of performance appraisal judgments. The authors
independently selected the variables, identified the scoring codes for each variable selected and
classified each case according to a scoring scheme. Brudney et al. (2000) analysed the extent
to which extradoctrinal factors such as political party, gender and professional experience
influenced outcomes. Moreover, several studies have been concluded to establish correlations
between specific demographic groups and the ability to pursue their employment rights in
tribunals. In the US, Schuster and Miller (1984) analysed 153 federal court cases, focusing on
age discrimination, and Schultz and Petterson (1992) analysed race and sex discrimination. In
the UK, Barnard and Ludlow (2016) investigated whether EU-8 migrant workers were able to
enforce their rights by bringing claims before the UKET.
Many of these studies occurred before judgments were published online and, therefore, not
only entailed costly journeys to courts and registers, but also required the manual extraction
and tagging of the specific elements of the decisions (e.g., jurisdiction, location, gender of the
complainant). It is only since February 2017 that UKET decisions are published online.
Recently, Blackham (2021) and Irving (2012) concluded a quantitative analysis of employment
decisions, but despite having access to online judgments, some tasks still required manual
labour.
The limitation of this kind of analysis is that it associates judgment outcomes with pre-selected
features, and risks that there are relevant variables, which truly account for the outcome, but
which are not taken into account by the model (Ashley and Bruninghaus 2006). The UKET
website identifies the “jurisdiction code” of each judgment, such as “breach of contract”,
“public interest disclosure” and “unfair dismissal”. This is helpful because the cases are already
sorted by topic. However, despite the multiplicity of jurisdiction codes, many of them are
interrelated, such that their use may not be instrumental. Moreover, as explained earlier, the
reason for the decision may relate to circumstances that do not relate to the substance of the
jurisdiction code.
Lately, some machine learning techniques directly correlate facts with outcomes, without any
features having been preselected. These correlations may still be inadequate, because they do
not employ abstract legal concepts, drawn from statutes, case law or underlying legal
principles, which are normally used to explain a predicted decision (Ashley and Bruninghaus
2006). Moreover, the induced correlations may not correspond to patterns of reasoning which
are familiar to legal practitioners (Ashley and Bruninghaus 2006).
Deep learning models based on natural language processing handle the complexity and
subtleties of legal language, and, therefore, represent a step-forward. Deep learning models
based on natural language processing may, in particular, perform two tasks: extraction and
prediction, or a combination of both. Based on relevant information through extensive training
on large-scale legal corpora (extraction), these legal-specific language models are considered
to be accustomed to the vocabulary and writing styles of legal texts and can be further fine-
tuned to facilitate downstream legal judgment prediction tasks (prediction). Accordingly,
facilitated by the large-scale datasets, recent years have witnessed a surge in the application of
deep learning models to legal judgment prediction.
These models may be used to extract relevant information, with which legal professionals, and
potential parties to a court case, can be advised. The challenge of extraction from legal
documents is that they can be long, display a complex structure and legal terminology and, in
addition, datasets with domain-specific documents are often rare (Collarana et al. 2018).
6The retrieval of past judgments which can support a dispute at hand involves an automatic
identification of similar situations and suitable statutes or precedent and is a challenge still
under exploration. Competitions held recently, such as COLIEE, aimed at exploring the
application of natural language processing-based methods and providing benchmarks for the
legal case retrieval task. To tackle this challenge, some recent works attempt to model the
semantic relationships between legal paragraphs using BERT (Shao et al. 2020).
Beyond extracting information, deep learning models can be used for prediction. As an
example, the DataJust project, led by the French Ministry of Justice, aims at offering to the
public indicative benchmarks for compensation for personal injuries, with the aim of
encouraging out-of-court settlements. The project processes court decisions to extract and
exploit data concerning the amounts requested and offered by the parties to the proceedings,
the assessments proposed within the framework of procedures for the amicable settlement of
disputes and the amounts allocated to victims by the courts (Decree n.º 2020/356 of March 27,
2020 for the creation of an automated processing of personal data called ‘DataJust’). This could
be extended to employment tribunals, for example, as part of the mandatory conciliation phase.
Zhong et al. (2018) introduced TopJudge to address legal judgment prediction using multi-task
learning that combines three elements, namely, law articles, charges and terms of penalty.
Another notable contribution is the work of Ma et al. (2021) where an end-to-end framework
was built to predict legal dispute outcomes with multi-task supervision and multi-stage
representation learning. Inspired by the success of pre-trained language models, a number of
law-specific pretrained language models have been proposed, such as LegalBERT (Chalkidis
et al. 2020) and Lawyer-LLaMA (Huang et al. 2023) for English and Lawformer (Xiao et al.
2021) for Chinese texts. A group of American academics has developed a machine learning
application that predicts the outcome of a case at the Supreme Court of the United States
(SCOTUS) with an accuracy of 70.2% (Katz et al. 2017). The most extensively discussed
application predicts decisions of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). This tool uses
natural language processing and machine learning to predict whether or not the Court will rule
that a particular provision of the ECHR has been violated (Aletras et al. 2016).
Within the framework of the European Union, Recital 40 of the Proposal for an AI Act states
that AI systems “intended to assist judicial authorities in researching and interpreting facts and
the law and in applying the law to a concrete set of facts” should be qualified as high-risk, not
including AI systems “intended for purely ancillary administrative activities that do not affect
the actual administration of justice in individual cases”. The latter refer to mere back-office
tasks, such as the anonymisation of court documents, the communication between personnel
and the allocation of resources. As a consequence, AI systems, which allow for researching
and interpreting facts and the law, and which might be used by judicial authorities, must be
cautiously designed and developed to ensure that models are trained with sufficient accurate
and domain specific input data. This applies to both extraction and prediction tools.
If predictive systems are developed and provided by private companies, it is likely that
employers, given the superior resources at their disposal, will be in a better position than the
employees to access these systems and, therefore, be in a better position to access and
understand quantitative information on the chance of tribunal success and the likely level of
financial remedies (Adams et al. 2022). Therefore, it would be important to counterbalance this
trend with a development of a predictive system to be at the disposal of the general public.
Extraction and prediction still pose some challenges. This paper demonstrates that to
effectively develop a useful and accurate prediction model, it is crucial to first analyse the
results produced by an extraction model. This paper evaluates the performance of GPT-4 for
7the extraction of annotations, which proves to be very useful and reliable for few-shot
annotations in these settings. GPT-4 can accurately identify the facts, claims and outcomes, as
well as the essential reasons for decisions through an extraction task, and thereby challenge the
apparent similarity of cases by pinpointing the critical criteria, or features, that dictate the
outcome of judgments. With its results, it is possible to identify judgments which should not
be part of a prediction model dataset. This paper also highlights the pitfalls that an extraction
and prediction model may have, even in a simple scenario such as the UKET, and which must
be taken into consideration in the development of any model.
4 Information extraction using large language models
In this section, we introduce the data that we conduct our analysis on and the design of the
information extraction experiments using a large language model.
4.1 Data preparation
4.1.1 The Cambridge Law Corpus
In this research, the experiments and analyses are conducted based on the UKET subset
(denoted as UKET ) of the Cambridge Law Corpus (Östling et al. 2023).
ori
The Cambridge Law Corpus is a large-scale dataset for legal AI research, with over 350,000
court cases spanning over 53 courts in the UK. The cases in this dataset cover legal disputes
from the 16th century until June 2023, with the majority of cases decided in the late 20th century
and the 21st century. The UKET subset of the CLC contains 52,339 cases in total, spanning
ori
over a time period from 2000 to June 2023. Cases heard at the UKET cover a wide range of
issues, such as unfair dismissal, discrimination and breach of contract. Each case file in the
UKET dataset contains textual transcripts of a court decision, supplemented by a list of
ori
metadata such as date of filing, date of decision, place of hearing, jurisdiction codes, judges,
claimants, respondents and appearances at the hearing.
4.1.2 Stratified sampling of cases
Out of the 52,339 UKET cases, we selected a subset of 260 cases using stratified sampling
ori
to make sure that our findings are statistically robust. The selected subset is denoted as
UKET . In the stratified sampling process, all UKET cases were first divided into strata
sub ori
using page count as a proxy, and then randomly sampled within each stratum. The resulting
numbers of sampled UKET cases are summarised in Table 1.

4.2 Information extraction
In this research, we explored the feasibility of utilising a recent large language model for
automatic extraction of legal information from case transcripts.
4.2.1 Large language models
Large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and its predecessors, represent a significant
leap forward in the field of artificial intelligence, particularly in natural language processing
(NLP). These models, trained on vast corpora of text from diverse sources, have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in generating coherent, contextually relevant text based on given
prompts. Their application spans various domains, from creative writing and chatbots to more
specialised fields like medicine and law.
In this research, we focus on a recently released large language model – GPT-4 (OpenAI 2023)
– the fourth iteration of the Generative Pre-trained Transformer series developed by OpenAI.
The architecture of GPT-4, while adhering to the transformer-based model introduced by
Vaswani et al. (2017), incorporates significant enhancements in terms of scale, training data
diversity and fine-tuning methodologies. These improvements enable GPT-4 to exhibit a
remarkable understanding of context, nuance and the subtleties of human language, surpassing
previous models in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. One of the defining features
of GPT-4 is its unprecedented scale, boasting an even larger number of parameters than its
predecessor, GPT-3, which itself was a monumental model at its time of release. This increase
in scale has been instrumental in improving the model’s performance across a variety of NLP
benchmarks, making it adept at tasks ranging from text completion and translation to more
complex challenges like problem-solving and creative content generation.
4.2.2 LLM-aided case annotation
The CLC provides raw texts of the transcripts of UKET decisions. These transcripts usually
contain inter-entangled statements about facts provided by parties and their lawyers, reasoning
towards a decision, legal statutes and precedents applied to justify the reasoning and final
decisions regarding the case outcome and further remedies. In this research, we explored using
a large language model, GPT-4 (OpenAI 2023) to automatically disentangle the information in
9the court transcripts and extract clean statements about eight aspects of legal information,
including facts of the case, claims made, references to legal statutes, references to precedents,
general case outcome, general case outcome in one of given labels, detailed order and remedies
and essential reasons for the decision. We utilised the 32k version of GPT-4 for all experiments
in this paper.
An input message to GPT-4 has the following format:
{‘role’: ‘system’; ‘content’: [PROMPT_TEXT],
‘role’: ‘user’; ‘content’: [INPUT_TEXT]}
The prompt text refers to the instruction that we provide for GPT-4 to conduct the extraction
task. We will discuss in detail our prompt engineering attempts in section 4.3. The input text
refers to the raw text of a UKET decision. Examples of the full extraction workflow are
illustrated in Annex A.
4.3 Prompt engineering
Prompt engineering refers to the process of designing and refining the instructions (or
“prompts”) given to AI models, particularly in the context of LLMs like GPT-4, to elicit the
desired outputs. This process involves crafting questions, statements or scenarios in a way that
guides the AI to understand the task at hand and generate accurate, relevant and coherent
responses.
Prompt engineering is crucial for harnessing the full potential of LLMs. Well-crafted prompts
can significantly improve the quality and relevance of the model’s outputs due to the following
factors:
1. LLMs are generalist models capable of performing a wide variety of tasks. Prompt
engineering allows users to specify the task they want the model to perform, whether it
is answering a question, generating text, summarising content, translating languages or
even more complex tasks like coding or composing music. The prompt acts as a task
descriptor, guiding the model on what is expected.
2. Through prompt engineering, users can provide context or background information that
helps the model understand the task better and generate more appropriate responses.
This is especially important for tasks that require domain-specific knowledge or
nuanced understanding.
3. Prompt engineering is also used to influence the style, tone and format of the model’s
outputs.
We followed the official guidelines on prompt engineering provided by OpenAI
(https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering/strategy-test-changes-
systematically). In particular, we adopted four of the six proposed strategies, namely: the
formulation of clear instructions, the provision of reference text, the splitting of complex tasks
into simpler tasks and the systematic testing of changes. As regards the formulation of clear
instructions, OpenAI suggests the following approaches: i) include details in the query to get
more relevant answers; ii) ask the model to adopt a persona; iii) use delimiters to clearly
indicate distinct parts of the input; iv) specify the steps required to complete a task; and v)
provide examples.
We applied an iterative development process to find the optimal prompt for our particular
purpose. To start with, we established what exactly the model must achieve. What should GPT-
4 extract from a judgment? First of all, to get an overall idea of the dispute, it is essential to
identify the main facts, the claims and the general case outcome. Employment law issues are
10governed by contractual provisions, collective bargaining agreements, statutes and case law.
Whereas contractual provisions and collective bargaining agreements are context-dependent,
anyone interested in understanding a legal question, and in predicting the outcome of the related
dispute, must identify the relevant sources, i.e., the references to legal statutes and references
to precedents (Dadgostari et al. 2021). Finally, as argued above, it is important to identify the
main reasons of the decision, but also to pinpoint whether the reasons for deciding a case are
procedural or substantive.
Following the second recommendation of OpenAI, we started the prompt by proposing a
persona to GPT-4: “You are a legal assistant. Your task is to read through the court decisions
that I will send you, and extract the following information for each input”. After some iterative
testing, we listed the required inputs, using numbers as delimiters to clearly indicate distinct
parts of the input, following the third recommendation of OpenAI: 1. facts of the case; 2. claims
made; 3. references to legal statutes and regulations; 4. references to precedents and other
court decisions; 5. general case outcome.
Concerning the identification of facts and claims, it is worth noting that after an initial judgment
deciding on the claimant’s application, the parties may each submit additional claims or
counterclaims, which are then decided in subsequent judgments (e.g., an application for costs).
Moreover, often there is a subsequent judgment ascertaining the specific remedies. We
observed that GPT-4 was often overinclusive in such subsequent cases, in the sense that it
included the description of the original claims as well as the facts connected to those claims, in
the facts and claims output sections, instead of referring exclusively to the facts and claims
made in the specific subsequent judgment. This occurred because UKET judgments often
report on earlier claims made, without clarifying in a way discernible for GPT-4 that the claim
made in the specific proceeding is narrower. The overinclusion of claims had problematic
consequences as regards determining the general case outcome, given that over-including
claims (i.e., including claims which are discussed in the original dispute, but are not under
consideration in the decision at hand), may lead to a “partly wins” output when in fact the
correct would be “wins” or “loses”. We avoided this limitation by including details in the
prompt to get more relevant answers (following the first recommendation by OpenAI). After
these amendments, the relevant part of the prompt read as follows: “1. facts of the case of the
specific court decision; 2. claims made in the specific court decision and considered in the
specific court decision. Do not include any claim which has already been decided in any
previous decision.”
Asking only for references to legal statutes and regulations proved to be too narrow. For
example, when the case file referred to the Equality Act 2010, GPT-4’s output was that there
are “no specific references to legal statutes and regulations”. The Equality Act was only
captured by GPT-4 if the prompt included the term “rules”. Also, GPT-4 did not always identify
the procedural tribunal rules. Although it seemed to identify “sections” interchangeably with
“articles” or “rules”, a more specific and detailed prompt delivered more comprehensive and
accurate outputs. Against this background, the final prompt reads as follows: “any references
to legal statutes, acts, regulations, provisions and rules, including the specific number(s),
section(s) and article(s) of each of them, and including procedural tribunal rules.”
Requesting a general case outcome sometimes led to unclear outputs. The simple prompt of a
general case outcome allowed GPT-4 to convey the outputs at its own discretion, which
sometimes led to mixing the claims, defences and reasons for the decision in the same output
section. Therefore, we specified the steps required to comply with the task, following the fourth
recommendation of OpenAI, thus subdividing the prompt into: general case outcome; general
case outcome (summarised in one of the four labels): “claimant wins”, “claimant loses”,
11“claimant partly wins” and “other”; and detailed order and remedies. This detailed order and
remedies section of the prompt directs GPT-4 to go beyond a mere indication of the general
case outcome in terms of which party is successful towards the exact content of the decision or
order made by the Tribunal. To avoid a result where the reasons for the decision are dispersed
over the outcome sections, we added a specific output section for the reasons. A more
segmented prompt consistently leads to complete and accurate outputs, and the introduction of
sections allows for a clearer distinction between facts, claims, outcomes and reasons for the
decision.
Regarding the four labels, “claimant wins”, “claimant loses”, “claimant partly wins” and
“other”, we noted a particular difficulty with the latter. GPT-4 often employed the label “other”
for disputes that were dismissed for procedural reasons. It also produced inconsistent results.
For example, it categorised a preliminary judgement, in which the tribunal allowed a case to
proceed even though the claim was submitted out of time as “other”, whereas similar cases
were instead classified as “won” or “lost”. To avoid such inconsistencies, we added an
explanation to the prompt: “Note that the label ‘other’ is to be reserved for situations in which
the result cannot be determined or where the outcome cannot be described in terms of winning
or losing (e.g., an evidence collection).” By providing an example in brackets we applied the
fifth recommendation by OpenAI.
When there are multiple parties to the proceedings, the output would be more accurate if GPT-
4 managed to specify the outcome for each of them. To achieve this, we introduced a further
stipulation: “if there are multiple claimants or respondents, extract the case outcome for each
and all of the claimants or respondents separately”. Although this specification generally
produces the desired detail, it fails in some cases. For example, in a case with 14 claimants,
GPT-4 extracted the outcomes for the first two claimants and then stated: “the information for
the other claimants can be similarly organised.” After testing different prompt variations
without solving this problem, we accepted this limitation.
To conclude, the final prompt used in this project reads as follows: “You are a legal assistant.
Your task is to read through the court decisions that I will send you, and extract the following
information for each input: 1. facts of the case of the specific court decision; 2. claims made in
the specific court decision and considered in the specific court decision. Do not include any
claim which has already been decided in any previous decision; 3. any references to legal
statutes, acts, regulations, provisions and rules, including the specific number(s), section(s) and
article(s) of each of them, and including procedural tribunal rules; 4. references to precedents
and other court decisions; 5. general case outcome; 6. general case outcome summarised using
one of the following four labels - “claimant wins”, “claimant loses”, “claimant partly wins”
and “other”. Note that the label “other” is to be reserved for situations in which the result cannot
be determined or where the outcome cannot be described in terms of winning or losing (e.g.,
an evidence collection); 7. detailed order and remedies; 8. essential reasons for the decision
(procedural and substantive). If there are multiple claimants or respondents, extract the case
outcome for each and all of the claimants or respondents separately.”
5 Quality check and assessment
5.1 Design of quality check
To evaluate the quality of the GPT-4 extractions, we asked a legal expert to manually check
the accuracy of the extracted information and the suitability for each case to be used for a
downstream prediction application. The manual check process was supervised by a senior legal
expert who helped to resolve questions, revised quality check guidance during the process and
12made additional random checks. The legal expert is qualified at post-graduate level and the
senior legal expert is a law professor. Both have previous experience in annotating legal data
in a machine-learning context.
The quality check is divided into two parts. The first part focuses on examining the accuracy
of each piece of extracted information by GPT-4. We investigated the eight individual factors
that were included in the prompt. The second part concentrates on the suitability of the
extracted information for a downstream prediction task. The aim of this second check is to
investigate whether the legal information extracted by GPT-4 has the potential to be used for a
prediction training dataset.
5.1.1. First part of the quality check
For the first part of the quality check, an extraction output is considered accurate if the results
of GPT-4 are generally correct against the background of the prompt and the information in the
case file provided. In essence, this quality check established whether GPT-4 delivers
information that is accurate and useful for a user such as a legal expert or an individual
interested in aspects of UKET decisions. We assigned a score of 0 or 1 to the output of each of
the eight extraction sections, namely: facts, claims, references to legal statutes, references to
precedents, general case outcome, general case outcome (summarised as one of the four
labels), detailed order and remedies and reasons. A score of 0 was assigned if the output was
inaccurate, whereas a score of 1 was assigned if it was accurate. The next paragraphs will
describe the accuracy test for each of the elements.
- Facts
A judgment comprises different types of facts: substantive facts (i.e., events before the tribunal
procedure), procedural facts (i.e., the actions taken in the procedure) and accessory facts (i.e.,
facts which are neither substantive nor procedural, and which are not under dispute). Our
prompt does not provide any instructions as to which facts should be extracted, as previous
attempts to induce GPT-4 to distinguish between substantive and procedural facts were
unsuccessful. Hence, facts that are extracted by GPT-4 comprise all aspects related to a case,
including substantive and procedural facts. We accepted both perspectives as valid in our
checks.
If substantive or procedural aspects are accurately described in the facts section, the extracted
facts are annotated as accurate. The facts section of GPT-4’s extracted output is annotated as
inaccurate when the extracted facts contain an error or when they are incomplete. The latter
occurs when the output facts do not reflect the workplace events discussed by the judge to
substantiate the applicable legal norms. If the dispute turned on the substantive facts and they
are not mentioned in the facts section, then the extraction output is classified as inaccurate (see
Example 2, Annex B). Where the decision does not summarise the facts at all, GPT-4 was not
required to deliver any facts, and an output stating that there are no relevant facts to report was
classified as accurate.
For judgments based on procedural reasons rather than substantive reasons (a “procedural
decision”), it is considered as acceptable for GPT-4 to omit these procedural events in the facts
section. This evaluation aligns with our principle that the facts section should be limited to
substantive facts. Also, procedural decisions often do not touch upon the substantive arguments
for or against a claim, as the claim is dismissed due to procedural aspects. In such cases, as
mentioned above, we consider the extraction to be accurate if the facts section expressly
indicates that the case file does not provide information about the facts of the case.
13The facts section may state “accessory” facts, such as the identity of the parties or the venue in
which the proceedings were concluded. If correct, such outputs are classified as accurate. For
an illustrative example, see Example 1 in Annex B.
- Claims
If the case file contains information about the claims raised, the claims are expected to be
retrieved by GPT-4. The claims section extracted by GPT-4 is classified as correct if GPT-4
accurately identifies the claim. When a case file does not contain information about claims
made, output stating “the document does not provide details of the specific claims made” is
considered accurate. We considered it essential that the absence of claims in the case file is
clearly indicated in the output. If a claim is explicitly described by the judge, then any output
that mentions a claim without detailing it or asserts that the claim details are not specified in
the file, is considered incorrect.
- General case outcome and detailed order and remedies
The general case outcome and detailed order and remedies sections were classified as correct,
if they were accurate and complete. If there were multiple claims, the output was required to
give the outcomes for each claim. As judgments vary, there are many different possible
combinations of general case outcome and detailed order and remedies. Just to give some
examples illustrating how these two outputs may complement each other: Concerning a
declaration claim, the general case outcome can be the description of the declaration, while the
detailed order and remedies section would mention that there are no specific orders or
remedies. Concerning claims for damages, the general case outcome may mention that the
claimant succeeded in relation to specific claims, while the detailed order and remedies section
could specify that the respondent is ordered to pay a certain sum to the claimant.
- General case outcome (summarised as one of the four labels)
Here, GPT-4 was expected to classify the general case outcome with one of the labels “claimant
wins”, “claimant loses”, “claimant partially wins” and “other”. The prompt specified that the
label “other” was reserved for situations in which the result cannot be determined or where the
outcome cannot be described in terms of winning or losing (e.g., an evidence collection).
- References to legal statutes and precedents
GPT-4’s outputs were classified as accurate if they included all statutory and other legal rules
and all case-law referred to in the case file. Any imprecision led to a categorisation as
inaccurate.
- Reasons
The reasons section was classified as correct if GPT-4’s extraction accurately identified the
facts which determined the outcome. If the judgment was based on the applicable substantive
rules (a “substantive decision”), the legal arguments which determined the outcome also had
to be included in the reasons section. If, on the other hand, the judgment was based on
procedural reasons (a “procedural decision”), those procedural aspects had to be identified in
the reasons section for the output to be considered as accurate.
5.1.2. Second part of the quality check
14The second part of the quality check focussed on establishing whether the extracted information
can be used to construct a computational prediction task. This is to showcase a potential use
case for the LLM-extracted information in the computational field. The prediction task aims to
predict the likely outcome of a UKET case based on the facts and the claims made in the case.
Three sections were examined: the facts, the claims and the general case outcome (labelled as
“claimant wins”, “claimant loses”, “claimant partially wins” or “other”) of the information
extracted by GPT-4. The relevant quality check is divided into two steps.
First, for a prediction model to effectively predict the most likely decision of a case, it needs
clear information about the facts and the claims as input. If any of these critical sections is
missing, the model cannot generate accurate predictions. The general case outcome (as one of
the four labels) is also necessary for establishing an outcome prediction task, as the outcome
labels will be used as gold-standard references to guide model training and testing.
When any of the three sections (i.e., facts, claims and general case outcome) is missing in the
GPT-4 extracted information for a case, we consider the case not being suitable to be used for
an outcome prediction task. If GPT-4 outputs information about the three sections, but that
information does not contain informative content, we also consider the case as not useful for
the task. For instance, when GPT-4 outputs, in the facts section, that “the document does not
provide specific facts of the case”, then the case is not useful for the prediction task. Similarly,
when the claims section mentions that the case file does not provide the claim, this is not
suitable for a prediction model. While these outputs were classified as correct (i.e., annotated
as “1”) in the first part of the quality check, which assessed accuracy, they are now classified
with a “0” at this step of the quality check, which assesses usefulness for a prediction model.
Second, the concepts of procedural predictability (which refers to a predictive system which
includes procedural actions of the parties) and substantive predictability (which refers to a
predictive system which excludes such procedural actions), mentioned above in section 2.1,
become relevant here. These case characteristics are distinguished here, since some users may
be interested in predicting the likelihood of success of a claim taking into consideration
procedural developments that may arise, i.e., they may be interested in the procedural
predictability. Others, in contrast, may wish to exclude procedure-based decisions from the
dataset, in order to have a system which focusses on substantive prediction. The development
of a model of interest to those who prefer the second perspective requires a second step in the
quality check. This second step identifies those case files whose facts sections are dominated
by procedural events.
Therefore, at the second step of this quality check, we evaluated whether the facts of a case
contain only or are dominated by procedural events and classified those judgments as
procedural (annotated as “1”). Such cases allow only for procedural prediction and would need
to be excluded from a dataset of a model focusing on substantive prediction. Overall, these are
judgments whose extraction outputs are dominated by procedural events in litigation as
opposed to events at the workplace.
As explained above, when there is a procedural decision, we did not require GPT-4 to include
procedural facts in the facts section. In such a case, the reasons section will clarify that the
judgment was determined by a procedural fact. Such a case will be classified as procedural. If
the facts section provides procedural information and is dominated by it, the judgment is also
classified as procedural. Examples for such judgments are those in which there is a withdrawal
of claim or non-compliance with an order, and for which it is not possible to establish how the
tribunal applied the law to the workplace dispute. To the contrary, decisions are annotated as
15substantive (i.e., with a “0”), if the facts mainly concerned workplace events (though they can
include procedural matters to a lesser extent). Such judgments can be used for a dataset to
prepare a substantive prediction model.
In summary, the second part of the quality check consisted of two steps and resulted in the
attribution of two numbers to each judgment, one number for each step of the second part of
the quality check. The first step classifies with a “0” those judgments whose facts, claims or
general case outcome (as one of the four labels) sections are either missing or non-informative,
because they correctly, but irrelevantly for a prediction task, state that the judgment does not
provide information about the facts or claims or because these sections consist only of
accessory information. The second step classifies those judgments which are dominated by
procedural events with a “1” to facilitate their exclusion from a dataset of a substantive
prediction model.
As a result, after the second part of the quality check, each judgment is classified by two
annotations. If the first annotation is “0”, the judgment does not allow for any kind of
prediction. If the first annotation is “1” and the second is also “1”, then the judgment is
dominated by procedural events, and may be included in a dataset if the users are interested in
procedural predictability. The judgments whose first annotation is “1” and whose second
annotation is “0”, generally allow for prediction and since they are not dominated by procedural
events, they allow the system to learn how the UKET applies employment law statutes and
regulations as well as case law to workplace conflicts.
5.2 Quantitative assessment
The accuracy scores of all extracted aspects for the 260 cases are summarised in Table 2. For
each accuracy score, we also computed its corresponding confidence interval with a confidence
level of 95%. It can be seen from the table that GPT-4 obtained perfect accuracy (i.e., 100%)
for the extraction of references to legal statutes and the extraction of references to precedents.
It also achieved near-perfect accuracy for the extraction of claims and general case outcomes,
with an accuracy score of 0.981 and 0.996 respectively. For the seemingly more challenging
tasks of extracting detailed case outcomes and constructing reasons from legal judgement texts,
GPT-4 surprisingly obtained a high accuracy of 0.996 for both tasks. Despite the relatively
lower accuracy compared to that of other aspects, the accuracy of GPT-4’s extraction of facts
and general case outcomes (summarised in one of the four labels) are still higher than 0.9,
highlighting the overall high accuracy of GPT-4’s extraction of legal information from diverse
legal texts.
Out of the 260 cases, around 47.7% of the cases (i.e., 124 cases) are marked as being suitable
to be used for a computational prediction task. Among these cases, 85 cases contain more than
1 page. This suggests that short court judgements usually do not contain sufficient information
about case facts, claims or outcomes for the judgement texts to be effectively used for a
downstream prediction task. We also analysed the accuracy scores and corresponding
confidence intervals for the 124 cases. The results are listed in the third column in Table 2.
Similar to those of the 260 cases, all extracted aspects yielded an accuracy higher than 0.9. The
accuracy for facts for the 124 cases has dropped compared to that of all 260 cases, whilst the
accuracy for general case outcomes (summarised in one of the four labels) has increased.

5.3 Qualitative assessment of information extraction
Generally, the extraction outputs were very accurate. Only the general case outcome given as
one of four labels had a higher degree of inaccuracy than the other sections. Annex A contains
two examples of the input case contents and GPT-4’s extracted outputs, the first one extracted
from a short case file, and the second one extracted from a longer case file. These examples
demonstrate the accuracy of GPT-4 for extraction purposes. The evaluation of GPT-4’s outputs
in terms of accuracy requires contextual consideration, not only of the operational mechanisms
of the system, but also of the information contained in the case files. This is particularly
important for the evaluation of the outcome sections.
To start with, when claims are for the payment of certain amounts, UKET judgments do not
necessarily refer to the amounts of the claim as originally submitted. Consistently, when
identifying the outcome of a certain claim, GPT-4 does not consider the original amount of the
claim or the subitems which are comprised within the same claim (e.g., holidays or wages). As
a consequence, GPT-4 classifies the outcome as “claimant wins”, and not as “claimant partially
wins”, in a situation in which a claimant is only partly successful (e.g., it was not possible to
show evidence of some elements of the damage and, therefore, the total amount of the initial
claim was not granted). We classified this as accurate, since the UKET case file did not give
the amount claimed. Independent of this, GPT-4 was expected to use the “partially wins” label
when the claimant submits multiple claims, and some are lost and the others won.
Since GPT-4 adopts the view of the claimant, when there are counterclaims and both the
claimants and the respondents’ claims are upheld, GPT-4 classifies the case as “partially wins”.
We accepted this approach as correct, since it applied a defensible logic and was applied
consistently throughout. When respondents submit a counterclaim, they are still referred to as
“respondents” in the case text, although, substantively, they are the claimants as regards the
counterclaim. Since GPT-4 always considers the claimants to be the original claimants, if the
respondents succeed on their own counterclaims, GPT-4 labels the outcome as “claimant
loses”. Applying the above principles contextually, we classified this as accurate.
Some cases are complex and raise annotation doubts even for human experts. For example,
when a claimant wins subject to a reduction for contributory fault, one could argue, on the one
hand, that because the amounts petitioned are not considered, but just the overall success of the
claim, the outcome should be labelled as “claimant wins”. On the other hand, considering that
the contributory fault is connected to a counterclaim of the respondent, which is also upheld,
the label “claimant partially wins” might be better suited. Indeed, GPT-4 took inconsistent
approaches to this issue, sometimes using the label “claimant wins” and sometimes the label
“claimant partially wins”. Whereas any of the views could be classified as accurate, we
17classified inconsistence as a mistake and only accepted one of these approaches as correct (the
“claimant partially wins” label).
GPT-4 displayed a surprisingly good grasp of the outcome label “other”. In a correction case,
GPT-4 correctly refused to apply a label, which indicates avoidance of “hallucination” or
improper inference where the data did not support a clear outcome. Similarly, in a case which
was settled out of court and the claims were stayed to allow for the implementation of the
settlement terms, GPT-4 correctly output the label “other”. As regards the label “other”,
labelling mistakes of GPT-4 were not a result of wrong classifications per se, but rather of
applying an inconsistent logic across all outputs for similar cases. For example, a difficult
labelling situation arises when the Tribunal does not decide on the claim and, instead, allows
it to proceed to a final hearing. Should the outcome be classified as “claimant wins”, because
the claim is not struck out, as the respondent requested, or as “other”, because the claim is not
finally decided? Again, we required GPT-4 to apply one approach consistently across all
outputs and treated the “other” label as correct. Finally, there was a labelling inconsistency of
GPT-4 across cases where the claims were withdrawn. Although the majority of the withdrawal
cases were accurately labelled as “claimant loses”, in the sense that the claimant did not
succeed, there were 16 cases in which GPT-4 labelled those cases as “other”, which we treated
as a mistake. The reason for GPT-4’s inconsistency might be that a withdrawal does not
correspond to a decision that directly disadvantages the claimant. Again, this point represents
a labelling inconsistency across the dataset, rather than an inaccuracy per se.
5.4 Discussion on the usage for a prediction task and procedural facts
In the first part of the quality check, we evaluated whether GPT-4’s extractions were accurate.
Having an accurate information extraction system is valuable per se, and it offers a strong
foundation for developing a wide range of downstream applications. One such downstream
application may be, for example, a case outcome prediction model that predicts future
workplace dispute outcomes based on facts and claims made. Given the strong impact that this
type of downstream application is likely to have on society, it is important to build strong
safeguards around its development and to be cautious about its limitations. For that reason, in
the second step of the quality check, we evaluated whether the information extracted by GPT-
4 (in particular, facts, claims and labelled outcomes) can be used to establish a computational
downstream task that predicts future workplace dispute outcomes based on facts and claims.
In the second part of the quality check, the human annotators were active actors, because GPT-
4 did not previously select the judgments which allow for substantive prediction. Instead, the
human annotators analysed and selected which of the judgments would allow for substantive
or procedural prediction, based on the outcomes produced by GPT-4 for the extraction task.
The second part of the quality check is a task of content analysis. We looked, first, at the facts
and claims sections and established whether they are informative or irrelevant. Secondly, we
looked at the facts section and determined whether the information contained therein is mainly
procedural or substantive.
Our manual evaluation revealed that approximately half of the cases are viable for
incorporation into a predictive analysis task, with a noticeable trend showing that most suitable
cases extend beyond a single page. This pattern suggests that the information extracted by GPT-
4 holds significant potential for constructing predictive tasks and for the training and evaluation
of predictive models. The observation that longer cases typically offer more substantive content
underscores their value as both input and output in computational tasks. This finding is
particularly relevant for those interested in using LLM-curated information for downstream
computational analysis. It also highlights the importance of case length as an indicator of
18informational richness, suggesting that more extended documents may provide a deeper, more
nuanced basis for analysis.
There is a relative limitation to the second part of the quality check and, overall, to the
substantive predictability of judgments. There are judgments which result from the
appreciation of the applicable substantive rules and the application of those rules to the
workplace dispute. Those are substantive judgments, which allow for substantive
predictability, in contrast to procedural judgments. The relevant second part of the quality
check identifies the judgments which are mainly based on procedural events, with the aim of
allowing to exclude those cases from a prediction task. However, as mentioned in Section 2.1,
some outcomes, even if based on a substantive appreciation of the dispute, may be strongly
influenced by the fact that the respondent does not produce evidence (written or orally; by not
attending the final hearing), or by the fact that the respondent did not present a response (Rules,
r. 21). These judgments are still based on a substantive appreciation of the law and of the facts
and are, indeed, substantive judgments, but are strongly influenced by procedural events. Those
cases would not be pinpointed by the second task of the second part of the quality check,
although they allow for a limited substantive predictability. Take, for example, the application
of r. 21. The lack of response or contest by the respondent, being a procedural issue, is not
necessarily indicated in the GPT-4 output facts section. Out of all the cases of our manually
verified dataset, 26 cases applied r. 21. Of those, 9 cases mentioned r. 21 in the facts, the
references to legal statutes and reasons sections, 10 cases mentioned r. 21 just in the references
to legal statutes and 7 cases mentioned it in the references to legal statutes and in the reasons
section, but not in the facts section. In other words, the majority of the cases only include r. 21
in the references. There is no lack of extraction accuracy in any of these scenarios. This
limitation inherently affects all predictive systems across various legal sectors, given that the
parties must present the evidence to the judges, and that certain legal rights need to be invoked
by the interested parties. Hence the concept of “procedural truth”, so familiar to law students
(in opposition to the actual truth, sometimes neglected). Nevertheless, this is a relevant
consideration to take into account, especially considering that the AI Act classifies these
systems as high-risk systems.
Another limitation of which users of these systems should be aware is that a prediction model
whose training dataset includes only tribunal case files does not take into consideration all the
elements that judges dispose of, such as the information included in the claim and response
forms. This seems an insurmountable obstacle where the dataset does not contain the relevant
information. Also, taking into account the judgments of a specific tribunal or court leaves
behind many disputes which were settled amicably out-of-court. In addition, two or more
claimants may submit their claims using the same claim form if their claims give rise to
common or related issues of fact or law (Rules, r. 9). Furthermore, in a situation in which there
are two different claims filed, involving the consideration of the same facts and legal principles,
the UKET may consider both cases at the same time, which is referred to as the claims being
“conjoined”, or “heard together”, and is regulated as a “group litigation order” in r. 19.22 of
the Civil Procedure Rules. These discussions outline the inherent complication of establishing
a predictive task based on the Employment Tribunal data constructed in this research, which
should be carefully thought through by designers and users of these systems.
6 Limitations
Our study provides valuable insights into the practice of employing LLMs for extracting
information from UK Employment Tribunal case documents, highlighting the efficiency and
potential accuracy of this approach. The adoption of GPT-4 for this extraction task is beneficial
in terms of time and budget efficiency. The extraction results are arguably satisfactory
19according to the manual quality check conducted by legal experts. Nonetheless, our findings
come with an acknowledgment of certain areas for improvement.
Distinguishing procedural and substantive facts in the prompt. GPT-4 does not always
mention procedural elements in the facts section. This leads to incomplete factual descriptions.
In those cases, the reasons section may often (but not always, as the discussion of r. 21 above
demonstrates) add procedural details, for example by clarifying that there was a withdrawal, or
that the respondent did not appear or present a response, which might have determined or
influenced the outcome. However, the outputs of the reasons section cannot be included in the
training dataset of a prediction model, since it would lead to data leakage. Our prompt specifies
that the reasons section must include procedural and substantive elements, specification which
is not included as regards the facts section. Perhaps a similar clarification for the facts section
could result in more complete factual descriptions.
Access to the actual facts and claims of the cases. This limitation is only relevant for the
discussions on the prediction task that we showcased in section 5.4. The facts and claims
produced by GPT-4 are extracted from tribunal decision transcripts, i.e., the judges’ written
decisions at the end of the proceedings. Since the judges know the result of the case at this
stage of the process, the texts they write may inherently contain biased information. For
example, sentiment words in the judges’ statements might implicitly reveal their inclinations
towards certain decisions. When trained on such data, the models might incorporate such
factors when making predictions related to case outcomes. While we believe that the LLM-
extracted facts and claims have the potential to be used as a practical substitute to the actual
facts and claims submitted by parties before a hearing, we acknowledge that this approach
could potentially introduce information biases at the input stage of the prediction task. In
subsequent research, we will explore alternative methods of identifying facts and claims to
better approximate the original submissions to the court, thus fostering a more realistic
modelling of judgment prediction.
7 Conclusion
The intersection of LLMs and legal AI is a burgeoning field, with significant potential for
transforming traditional legal workflows, enhancing access to justice and providing insights
that were previously unattainable due to the prohibitive costs of manual legal analysis. In our
experiments, GPT-4 has achieved strong results in extracting key information from decisions
of UKET. The first task required GPT-4 to extract information on facts, claims, general and
detailed outcomes, legal rules and case law applied as well as the relevant reasons. The second
task prepared a prediction experiment aiming to predict case outcomes based on facts and
claims raised. As this technology continues to evolve, its integration into legal practices is
expected to deepen, heralding a new era of legal AI where LLMs play a critical role in shaping
the future of the legal profession and research.

23Annex A
This annex provides two examples illustrating the overall workflow and results of extracting
legal information from UKET cases using GPT-4.
Example 1. Case 3328920/2017
Prompt to GPT-4:
You are a legal assistant. Your task is to read through the court decisions that I will send you,
and extract the following information for each input: 1. facts of the case of the specific court
decision; 2. claims made in the specific court decision and considered in the specific court
decision. Do not include any claim which has already been decided in any previous decision;
3. any references to legal statutes, acts, regulations, provisions and rules, including the specific
number(s), section(s) and article(s) of each of them, and including procedural tribunal rules; 4.
references to precedents and other court decisions; 5. general case outcome; 6. general case
outcome summarised using one of the following four labels – ‘claimant wins’, ‘claimant loses’,
‘claimant partly wins’ and ‘other’. Note that the label ‘other’ is to be reserved for situations in
which the result cannot be determined or where the outcome cannot be described in terms of
winning or losing (e.g., an evidence collection); 7. detailed order and remedies; 8. essential
reasons for the decision (procedural and substantive). If there are multiple claimants or
respondents, extract the case outcome for each and all of the claimants or respondents
separately.
Input text to GPT-4:
See text in
https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a7d7e5e40f0b64fe6c240d5/Mr_Y_Mfunda_v
_Swaay_Child_and_Adolescent_Services_Ltd_3328920_17__Full.pdf.
GPT-4’s response:
1. Facts of the case: The case involves Mr Y Mfunda (Claimant) and Swaay Child and
Adolescent Services Limited (Respondent). The Respondent failed to present a response to the
claim. The Claimant was owed wages and claimed for unauthorised deduction from wages and
breach of contract related to mileage expenses.
2. Claims made in the specific court decision: The Claimant claimed for unauthorised
deduction from wages and breach of contract related to mileage expenses.
3. References to legal statutes, acts, regulations, provisions and rules: The case refers to
Rule 21 of Schedule 1 to the Employment Tribunals (Constitution and Rules of Procedure)
Regulations 2013.
4. References to precedents and other court decisions: There are no references to precedents
or other court decisions in the provided text.
5. General case outcome: The Respondent was ordered to pay the Claimant £6,690.75 (gross)
in compensation for the unauthorised deduction from wages. The claim for breach of contract
related to mileage expenses was dismissed as the Claimant is still employed and does not have
the right to bring a claim for breach of contract.
6. General case outcome summarised: Claimant partly wins.
7. Detailed order and remedies: The Respondent is ordered to pay the Claimant £6,690.75
(gross) in compensation for the unauthorised deduction from wages. The hearing listed for 14
May 2018 is cancelled.
8. Essential reasons for the decision: The Respondent failed to present a response to the claim.
The Claimant was found to be owed wages, hence the award for unauthorised deduction from
wages. The claim for breach of contract was dismissed as the Claimant is still employed and
does not have the right to bring a claim for breach of contract.
24Example 2. Case 2301070/2018
Prompt to GPT-4:
The same prompt as used in Example 1.
Input text to GPT-4:
See text in
https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5ce5071ced915d2482756121/Mr_A_Martin_v
__1_Southwark_Council_2_The_Governing_Body_of_Evangelina_Hospital_School_-
_2301070_2018.pdf
GPT-4’s response:
1. Facts of the case: The claimant, Mr A Martin, is a teacher employed by Southwark Council
and the Governing Body of Evangelina Hospital School. He alleges that he was required to
work more than the statutory limit of 1265 directed hours per academic year without additional
pay, amounting to unauthorised deductions from his wages. He also alleges that he made
protected disclosures about this issue, which led to detrimental treatment.
2. Claims made in the case: The claimant made two main claims. Firstly, he claimed for
unauthorised deductions from wages due to being required to work beyond the statutory limit
of directed hours without additional pay. Secondly, he claimed that he suffered detrimental
treatment as a result of making protected disclosures about this issue.
3. References to legal statutes, acts, regulations, provisions and rules: The case refers to
the Employment Rights Act 1996, specifically section 13 relating to unauthorised deductions
from wages. It also refers to the School Teachers’ Pay and Conditions Act 1991 and the
Employment Tribunals (Constitution and Rules of Procedure) Regulations 2013, particularly
rules 2, 37 and 39.
4. References to precedents and other court decisions: The case of Agarwal v Cardiff
University is mentioned, which confirmed that a Tribunal may determine the construction of a
contract of employment in an unauthorised deduction from wages claim. The case of
Chesterton Global v Nurmohamed is also referred to in relation to whether the disclosures made
were in the public interest.
5. General case outcome: The Tribunal struck out the claimant’s claim for unauthorised
deductions from wages, finding that it had no reasonable prospect of success. The claimant’s
protected disclosure claim was partly struck out, with one alleged disclosure having no
reasonable prospect of success. The Tribunal refused the respondents’ applications for a strike
out or deposit order on other grounds. The claimant’s application to add two additional
respondents was also refused.
6. General case outcome summarised using one of the following four labels: ‘Claimant
partly wins’.
7. Detailed order and remedies: The Tribunal did not order any remedies as it struck out the
claimant’s claim for unauthorised deductions from wages and partly struck out his protected
disclosure claim. The Tribunal also refused the respondents’ applications for a strike out or
deposit order on other grounds and the claimant’s application to add two additional
respondents.
8. Essential reasons for the decision: The Tribunal found that the claimant had no legal
entitlement to pay for directed hours worked over the statutory limit of 1265 per year, and
therefore his claim for unauthorised deductions from wages had no reasonable prospect of
success. The Tribunal also found that one of the claimant’s alleged protected disclosures had
no reasonable prospect of success as it was a disclosure to a third party that no one from the
respondents saw. The Tribunal refused the respondents’ applications for a strike out or deposit
25order on other grounds and the claimant’s application to add two additional respondents,
finding that the balance of prejudice tipped in favour of the respondents.
26Annex B
This Annex contains extractions from GPT-4’s output for particular case files identified by
case number. The original case file can be found on the official website of the UKET,
https://www.gov.uk/employment-tribunal-decisions. For each case, GPT-4 has produced
outputs for each of the eight sections. Due to limitations of space, we merely present the
sections which are relevant to illustrate the points mentioned in the main text.
Example 1: case number 3305262/2021. Illustration of a judgment whose facts section
containing accessory facts was classified as accurate.
1. Facts of the case: The case involves Ms Tanika Harrison (claimant) and Network Rail
Infrastructure Limited (respondent). The case was heard remotely via telephone due to COVID-
19 restrictions.
2. Claims made in the specific court decision: The claimant, Ms Tanika Harrison, had made
a claim for unlawful deduction of pay. However, this claim was dismissed upon withdrawal.
Example 2: case number 2602938/2022. Illustration of a substantive judgment whose facts
section was classified as inaccurate because it did not refer to the substantive elements of the
dispute. Specifically, the facts section lacks the essential aspect, the unauthorised deductions.
1. Facts of the case: The claimant, Mr G Steadman, issued a claim in the Midlands East
Employment Tribunals on 10 December 2022 against the respondent, Riatex Limited. The
respondent failed to present a valid response on time.
2. Claims made: The claimant alleged that the respondent made unauthorised deductions from
his wages.
8. Essential reasons for the decision: The decision was made in accordance with Rule 21 of
the Employment Tribunals Rules of Procedure 2013 due to the respondent’s failure to present
a valid response on time. The respondent was found to have made unauthorised deductions
from the claimant’s wages.
Example 3: case number 4107496/2014. Illustration of a judgment whose claims section was
classified as incorrect. When the claims are not provided in the text, this must result clearly
from the output, or otherwise the section unduly hints that there is an identified claim when
there was not one.
2. Claims made in the specific court decision: The claimant, Mr W Mollan, had made a claim
against the respondents, Arrow XI Limited, but later withdrew it.
Example 4: case number 1302495/2017. This case demonstrates that when the reasons for
decision are missing, it might still be possible to make inferences from the facts, claims and
outcomes sections. In the quality check concerning the prediction task, this case was classified
as suitable for a prediction dataset and not dominated by procedural aspects.
1. Facts of the case: Miss M Gugiu, the claimant, was an employee of Vv S Diner Limited,
the respondent. The respondent did not attend the hearing. The claimant alleged that she
suffered an unlawful deduction from wages, was not paid holiday pay, did not receive notice
pay, and did not receive a statement of terms and conditions.
2. Claims made in the specific court decision: The claimant made four claims against the
respondent:
- Unlawful deduction from wages (£1627.50)
- Unpaid holiday pay (£196.35)
- Unpaid notice pay (£300.00)
- Not receiving a statement of terms and conditions (£600.00)
5. General case outcome: The court ruled in favor of the claimant, Miss M Gugiu. The
respondent, Vv S Diner Limited, was ordered to pay a total of £2723.85 to the claimant.
276. General case outcome summarised using one of the following four labels: “Claimant
wins”.
8. Essential reasons for the decision (procedural and substantive): The court decision does
not provide specific reasons for the decision. However, it can be inferred that the court found
the respondent to be in violation of employment laws regarding wage deductions, holiday pay,
notice pay, and provision of terms and conditions.
