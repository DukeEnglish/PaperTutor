zone. We assume a finite grid of identical zones for each
nominal segment to facilitate alternative path generation in
the event of congestion. The grid is so positioned that the
nominal zones are a subset of the grid and bisect the grid
(shown in Fig. 3b). The length of the grid (that is the length
of the nominal segment) is significantly larger than the width.

respectively. We define the congested regions as follows.
Definition 1. A zone is said to be congested if M or more
than M number of UAS are present in the zone.
L and M are UTM design parameters. Note that the
congestion in the zone is due to UAS transitioning on the
givensource-destinationrouteaswellasduetoanyexogenous
UAS coexisting in the workspace. The grid construction is
UAS-agnostic. The UAS can extract the grid geometry from
the nominal segment information shared by the UTM. Within
the zone, the heading of the UAS would be restricted so
that UAS would only transition on a subset of cells. The
heading constraint is position-dependent, for example, when
UAS is in the nominal segment it is restricted to transition
in the upstream direction. A UAS in a zone can detect or
communicate with other UAS coexisting in the zone and
its respective neighborhood. By knowing the UAS present
positions, the heading constraint imposed, and that any UAS
would complete one transition in one timeslot, we assume the
UAS using a linear kinematic model can predict other UAS

sufficient accuracy.
The UAS on reaching a node needs L transitions on the
nominal segment to reach the neighboring zone. Since a L
slot look-ahead time window is assumed, when the UAS is
at a node and finds the neighboring zone is likely to turn
congested in the next L slots, then the UAS could decide to
avoid the neighboring zone.
Definition 2. From the perspective of a UAS in zone Z
(depicted in Fig. 4), the neighboring zone Z′ will likely be
congested if the number of L slot look-ahead UAS predicted
positions in zone Z′ is greater than or equal to M.
The congestion definition introduced for the nominal zone
applies to all the zones in the grid. However, the decisions
of UAS present in an arbitrary zone Z = (X,Y) are only
influenced by congestion occurrences in one or two of its
neighboring upstream zones, which are,

The Conflict Detection and Resolution (CDR) methods

maneuvers. The UAS is assumed to be enclosed in a virtual
