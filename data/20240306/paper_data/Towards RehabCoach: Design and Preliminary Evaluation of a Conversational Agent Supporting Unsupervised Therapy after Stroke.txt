in a first iteration of the RehabCoach app design, to collect

evaluating usability.
In this paper, we describe the interdisciplinary develop-
ment and preliminary usability assessment of RehabCoach.
The primary goal is to assess whether individuals after a
stroke can successfully interact with such a digital tool
after minimal instructions. The secondary goal is to col-
lect quantitative and qualitative feedback on the usability
of RehabCoach and gather suggestions for improvements
from both primary and secondary users, which could help
drive the design of future digital interventions supporting
rehabilitation after stroke. Fig.1. ScreenshotofthemainmenuoftheRehabCoachapp.
