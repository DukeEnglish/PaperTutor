Abstract. This study evaluates the health effects of long-term expo-
sure to PM in Seoul. Building on the preliminary model [22], an in-
10
silico agent-based model (ABM) is used to simulate the travel patterns
of individuals according to their origins and destinations. During the
simulation, each person, with their inherent socio-economic attributes
andallocatedoriginanddestinationlocation,isassumedtocommuteto
and from the same places for 10 consecutive years. A nominal measure
of their health is set to decrease whenever the concentration of PM
10
exceedsthenationalstandard.Sensitivityanalysisoncalibratedparam-
etersrevealsincreasedvulnerabilityamongcertaindemographicgroups,
particularly those aged over 65 and under 15, with a significant health
decline associated with road proximity. The study reveals a substantial
health disparity after 7,000 simulation ticks (equivalent to 10 years),
especially under scenarios of a 3% annual increase in pollution levels.
Long-term exposure to PM has a significant impact on health vulner-
10
abilities, despite initial resilience being minimal. The study emphasises
theimportanceoffutureresearchthattakesintoaccountdifferentpollu-
tion thresholds as well as more detailed models of population dynamics

1 Introduction
Exposure to air pollution has been extensively studied in order to comprehend
howhealthconsequencesofairpollutiononpopulationscanvarygreatly[7].Ac-
cording to some studies, exposure levels vary depending on one’s socioeconomic
profile, i.e. the young and old, the socially disadvantaged, and those living near
pollutedareashavehigherexposureandhealthrisk[18,10,11,4,14].AirPollution
andInequalitiesinLondon2019[24]statedthatthemostdeprivedcommunities

trations of these pollutants and population exposure in London have decreased
since 2013, there are still disparities in exposure in more deprived areas, as well
as across age and ethnic groups.
To investigate the association between air pollution, socioeconomic status,
and health, both top-down approaches, such as spatial interpolation and dis-
persionmodels,andbottom-upapproachesusingsensorsandGPSgadgetswere
used.Whilethetop-downmethodshadtheadvantageofindicatingapopulation-
wideexposuremeasure,thelimitationisthattheexposuresweremeasuredwith
an aggregated figure (annual mean of PM ), vaguely assuming that the pop-
10
ulation’s exposure happened at their home locations [25,4,1,14,3,17,2]. Studies
usingbottom-upmethods,ontheotherhand,havesignificantlydiscoveredmore
sophisticated exposure levels by tracking people’s mobility, but the small num-
berofparticipants,time-consumingrecruiting,andshort-termmodellingperiod
wereinsufficienttogeneralisethefindings[23,8,13,21,12].Thus,despiteadvances
in tools and data, the translation between air pollution, exposure, and health
effects across individuals has remained highly uncertain.
Agent-based modelling (ABM) is one of the methods to generate an individ-
ual’s unique attributes (e.g. age, gender, area of residence), mobility patterns,
and association with air pollution. Typically, the individuals are situated in a
confined space and time and move across tessellated or networked neighbour-
hoods according to the geospatial structure. This can advantage enable us to
quantify the cumulative exposure to air pollution of each individual and the
adverse health consequences.
This paper investigates the cumulative effects on population exposure to
PM , individual’s socioeconomic backgrounds, and the mobility patterns of
10
population health. The specific research questions are:
– How can personal exposure translate to a health risk?
– How do demographic background and mobility patterns potentially affect
health outcomes?
– How could the population health outcome differ by future pollution scenar-
ios?
Building upon the proof-of-concept model made by Shin and Bithell [22],
this study expanded an in-silico agent-based model (ABM) to all 25 districts of
Seoul.
2 Methods
2.1 Data Collection
Pollutants AseriesofhourlyPM wascollectedfromthenearestbackground

stationsfromeachdistrictbetween1January2010and31December2015,then
was grouped by home hours (assumed to be 20:00–08:00) and working hours
(09:00–19:00). To account for some missing observations in the data (e.g. 2.15%
in Gangnam and 785 hours due to periodical inspections), we used a Kalman
algorithm to fill the missing values using an ImputeTS package in R [16].Quantifying Population Exposure to Long-term PM using ABM 3
10
Demographics Age was included, as health risks to air pollution can depend
on personal physical condition, and in general, are prominent in vulnerable age
groups [19,20]. The 2010 population data of Seoul by a five-year interval were
grouped as 5-9, 10-14, ..., 80-84, and over 85.
Land Price The Official Land Price was selected as a proxy for the rate of
recoveryfromtheeffectsofairpollution(seeFigure1).Residentialpropertywas
chosen not only because it represents immovable and location-specific capital,
but also because it expresses price in the economy: those who can afford higher-
priced housing may be better able to access health care or adjust their lifestyle
to compensate for high pollution levels.

health changes determined by land price in Korean currency ($1≈₩1,200) (b)
Origin-Destination Origin-destination matrices for Seoul were used to infer
the population’s home and work locations. Given the fact that OD matrices
produce a coarse temporal resolution, namely two locations per day, the study
assumed that the population moves across the land cover of either Residential,
Commercial, or Traffic areas that would be likely for home and work locations.
2.2 Agents
PopulationSampling Weuseda5%populationsampleofagentstogeneratea

including home location, work location, age group (i.e. young, active, or old),
and health.
NominalHealth Sinceindividualhealthrecordsorexposurehistorieswereun-
available, agents were assumed to have had no prior exposure. As a result, our
simulation only simulates the likely rate at which agents accumulate exposure4 Hyesop Shin
effects over time in a given district. Each agent is given a ‘nominal health’ level,
whichisanintegerwithavalueof300atthestart.Dependingontheirsocioeco-
nomic status, they will incur a decline in health if exposed to PM levels above
10
a threshold near 100µg/m3, which is South Korea’s hourly air quality standard.

will activate.
Agent Behaviour The model’s agents have limited reasoning abilities (see
Figure 2). Their behaviour are entirely driven by a simple timetable. All agents
adhere to the following hypotheses:
– An agent’s birth, death, and ageing are not considered
– Agentsunderstandtheirorigin(home)anddestined(work/school/outdoors)
locations but have no cognitive perception
– 1 tick is equivalent to half a day, that is, Work hours (09-19 hrs), Home
hours (20-08 hrs)
– Everyagentstartswithahealthstatusof300,butthisdropswhentheagent
is exposed to PM over 100µg/m3
10
– Agents move from and to either residential, commercial, or traffic areas
– Agents commute to the same location until the simulation ends
– For visualisation purposes, if the health status of an agent drops below 200,
the agent’s colour turns purple; when it drops below 100, the colour turns
red
– If an agent’s health reaches 0, the agent will be sent to the hospital for
treatment
– All agents stop if the system reaches 8764 ticks (equivalent to 12 years) or
if the ‘at risk’ population reaches 100% of the total population
Movement Agentsbetweentheagesof15and64commutewithinasub-district
but can also move to different sub-districts based on the origin-destination ma-
trix. Agents under the age of 15 will move to a random patch within radius 3,
while those over the age of 65 will move to a random patch within radius 1: this
is intended to represent a more limited range of movement for this demographic
group. We simplified movement by translating the agents to their destination
patch during the day (one tick) and back to the home patch at night (the next
tick)becausethetrafficflowisnotconsidered.Agentswhotravelwithinthedis-
trict are assessed, whereas those who travel beyond the boundary are excluded.

This study used the equation of Shin and Bithell [22] that set the rate of
change of an individual’s health status caused by PM exposure to varying

– α: the rate of change per unit of time when the health impact applies
(0<α<1). Agents’ health values would decrease exponentially away from
their initial value H(0).
– η: An additional health loss parameter that is age dependent (same as the
α effect but tweaked after validation)

parameter, parameters for road pollution were also tested in the following
section.
The agent exposed to PM above the threshold will steadily lose its health.

Health Outcome This study coins the term “at-risk” population to assess
the overall health outcome. An agent who is “at-risk” means the individual’s
nominal health is below 100 (i.e. a third of the initial health condition). The
“at-risk”populationmeansthenumberofpeoplewhosenominalhealthisbelow6 Hyesop Shin
100, and the at-risk rate is computed from the following equation: “at-risk”
population / population. This study uses at-risk, health risk, health outcome,
and the population at-risk interchangeably.
3 Model Interface
The model environment was derived from a GIS data set of each district (see
Figure 3). For simplicity, building and traffic information was excluded for the
present.ThespatialextentofGangnam,Mapo,Gwanak,andJongno,below,are
around 40km2, 24km2, 30km2, 24km2, respectively, with a 30m × 30m spatial
resolution. This study simulated 12 years using two time-steps per day (home
hours and working hours), with the earlier six years of PM coming from the
10
observational data set. The first six years for which data was available were
reused but modified to create scenarios for future projections for the latter six
years.

4 Sensitivity and Calibration
We assessed the main factors that distinguish the size of the total at-risk pop-
ulation and then calibrated the population with hospitalised patients. For each
parameter, a one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) analysis was used.
4.1 Measuring Sensitivity to the Risk Population
Two parameters were included for the sensitivity analysis: health loss and road
proximity. Gwanak and Gangnam were chosen for their similarity in area size,
but also for the distinctiveness of land prices (recovery rate), as they representQuantifying Population Exposure to Long-term PM using ABM 7

4.2 Calibrating Unwell Agents to CDC Patient Data
DataDescription Themodelcountedthosewithahealthscoreof0orloweras
being in a hospital for treatment. The Korean CDC (Center for Disease Control
andPrevention)database,knownasHIRA,madehospitalpatientdataavailable.
The database extracted respiratory patients (sections J01-J99) from 2016, ex-
cludingJ00(commoncold)andpatientstreatedbymedicalherbalists(acupunc-
ture, moxibustion and so on). The data was provided for non-commercial pur-
poses at a cost of about $300 per year.
Sinceeachpatient’shomeaddresswasanonymised(legalprivacyprotection),
this study summed patient statistics from all Seoul hospitals by age groups in
five-year intervals, e.g. 5-9, 10-14. To match the outcome of the simulation that
used5%ofthecensus,thetotalnumberof230,962patientsfromeachagegroup
was reduced to a fraction of 5%. Finally, patients from each district were added
and compared to the final figure from the BAU-AC100 scenario.
Calibrated results From 25 district outcomes of the BAU-AC100 scenario,
the total number of patients from the model made a reasonable approximation
to the observed data (see Figure 5). The majority of the group had a difference
of <100 between the modelled and observed values. The difference between the
model and the observation might be reduced to less than some percentage of
the total, and the variance in the model runs was typical of a similar order ofQuantifying Population Exposure to Long-term PM using ABM 9

5 Scenario Analysis
5.1 Scenario Description
Following the model’s calibration, this study set two ‘what-if’ scenarios for pol-
lutiontrendsandtwoscenariosforadaptivecapacitycontrol.Toavoidstochastic
variability, the scenario results were averaged from 20 model runs.
Pollution Scenarios: Pollution scenarios consist of business as usual (BAU)
andincrease(INC).BAUrefersto,‘Whatiftheseasonalpollutionlevelscontinue
foranotherperiod?’,whichassumesthatthesix-yeartimeseriesofhourlyPM
10
in 2010–2015 will replicate itself for another six years. INC projects an upward
trend of the seasonal PM averages by 3% every season.
10
Resilience Scenarios: The scenario controls the agent’s maximum health to
which recovery is possible. The variable is assigned as the ‘adaptive capacity
(AC)’, and divided as AC100 and AC200, meaning that if the resilience is set
forAC200theagentwhosehealthgoesbelowanominalvalueof200recoversto
a maximum of 200.
5.2 Scenario Results
BAU Scenario: In the BAU×AC100 (see Figure ??-Top), the ‘at-risk’ pop-
ulation in most districts started to increase between 4500 and 6000 ticks, and
from 7200 ticks to the end of the simulation. This is to be expected given that
agents were given maximum health at the start of the simulation, and similar
health loss occurred across agents in the same group as PM generated from
10
each district monitor gave similar exposure levels.
1 The selected districts include Dongdaemoon, Gangseo, Guro, Gwanak, Gwangjin,
Jung, Jungnang, Mapo, Seocho, Yangcheon, and Yeongdeungpo, however, the ma-
jority of the patients were found from Gwanak and Mapo10 Hyesop Shin
Furthermore, the time-series plots revealed an oscillating trend. This may
have resulted from the balance between the exponentiality of health loss and
the linearity of resilience from the resilience scenario and the land price effect.
The districts with oscillating risk population trends were mostly in the AC100
scenario, with people aged 15 to 64. These groups appeared to be associated
with the balance between recovery rate and health degrading with exposure.
Thedistrictsthatdidnotexperienceoscillationrepetitionhadbeencontinuously
exposed to extreme PM episodes, presenting health recovery ineffective. The
10
oscillations only appeared in a few districts for the elderly group, but these
districts experienced a linear upward trend due to the group’s limited ability to
recover from illness.

Conversely, the variability for those aged 65 and above is less pronounced, indicating
a more consistent impact across scenarios.
Using the outcome of BAU×AC100 as a default structure, the highest risk
areas included Yeongdungpo, Mapo, and Guro, which had over 20% of the at-
risk rate (see Figure 7). The total percentage was greatly affected by the 15-64
age group (‘economically-active’) because the group accounted for the majority
of the city’s population.
INC Scenario:The‘at-risk’populationintheINCscenarioshowedasmall

The temporal trend of the at-risk population varied by demographic group.
While the over 65s had a constant increase until 7500 ticks with a final surge at
around 75%, the other two groups had a similar pattern that showed an initial
onset at 4300 ticks, plateaued for a while, and surged in the final quarter of the
simulation. Much of this occurred because the elderly lacked health resilience

6 Conclusion
This study examines the impact of exposure levels and socioeconomic resilience
on the health of Seoul’s population, utilising an agent-based model. The study
primarily analysed the sensitivity of health loss and additional pollution effect
on road patches assuming people’s home and work locations are nearer to roads
tended to trigger the risk.
The results from the scenario analysis indicate that vulnerability in all dis-
tricts begins to manifest early, at 4000 ticks, and then significantly increases
after 7000 ticks. This trend is closely linked to the point at which demographic
groups fall into poor health (i.e., health below 100) and the extent of health
recovery support available in each district. One possible explanation for this
pattern is the model’s initial assumption that all individuals start with a health
status of 300, an oversimplification that does not account for the varying health
conditions present in reality. The sharp increase in vulnerability is interpreted12 Hyesop Shin
as a response to accumulated exposure to particulate matter. Therefore, it is
suggested that future research should incorporate morbidity and, where possi-
ble, mortality statistics to provide a better understanding of the health impacts
of pollution exposure.
Moreover,thestudyrevealsthatthevulnerabilityoftheelderlyandindivid-
ualswithlowereducationlevelsrisessignificantlyacrossdifferentscenarios:over
10%intheBusinessAsUsual(BAU)scenarios,over30%intheIncreased(INC)
scenarios, and over 5% in the Decreased (DEC) scenarios, regardless of the re-
silience strategies implemented. These results build upon the work of Jerrett et
al.[9], O’Neill et al.[18], and Moreno-Jimenez [15], highlighting the influence of
long-term exposure to pollutants and geographical factors on health disparities,
particularly among groups vulnerable to the effects of biological ageing. The
study underscores the importance of considering the static nature of vulnerable
populations, such as the elderly, who may lack access to adequate healthcare
during pollution events. With a projected annual pollution increase of 3%, the
researchindicatesasharpriseintheaffectedpopulationafter7000ticks(equiva-
lentto10years),withinitialresiliencestrategiesagainstPM showingminimal

However,themodel’srelianceonapopulationproxyandtheselectionofpol-
lutiondataforeachlocationasasinglevaluehighlightsitsroleasan’illustrative
model’ rather than a direct replication of real-world scenarios [5]. It serves to
elucidate the potential variations in health outcomes across different districts
when exposed to pollution levels exceeding legal thresholds.
In conclusion, while providing valuable insights into the health effects of
PM exposure in Seoul at a mesoscale simulation, this paper calls for future

models of population dynamics and pollution generation. The goal is to better
