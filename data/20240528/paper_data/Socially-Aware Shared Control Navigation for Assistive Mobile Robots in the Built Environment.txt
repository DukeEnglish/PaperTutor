ABSTRACT
AsthenumberofPersonswithDisabilities(PWD), particularlythosewithoneormorephysical
impairments, increases, there is an increasing demand for assistive robotic technologies that can
supportindependentmobilityinthebuiltenvironmentandreducetheburdenoncaregivers. Current
assistive mobility platforms (e.g., robotic wheelchairs) often fail to incorporate user preferences
and control, leading to reduced trust and efficiency. Existing shared control algorithms do not
allowtheincorporationoftheusercontrolpreferencesinsidethenavigationframeworkorthepath
planningalgorithm. Inaddition,existingdynamiclocalplanneralgorithmsforroboticwheelchairs
do not take into account the social spaces of people, potentially leading such platforms to infringe
upon these areas and cause discomfort. To address these concerns, this work introduces a novel
socially-awaresharedautonomy-basednavigationsystemforassistivemobileroboticplatforms.
Our navigation framework comprises a Global Planner and a Local Planner. To implement
the Global Planner, the proposed approach introduces a novel User Preference Field (UPF)

Control-basedModelPredictiveControlwithDynamicControlBarrierFunction(SS-MPC-DCBF)

Evaluation results show that our Global Planner aligns closely with user preferences compared to
baselines, and our Local Planner demonstrates enhanced safety and efficiency in dynamic and
staticscenarios. Thisintegratedapproachfosterstrustandautonomy,crucialfortheacceptanceof

BACKGROUND AND CHALLENGE
Lack of access to independent end-to-end (E2E) mobility has life-altering implications for
Persons with Disabilities (PWD). Mobility constraints in PWD reduce access to education,
healthcare, and employment; exacerbate physical and mental stress leading to other chronic
morbidities; and impose a significant burden on families, caregivers, the healthcare system, and
society (Mortenson et al. 2005; Fehr et al. 2000). In the United States alone, nearly 2.7 million
individualsexperiencingmobilityimpairmentsrelyonwheelchairsfortheirdailyactivities(Koontz
et al. 2015). This number is expected to grow 7% annually (Flagg 2009) due to significant
improvementsinpost-traumasurvivorship(withsomephysicalimpairments)andlongevity(Bureau
2016; King et al. 2013). Consequently, this growing necessity underscores the urgent need for the
development and implementation of innovative assistive technologies that implement efficient
systems for navigation and collision-avoidance, and can help PWD improve their mobility in the
builtenvironment. Assistivemobilerobots,designedtoaidthosewithmobilityimpairments,have
shownconsiderablepromiseinenhancingthequalityoflifeforPWD(Fardeauetal.2023). These
robots offer the potential for increased independence in the built environment, including homes,
workplaces,andpublicspaces.
A critical aspect of assistive mobile robots is their navigation system, which determines how
effectively and safely a robot can move through and interact with its environment (Rubio et al.
2019). These systems not only enable the robot to maneuver safely but also to adapt to specific
2user preferences and interact within dynamic spaces. For instance, user preferences could include
the robot maintaining a certain speed or going in a direction preferred by the user, which is
particularly crucial for users with physical disabilities who may require wider clearances to be
comfortable. Socially aware navigation, on the other hand, involves the robot recognizing and
respecting human social norms and personal spaces, such as not coming too close to people
or appropriately navigating around groups without causing disruption. A properly implemented
navigationsystemallowsassistiverobotstounderstandandadapttotheuser’spreferences,navigate
efficientlyincrowdedordynamicspaces,andinteractwiththeenvironmentinasociallyacceptable
manner(GaoandHuang2022).
The navigation system can be divided into a Global Planner and a Local Planner. The Global
Planner is responsible for generating an optimal and feasible path from start to destination, taking
into account the user’s specific preferences for the avoidance of crowded areas. This planner
ensures that the overall path aligns with the user’s needs and comfort. On the other hand, The
LocalPlannerhandlesreal-timenavigationbyadaptingtoimmediateobstaclesandenvironmental
changes,incorporatingsocialawarenessto sensitivelynavigatehumanenvironmentsandmaintain
appropriate distances from people. It also allows users to manually adjust the robot’s motion to
meettheirimmediateneedsandpreferences. AsshowninFig.1,theGlobalPlannercombinesthe

daily activities. In the absence of such features, users may experience significant challenges and
reluctance, as the lack of synchronization between user needs and the wheelchair’s operations can
lead to a diminished sense of autonomy and security. Moreover, by integrating social awareness,
anassistivewheelchaircananticipateandnavigatehumanenvironmentsmoregracefully,reducing
the cognitive burden on users and enabling smoother, more natural interactions within social
settings (Avelino et al. 2021). Without this capability, there are inherent risks that users may find

more transparent and responsive to immediate user needs. Inspired by (Lu et al. 2014), a User

LocalPathPlanning
Sincetheassistivewheelchairisdesignedtoserveusers,sharedcontrolplaysanimportantrole
in gaining people’s trust (Oksanen et al. 2020) and adapting itself into society (Yin et al. 2021;
Cubuktepe et al. 2023; Desai et al. 2009). Traditional navigation systems either consider a fixed
degree of human’s control command velocity as the primary input to operate the robot or make a
mobilerobotnavigateautonomouslywithoutahuman’scontrol. Theseapproachesfailtoconsider
the varying preferences of users, who may desire different levels of involvement in controlling the
robot, thereby affecting their satisfaction and the usability of the technology. Some navigation
methods,suchastheArtificialPotentialField(APF)(Petryetal.2010),allowusersafixeddegree
ofcontroloverthenavigationprocess. Whilethisapproachconsidersuserinput,itdoesnotaccount
forthevaryingdegreestowhichindividualsmaywishtocontrolthenavigation,potentiallylimiting
personalizationandusersatisfaction.
Furthermore, as users often are unfamiliar with the kinematics of a robotic platform (e.g.,
wheelchair), it is challenging for them to manually control the device to avoid all static and
dynamic obstacles in the environment. This unfamiliarity makes it difficult for users to manually
avoid obstacles, leading to potential collisions when mistakes occur in control. The current state
of the art does not adequately address these user-centric concerns, emphasizing the need for more
adaptableandintuitivecontrolsystemsthatcancatertothespecificneedsandskilllevelsofdiverse
users. This adaptability is essential for enhancing user experience and ensuring safe interaction
withtherobotincomplexenvironments.
To address this issue, this paper proposes a Socially-aware Shared control-based Model
5Predictive Control with DynamicControl Barrier Function (SS-MPC-DCBF) that enablesa Local
Planner to let the user adeptly take control over the obstacle avoidance problem. The proposed
method utilizes Dynamic Control Barrier Function (DCBF) to let the robot avoid the obstacles in
advanceandgenerateasafecollision-freetrajectory(Jianetal.2022). Additionally,auservelocity
prediction-based social area detection is integrated into the Local Planner to make the robot avoid
pedestrians’ personal space/area and adapt to the social environment. Finally, a user can make
their choice to take partial or complete control over the navigation process. This Local Planner
not only maintains a socially respectful distance from ambient humans but also facilitates a more
trustful and comfortable interaction for individuals controlling the robot, such as PWD navigating
a wheelchair. The integration of advanced control mechanisms and social awareness presents a
significantadvancementinthedevelopmentofuser-centric,sociallyawareroboticsystems.
ResearchObjectivesandContributions
Drawing upon the insights presented in (Petry et al. 2010; Jian et al. 2022; Wang et al. 2022),
we propose a socially aware shared control-based dynamic navigation system that takes the user’s
preference in path choosing and the user’s desire for control during the navigation process into
consideration. As shown in Fig 2, we divide our navigation system into two parts: Global Planner
used for global path choosing and Local Planner for executing the path plan and avoiding any
collisionswithdynamicobstacles. Generallyspeaking,oursharedcontrol-basednavigationsystem

First, toward the issue that a user cannot directly choose their own preference-based path,
our Global Planner takes the adaptive user’s path preference into consideration in the global path

example, if a user prefers quieter, less trafficked routes, the Global Planner can adapt to prioritize
thesepreferencesinitspathplanning. Thiscapabilitysignificantlyenhancesthenavigationsystem’s

Second, in order to let the robotic platform adapt to the social environment, our approach
integratessocialareas(spaces)intotheobstaclemodelingpipelineintheLocalPlannertoprevent
6the robot from getting too close to any pedestrians or obstacles detected. This integration ensures
the robot maintains a respectful distance from pedestrians and avoids encroaching on personal
spaces,therebypreventingdiscomfortorsafetyissues.
Third,tocreateasafeandefficientpathinadynamicenvironmentandavoidanyfuturecollision
with moving obstacles, we leverage the Dynamic Control Barrier Function (Ames et al. 2019) to
let the robot avoid the obstacles in advance, even when they are beyond a pre-defined proximity
threshold. This ensures a smoother and safer navigation experience, maintaining an efficient path
withoutsuddendeviationsthatcouldconfuseoralarmtheuser. Finally,toaddressthechallengeof

over the robot. Without these features, users might experience increased anxiety due to close
proximity to other pedestrians, potential collisions with unforeseen obstacles, and a feeling of
disconnection or lack of control over the robotic platform, ultimately leading to diminished trust
andsatisfactionwiththetechnology.

2017) proposed iterative A* for the user to choose their preferred path and utilize Support Vector
Machine (SVM) to allow the robot to imitate the users’ preference. Although some autonomous
navigation can generate an optimal path both globally and locally, the desire to feel safe and
comfortable is not taken into consideration, which can cause human-robot trust issues when the
robotnavigatesautonomously.
In the fully manual control field, a lot of work focuses on integrating people’s preferences
into the path planning pipeline and allowing the system to generate the user preference-based
path. (Yanco1998)proposedanassistivewheelchairsystemtoprovidedifferentpathandobstacle

2021;Cubuktepeetal.2023;Desaietal.2009). Someresearchfocusesonapplicationswithinthe
Global Planner, for instance, directly influencing global path planning through user input (Chang
et al. 2017). However, such methods tend to be relatively inefficient in practical operation and
may cause difficulties in human interaction. There are also studies proposing interfaces that allow
users to add obstacles to the global map (Karanam et al. 2022), but this approach might lead
to the problem of being unable to generate effective paths. Additionally, some prior studies have
focusedonapplicationsintheLocalPlanner. Forexample,researchbasedontheArtificialPotential
Field (APF) (Khatib 1986) method maps the user’s joystick operations as a force exerted on the
robot (Petry et al. 2010). However, this method carries the risk of the robot being "frozen" in

LocalPlannerforDynamicObstacleAvoidance
Inroboticsandautonomousvehiclenavigation,a"LocalPlanner"ispartofthemotionplanning
systemthatcalculatesshort-termpathsormaneuversfortherobotorvehicle. RegardingtheLocal
Planner, currently there are many solutions available in the literature. For example, the Dynamic
WindowApproach(DWA)(Fox1997)focusesongeneratingmultiplepathsfromtherobot’scurrent
state and then selecting the optimal one, considering both the direction of the robot’s goal and
obstacleavoidance. TheTimedElasticBand(TEB)(Verlag2012)visualizestheplannedpathasan
10elasticbandthatgetsstretchedorcompressedbasedondynamicconstraints,effectivelymoldingthe
pathaccordingtotheenvironment’sconstraints. TheArtificialPotentialField(APF)(Khatib1986)
method conceptualizes the robot’s movement as being influenced by artificial forces: attractive
forces pulling it towards the goal and repulsive forces pushing it away from obstacles, navigating
the robot through a balance of these forces. However, their performance can be significantly
impactedincomplexenvironments,suchasthosewithmanypedestrians(Kobayashietal.2021).
MPC (Model Predictive Control) is another widely used method in Local Planners, but most
MPC implementations focus on lane tracking and static obstacle avoidance (Rösmann 2020; Turri
et al. 2013) without further addressing obstacle avoidance for dynamic objects. To address
the dynamic obstacle avoidance and to enhance the robot’s obstacle avoidance capability, some
algorithms that integrate the predicted trajectories of moving objects into the MPC’s cost function
can greatly enhance dynamic obstacle avoidance capabilities (Poddar et al. 2023; Wang et al.
2022). TheseapproachesworkbyincludingthefuturepositionsofpedestriansaspartoftheMPC

However,adrawbackofthisapproachisthatMPCwillnotconfinetheoptimizationproblemifthe
distancebetweentherobotandobstaclesislargerthanadefinedsocialdistance.
Consequently, the robot only reacts when it is within a specified distance from obstacles.
However, in complex and dynamic environments, this fixed distance may not be sufficient for the
robottorespondandavoidobstacleseffectively.
To mitigate this, some researchers have added Control Barrier Function (CBF) (Ames et al.
2019) constraints on top of MPC to further improve safety (Zeng et al. 2021a; Zeng et al. 2021b;
Jian et al. 2022). CBF can be considered a constraint that keeps the robot away from obstacles.
By incorporating CBF as a hard constraint into the MPC’s cost function, the robot can make

tofurtheroptimizethenavigationapproach.
Socially-awareNavigation
Social navigation refers to the strategies and methods employed by robots to navigate through
environments that involve interaction with humans or other agents, focusing on maintaining safe,
socially acceptable, and efficient movement. It is introduced in the survey (Mavrogiannis 2023)
that it is a vast field, and there have been many related studies in the past thirty years. These
studies have evolved from initially focusing on simple engineering principles to now integrating
multiple fields, including human-robot interaction, psychology, and sociology. Here, we focus on
onespecificissue: howtointegratesocialcharacteristics,orhumaninformation,intotheplanning
processtoachievebetterresults. Forexample,byincorporatingdatasuchasthepositions,speeds,
and even postures and facial expressions of pedestrians, the robotic platform can more effectively
planitsavoidancepathsandinteractionswithpedestrians.
One of the most common and direct methods to incorporate human information is to predict
human behaviors (mainly motion trajectories) (Alahi 2016; Gupta 2018) and then integrate this
predictive information into planning. Examples of this approach include incorporating pedestrian
trajectory prediction into the cost function of an MPC framework (Wang et al. 2022; Poddar
et al. 2023). Some approaches are modeling human behavior and trajectories from a geometric or
topologicalrepresentationperspectivebeforeintegratingthemintotheplanner(Mavrogiannis2017;
Mavrogiannis 2020). Others, starting from social norms and human behavioral habits, introduce
social and psychological knowledge, such as the concept of social space described in their studies
(Hayduk1994;Poddaretal.2023).
Socialspaceisaconceptthatpertainstotheinvisiblebufferzoneindividualsnaturallymaintain
12around themselves to feel comfortable and unthreatened while moving in their environment.
Discovered through extensive observation and experimentation, it reveals that individuals have
a relatively comfortable personal space while walking (Kirby 2010). Based on social space, the
concept of social groups has been utilized to enable robots to avoid obstacles in dense pedestrian
environments (Gadol 1981; Wang 2020; Wang et al. 2022). The concept of social groups emerges
from substantial observation and experimentation to account for the collective movement and
interaction patterns of these groups, indicating that people often walk in groups. There are also
studiesnotfocusedonintegratingspecifichumanbehavioralinformationbutinsteadconcentrating
on learning the principles behind human behavior to enhance robot decision-making (Yu Fan
Chen;Liu2016).
In this paper, to enhance the navigational performance of robotic wheelchairs in complex
social environments, we have incorporated some concepts from social navigation. These include
the prediction of pedestrian trajectories, modeling of pedestrian social spaces, and ultimately
integrating this information into the MPC-DCBF framework so that our algorithm can achieve
safetyandefficiencyinnavigationwithincomplexenvironments,especiallyinpedestriansettings.

Here, the constructed OGM and articulated user preferences feed into the global planning module
to generate an initial navigational strategy. This global plan, along with inputs from 3D LiDAR

Inspired by (Kirby 2010), the personal space can be modeled as an Asymmetric Gaussian
function (AGF). This function is used in the literature to define the personal space decided by a
person’s velocity. Since individuals are usually more aware of people in front of them than the

In summary, our method starts by detecting people and predicting their velocity. With this
information, we create a social area around each person for the robot to recognize. The following
Local Planner treats these social areas as obstacles, which helps the robot avoid bumping into
people, making its movement safe and respectful of personal space in places where people are
movingaround.
SharedcontrolbasedsociallyawareMPC-DCBF
It has been proven that Dynamic Control Barrier Functions (DCBF), which consider the
movementofobstacles,canbeusedforunmannedaerialvehicles(UAVs)andmobilerobots(Zeng
etal.2021b;Glotfelteretal.2019;Singletaryetal.2020;Amesetal.2019). However,thecurrent
MPC-DCBF Local Planner shapes the obstacles as an ellipsoid based on the clustering result of
DBSCAN and does not take the user’s control into the path planning pipeline. This can lead to
two issues: First, since the ellipsoid generated from the clustering result is too close to the body
of the person, the robot will be very likely to generate a local path that intrudes into the personal
areaofotherpedestrians. Second,thecurrentMPC-DCBFmethoddoesnottaketheuser’scontrol

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
Our evaluation is divided into two parts - Global Planner evaluation and Local Planner
evaluation. In this section, we first introduce our experimental setup for the Global Planner
andtheLocalPlanner. Then,fortheGlobalPlannerevaluationpart,weevaluateourproposeduser
preference-based Global Planner by comparing it with the state-of-art user preference-based path
planning method over time, trajectory length, and error to the ground truth user desired path. For
the Local Planner part, we evaluate our SS-MPC-DCBF in both static and dynamic environments
bycomparingouralgorithmwithotherstate-of-the-artLocalPlanners.
ExperimentalSetup
We designed several different environments for testing the robot navigation system. Shown in
Fig. 10, we separate our experiment scenes into dynamic experiments and static experiments. For
the Global Planner evaluation, as shown in the right figure, we created an open area that simulates
a large office environment where the user’s preferences can be applied. In this open environment,
we enable the robot to pass the central obstacle and avoid going from the right side, where most
obstaclesarelocated.

25LocalPlannerEvaluation
As for the Local Planner evaluation, we separate our algorithm into two different experiments,
the static experiment and the dynamic experiment. For the indoor static experiment, we create a
challengingandnarrowcorridorenvironmenttotesttheperformanceofourSS-MPC-DCBFLocal
Planner. For the dynamic experiment, we designed three different crowded scenes for the robot to

controls. TheresultsarepresentedinFig.13.
The findings from our study reveal that the proposed SS-MPC-DCBF framework significantly
surpasses traditional fully manual and autonomous navigation modes in terms of efficiency and
user satisfaction. Although manual control provides the potential for users to have the most direct
routes,theirlackoffamiliaritywiththewheelchair’sdynamicsmakestherobothardtoavoidstatic
obstacles, increasing the risk of collisions and decreasing overall success rates. Furthermore, a
lack of knowledge of the robot’s dynamics often leads users to make excessive adjustments to its
directionwhennavigatingclosetoobstacles,leadingtotrajectoriesthatarenotablylesssmooth.
In contrast, while autonomous navigation is adept at identifying and following the shortest
possible path and generally succeeds in avoiding obstacles, it faces difficulties in more complex
scenarios, such as navigating around centrally located obstacles or dealing with sharp turns. In
these instances, autonomous systems may require extended periods to generate a feasible route or,
incertaincases,mightcausethe"freezingrobot"problem(TrautmanandKrause2010).
Our proposed SS-MPC-DCBF Local Planner merges the strengths of both autonomous and

DynamicExperiment
According to (Poddar et al. 2023), we create three different dynamic scenarios that the
robotic wheelchair may encounter in a crowded environment to test the performance under social
constraints. ThethreescenesareshowninFig.14andintroducedbelow:
• Crossing Experiment: Five pedestrians and the robot move between the corners of the
workspace. Pedestrians are instructed to navigate naturally with a normal walking speed.
In this case, the users and robot are reactive to each other and are able to avoid each other.
ThesetupisshowninFig.14a.
• Aggressive Experiment: One pedestrian and the robot switch each other’s position. In
this scenario, the robot will ignore the existence of the pedestrian and move to its goal
"aggressively". Therobotwillneedtogenerateacollision-freepathtoavoidcollidingwith
thepedestrian. ThisexperimentsetupisshowninFig.14c.
• DistractedExperiment: Onepedestrian,startingfromtheleftsideoftherobot,firstmoves
totherightsidebutquicklyshiftsbacktotheirinitialposition. Inthiscase,therobotneeds
to deal with the situation when the pedestrian suddenly changes their walking direction.
ThesetupisshowninFig.14e.
In order to simulate the obstacle avoidance and walking of real pedestrians, we use Reciprocal
Collision Avoidance (RVO2) (Li et al. 2019) as the pedestrian simulator in the created simulation
environment. We set the preferred speed for robots and pedestrians to be 1.2𝑚/𝑠, which is the
normalwalkingspeedforpeople(Montufaretal.2007).
To evaluate the performance of the proposed method in the dynamic social environment, we
compareourapproachwiththreebaselineapproaches:
• MPC (Turri et al. 2013): Autonomous linear MPC controller using simplified models and
31consideringdistanceconstraintswithvariousEuclideannorms.
• MPC-DCBF (Jian et al. 2022): Autonomous MPC tracking controller considering safe
constraintswithdiscretetimeDCBF.
• Socially-aware MPC (Poddar et al. 2023): Socially aware MPC controller considering
distanceaspedestrians’socialarea.
To evaluate the safety and efficiency of our Local Planner, we use “Min Dist”, “Time”, “Traj
Length”,“LinearVelVar”and“AngularVelVar”tocompareouralgorithmwiththethreebaseline
approaches. "Min Dist" represents the minimal distance between the robot and the pedestrians
throughout the whole navigation process. "Time" represents the time spent on the navigation
process. "TrajLength"representsthetrajectorylengththattherobottakestothegoal. "LinearVel
Var"and"AngularVelVar"representthelinearandangularvelocityvarianceduringthenavigation.
Iftherobotgeneratesawindingandlesssmoothpath,thelinearandangularvelocitiestendtohave

For each experiment, the trajectory generated by each algorithm is plotted in Fig. 14b, 14d
and14f. FromtheplotsandthequantitativeresultshowninTABLE3a,3band3c,wecanconclude
that our algorithm generates a most effective and smooth path compared to other three baseline
algorithms. The MPC algorithm cannot avoid dynamic obstacles due to the lack of prediction
or inaccurate prediction caused by sensor errors. The MPC-DCBF can successfully avoid the
dynamic obstacles in all three experiments. However, due to the limitation of the MPC-DCBF
in not incorporating the social spaces of both robots and pedestrians, the system, under scenarios
simulating distracted or aggressive behavior, generates paths that result in minimal distances to
pedestrians,causingpotentialsafetyrisks.
Forsocially-awareMPC,althoughitcangenerateapathwiththemaximumdistancebetweenthe
robot and the pedestrians, there are collisions in the aggressive experiment. Another downside for
socially-awareMPCisthatthepathgeneratedincrossingandaggressiveexperimentsislesssmooth
compared to other experiments, which is reflected in the linear and angular velocity variance. In
contrast, our proposed SS-MPC-DCBF Local Planner can smoothly and robustly avoid dynamic

LimitationsandFutureWork
Our insight is to use shared control to combine the advantages of autonomous navigation and
the user’s experience, yielding better performance than either alone. However, even though the
application of shared control is promising in improving trust and safety, the current input methods
andpreference-takingfromtheuser,whichrelyonclickingandtele-operation,candistracttheuser
during navigation in a crowded indoor environment, increasing collision risks. Another issue is
that although a real-world experiment was conducted in a tight indoor environment, with the lack
34of real-world robot data as well as the gap between simulation and real life, the performance of
the model is lower than the performance in simulation. Therefore, to replicate the success of the
simulation experiments on the real robot, more work on the parameter adjustment of the Local
Plannerwillbeneeded.

CONCLUSION
This paper introduced a new shared control-based dynamic navigation system for assistive
mobile robots, enhancing user interaction in indoor navigation scenarios. Drawing upon insights
frompreviousstudies,oursystemuniquelyincorporatesusers’pathpreferencesandcontrolinputs
into the navigation process. By separating the navigation system into a Global Planner for path
selection and a Local Planner for dynamic obstacle avoidance, we address critical limitations in
existing autonomous navigation approaches. Our Global Planner innovatively integrates adaptive
user path preferences into the path planning algorithm, ensuring the generation of a user-desired
collision-free path. This marks a significant step forward in personalizing assistive robotics,
enablinguserstoactivelyparticipateinthenavigationdecision-makingprocess.
Secondly, our system takes a step toward embedding social awareness within the robotic
navigation context. By incorporating social areas/spaces into the obstacle modeling process of
our Local Planner, our system ensures that respectful distances are maintained from pedestrians,
thereby enhancing the robot’s ability to navigate socially complex environments. This feature not
only improves the robot’s operational safety but also its social acceptability, a crucial aspect for
widespreadadoptioninreal-worldsettings.
