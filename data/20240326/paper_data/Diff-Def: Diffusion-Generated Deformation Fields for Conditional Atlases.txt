1 Introduction
Anatomical atlases –also called templates– represent an average anatomy of a
populationintheformofintensitytemplatesorprobabilisticmaps.Theyprovide
a common coordinate system for all images of a cohort and allow for an investi-

result, conditional atlases have been introduced to represent a sub-population
with specific characteristics (e.g. demographics such as age or sex).
Current approaches to create conditional atlases are either based on (a) it-
eratively registering images of a sub-group to a reference image or by (b) em-
ploying generative models that directly learn the atlas [10,12,20]. Usually, the
formeremploysdeformableregistration[30],wheresemanticregionsofanimage
of a cohort and a reference image are aligned and averaged [30]. These meth-
ods output a deformation field, which maps the image to the atlas and can
be further used to quantify anatomical variability and interpret the structural
changes. However, this conventional approach is time-consuming since, for each
condition, pairwise registration needs to be recomputed [16,31,8]. Conversely,
generative models paired with registration show promising results while being
faster during inference. However, some of them are greatly affected by training
instabilities,hallucinations,andtheregistrationquality,e.g.duetothechoiceof
an inadequate transformation model, potentially leading to low-quality atlases.
In this work, we propose to combine the best of both worlds. We formu-
late the task of conditional atlas construction as a deformation field generation
process using Diffusion Denoising Probabilistic Models (DDPM) [15]. The gen-
erateddeformationfieldisusedtotransformageneralpopulationatlasintoone
representing the sub-group, which is characterised by some desired attributes,
e.g. age or body mass index (BMI). To ensure a smooth, anatomically faithful
appearance, we constrain the conditional atlas to represent best the neighbour-
hood of images satisfying the attribute of interest. Additionally, by generating
a deformation field, the whole method is intrinsically interpretable. Our core
contributions can be summarised as follows:
1. We utilise diffusion models to generate an interpretable deformation field
which transforms a general population atlas into a conditional atlas.
2. We ensure the construction of a plausible atlas by minimising the distance
between the conditional atlas and a neighbourhood of images.
3. We demonstrate the utility of our method by generating brain atlases con-
ditioned on age and CSF volume as well as whole-body atlases of different
body compositions.

Atlas construction Atlas creation has been performed by iteratively register-
ing all cohort images to a reference image and averaging them [13]. However,
this process is time-consuming and leads to low-quality, blurry atlases that do
not capture the details of the underlying structural variability [5]. Furthermore,
the selection of a reference image introduces a morphological bias to the ap-
pearance of the atlas [22,33], requiring an additional unbiasing post-processing
step[16]–furtherincreasingtheoverallprocessingtime.Whengeneratingcondi-

correctness by minimising the distance to images that satisfy the condition.
More recently, generative methods have also become popular in the context
of atlas generation. They eliminate the additional unbiasing step by learning a
conditionalatlaswithoutexplicitlyaveragingalignedimages[10,12,20].Theyare
trained with either classic registration objectives [10] or generative adversarial
networks (GANs) [12]. Dalca et al. [10] propose a network that generates a
conditionaldiffeomorphic(differentiable,invertible,andsmooth)atlas.However,
the diffeomorphic transformation model may be inadequate, resulting in lower
qualityatlasesduetotheintricatenatureofhumananatomy,whichisoftennon-
smooth, e.g. when registering healthy to pathological images. To address this,
Dey et al. [12] propose a GAN-based model, combined with non-diffeomorphic
registration,thatsimultaneouslyminimisesaregistrationandanadversarialloss.
However,GANsarechallengingtodeployastheysufferfromtraininginstabilities
and mode collapse [3,14,21]. For these reasons, we leverage the capabilities of
diffusion models in this work.
Diffusion models Score-based diffusion models, and more specifically, denois-
ingdiffusionprobabilisticmodels(DDPMs)[15],haveshownremarkableperfor-
mance in generative modelling in various computer vision fields [9]. While they
are capable of yielding high-fidelity data, they also provide attractive properties
such as scalability and training tractability. Diffusion models have been used in
the medical imaging domain for tasks such as conditional synthetic brain gen-
eration [24], anomaly detection [7], and registration [18,25]. These methods are
able to generate an unprecedented level of realistic images but still suffer from
potential hallucinations. We propose to address this by generating deformation
fields instead of images. While [18,25] propose this in the context of pairwise
imageregistration,weintroducedeformationfieldsynthesisforconditionalatlas

3 Methods
ConditionalLatentDiffusionModels(LDMs) Ourproposedmethod(Fig-
ure 1) leverages the flexible and powerful conditional LDM [27] to generate
high-resolution 3D deformation vector fields (DVFs) that transform a general
population atlas to fit the conditioning characteristics. We first pre-train an au-
toencoder (AE) to learn a compressed latent representation z for each image,
where E , D describe the encoder and decoder of the AE, respectively. Next,
a a
we utilise a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) [15]. Here, in the
forward process, Gaussian noise N(0,1) is iteratively introduced to the latent
variablethroughafixedMarkovchain.Duringthereverseprocess,alsomodelled
as a Markov chain, the model processes Gaussian noise as well as a conditional
vector based on the attributes of the sub-population of interest.
Deformation synthesis module The desired conditional deformation field
is then synthesised by feeding the denoised latent vector z′ to a deformation

decoder D . Instead of following the typical approach of image generation with

to fine-tune the D to output a DVF (D ). This way, we retain meaningful cues

Morphology-preserving module The conditional deformation fields gener-
ated by the diffusion process allow us to flexibly deform a general population
atlas to align with the images that satisfy the feature of interest. To ensure the
generation of a smooth, geometrically plausible deformation field, we introduce
amorphology-preservingmodulebasedondeformableregistration.Everyepoch,
we randomly sample a neighbourhood of N images that satisfies the condition c
andutiliseapre-trainedregistrationmethod,Voxelmorph[6],toregistereachof
the neighbourhood’s images to the conditional atlas. This geometry-preserving
loss 1 is then calculated by minimising the average deformation of each neigh-
bouring image to the conditional atlas. Thus, this module pushes the generated
conditional atlas towards being the most representative point of the attribute-
specific neighbourhood and that its distance to each image is minimised. This is
described by the following morphology-preserving objective term:

segmented using FAST [36]. As conditions, we use the subjects’ age, ranging
from 50 to 80 years old and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volume normalised
by the total number of voxels, ranging from 0.0 to 0.6. As a general population

use 5000 whole-body MRI from the UK Biobank [32]. We process the stitched
[19] water contrast images with a resolution of (2.23×3×2.23) mm3 and size
(224×168×363) and downsample them by a factor of 2. As conditions, we
categorise BMI groups following [31]. As a general population atlas, we use two
of the available atlases for healthy males and females proposed by [31].
Implementation We implement the AE and the LDM following [27,24] us-
ing the publicly available repository [23]. To keep the memory requirements
tractable, we randomly sample a neighbourhood of 25 images that satisfy the
condition at every epoch. During the hyperparameter tuning process, the op-
timal results were attained by assigning equal weights to both the diffusion
and structure-preserving loss components and 0.5 for the regularisation term.
Implementation details regarding the AE, LDM, Voxelmorph, and the baseline
hyperparameters can be found in the appendix Table 3. We train all networks
on an A100 80GB GPU with Pytorch. The source code is publicly available5.

5 Results and Discussion
The optimal conditional atlas should minimise the distance to every subject
that satisfies the condition without deviating from the dataset appearance in
the intensity domain. We measure this with metrics quantifying similarities in
appearance, structural properties, and centrality.

we achieve sharper boundaries while maintaining the intensity distribution of
the dataset and the overall brain shape. Since our method deforms an exist-
ing population atlas with the generated deformation field, it does not introduce
any hallucinations or unrealistic intensities, e.g. darker ventricles. On the other
hand, GAN and LDM are prone to generate unrealistic intensities and noisy
backgrounds,requiringfurtherpost-processingandbrainshapes.Atrophyofthe

compared to GAN and LDM without a post-processing denoising step.

we showcase qualitative results of generated whole-body atlases. In this case,
the female overweight atlas (4c) is generated by applying the deformation field
conditioned on BMI (4d) to a healthy BMI atlas (4b). We demonstrate how the
deformation field can be used to localise the increase in subcutaneous fat (red
segmentation mask), resulting in a generated overweight atlas, which is very
similar to the conventionally created one (4a).
6 Conclusion
Atlases generated with conventional methods are well-established due to their
reliability and realism. They, however, face scalability issues in terms of speed,
data, and memory requirements, which renders them difficult to use with sub-
population conditioning. Others have used generative modelling to synthesise
conditionalatlases,whichisfasterandnotasdependentonthefeatureselection
but this comes with other limitations such as training instabilities and mode
collapse [21]. In this work, we propose to combine the highly interpretable de-
formationvectorfieldfromtheconventionalmethodsandthepowerofdiffusion
models to generate deformation fields to transform an existing population atlas
into conditioned ones. Our proposed method outperforms previous approaches
in terms of structural and perceptual aspects. However, our method is depen-
dentontheinputpopulationatlas.Inthecaseofthebrain,thisposesaminimal
issue as there are plenty of general atlases available. Nevertheless, in the case of
whole-body, atlas definition and construction are more challenging due to the
high anatomical variability. Another challenge is that our method requires longDiffusion-Generated Deformation Fields for Conditional Atlases 9
training. Conversely, it can generate conditional atlases in seconds. Finally, it
is not tailored to a specific image modality; one could learn to generate an at-
las on a T1-weighted dataset and seamlessly extend it to another modality, e.g.
T2-weighted.
