DPAR:aData-drivenPAsswordRecommendationsystembasedonadatasetof905millionleaked
passwords. DPAR generates password recommendations by analyzing the user’s given password
and suggesting specific tweaks that would make it stronger while still keeping it memorable and
similartotheoriginalpassword. Weconductedtwostudiestoevaluateourapproach: verifyingthe
memorability of generated passwords (n = 317), and evaluating the strength and recall of DPAR
recommendationsagainstpasswordmeters(n = 441). Inarandomizedexperiment, weshowthat

We discuss our findings and their implications for enhancing password management with recom-
mendationsystems.
1 Introduction
Passwordsarecurrentlythemostwidelyusedmethodforauthenticationtodigitalservices[22]. Despitetheirmany
limitations, They are extensively used for protecting sensitive information across numerous services, including web
services, online banking, social media, and organizational IT access. Creating robust passwords is essential to the
safeguarding of these services. According to industry studies, nearly half of data breaches involved authentication
failures [65, 33]. Passwords remain vulnerable because people tend to choose easy-to-remember passwords, which
are also commonly used [54], and tend to reuse the same password in different services [70]. Adversaries then
exploitthesepatternstocraftattacksonsystemsandindividualaccounts[55,15,8,64]. Whiletheuseofpassword
managers is increasing, users eschew generated passwords because system-generated passwords are challenging to
enterandrememberwhenthemanagerisunavailable[46,42].Duetotheirflexibility,simplicity,andwidedeployment,
passwordsarestillthepreferredmethodofauthenticationbyusers[81]. Therefore,thisstudyismotivatedbytheneed

Organizations use two primary types of interventions to encourage stronger passwords during password creation:

2 Background
2.1 Passwordpolicies
Typical password policies are designed to make users’ passwords more difficult to predict by imposing strict guide-
lines on the password content. Policies appear in many incarnations: some sites require digits, others require the
presenceofatleastthreecharacterclasses,somebanishcertainsymbols,andmostsetvaryinglengthminimumsand
maximums [5, 67, 19]. A common approach is the LUDS approach, which stands for Lowercase Uppercase Digits
SpecialCharacters,detailinghowmanyoftheseclassesshouldappearinthepassword[72].
Password policies often pose cognitive burdens on users, which make it harder to create and memorize a password
[34]. Thetensionbetweenpasswordsecurityandusabilitycreatescompetingchallengesthatinfluencehowpasswords
arecreatedandused[69]. Therefore,userstendtoemploysimpleheuristicstocopewiththedemandsofthepolicy,
suchasaddingspecialcharactersattheendofthepassword[62].Theseheuristicsmightparadoxicallyresultinweaker
passwordsbecauseoftheirregularity[38,26],reducingthebarrierforcyberattacks.
2.2 Nudgingusers
Nudging approaches do not explicitly impose strict policies on users but rather reflect the concept of nudging in
behavioral economics to help users make better decisions when creating passwords. Renaud and Zimmerman [52]
found that a simple textual feedback nudge did not significantly impact password strength. However, adding an
incentiveintheformofamoreextendedexpirationdateforastrongerpasswordresultedinmorerobustpasswords.

Password meters are a common form of nudging in which the users are presented with information about the pass-
word’s strength [82]. Password meters often extend the LUDS approach by including dictionaries, considering l33t
speaktransformations,keyboardwalks,andotherheuristics[72,25].Uretal.developedadata-drivenpasswordmeter

[24, 28, 47] or Markov Models [7, 16, 71]. Neural networks provide a robust way to measure password strength,

The PESrank model [12] is based on the observation that when people create a password, they often modify a base
word by applying various transformations such as adding a prefix and/or a suffix of digits and symbols before or
after the base word, capitalizing some letters of the base word, or substituting letters with visually similar digits
or symbols using “l33t” translations. PESrank models the probability distributions of these classes (dimensions) of
transformationsbasedonamassivedatasetof905millionleakedpasswords.
While analyzing the strength of a password is a relatively straightforward task, given a threat model, understanding

Memorability is, therefore, considered the most crucial aspect of password usability. How can we measure mem-
orability? That depends on the usage scenario. Mukherjee et al. [45] developed a model for generating memorable

passwordsfromscratchbasedonpassphrases[76].Levenshteindistance,alsoknownaseditdistance,wasusedinsev-
eralpassword-relatedscenarios,includingmeasuringtheimpactofprivacypoliciesandmetersonmodifiedpasswords
[66], determining the similarity between a given password and a dictionary word [31], or measuring the similarity
betweenacorrectandincorrectpasswordduringarecallexercise [40]. However, itisyetunclearwhethertheLev-
enshtein distance could serve as a viable approach for generating a usable suggestion based on the user’s original
password.
2.4 Passwordcreationsystems
Inreviewingtheexistingliterature,weidentifiedtwocommonstrategiesforpasswordcreationmechanisms. Thefirst
involvessystem-generatedpasswords,whilethesecondacceptsaninitialuser-providedpasswordandstrengthensit.
In Table 3 in the Appendix we summarize the similarities and differences between DPAR and the aforementioned
approaches.
System-generated passwords suggest completely new passwords to users and are used in password managers and
browsers. Forexample,Yangetal.[77]conductedanevaluationofvariousmodelsthatgeneratepasswordsforusers,
specificallyfocusingonthosethatemploymnemonicstrategies. Thestudyilluminatestheadvantagesofmnemonic-
basedpasswordgenerationmethodswhilealsoprovidingacomparativeanalysisofthesestrategiesintermsoftheir

whichgeneratescomputer-basedpasswordswhilepermittinguserstomodifycertaincharacterstoenhancememorabil-
ity. However,theirlaboratorystudiesrevealedatrade-off: anincreaseincharactermodificationsimprovedpassword
recallbutsimultaneouslydecreasedsecuritylevels,asthesepasswordsweremoresusceptibletocracking. Mukherjee
et al. [45] introduced the “MASCARA” model, aimed at enhancing the recall rate of system-generated passphrases.
Byassessingthecharactererrorrate(CER)ofanextensivepassphrasedataset,theauthorsidentifiedthreestatistically
significant signals correlated with memorability. This enabled them to compute the recall rate of passphrases and
modifythemforimprovedmemorability,albeitwithapotentialreductioninsecurity.
Forget et al. [20] introduced the concept of Persuasive Text Passwords (PTP) as a way to encourage users to create
passwordsthatarebothmoresecureandusable. Thissystemfunctionsbyacceptingapasswordinputfromtheuser,
andthenrandomlyinjectingadditionalcharactersintotheoriginalpasswordtoenhanceitsstrength. Usersmayselect
the modified password or to further inject random characters into their original choice. The system was evaluated
only in a small-scale lab experiment. Ur et al. [59] developed a data-driven password meter (hereafter referred to
as the “CUPS password meter”) that uses a neural network model to assess password strength. It not only provides
textualfeedbackbutalsoadjuststheoriginalpasswordbyofferingsuggestionsforenhancement. Thesesuggestions
andfeedbackarederivedfrompasswordpolicies. ThisapproachbearstheclosestresemblancetoDPAR.
Breaking up with the interaction model of password meters, DPAR gives users several password suggestions, mim-
icking the interaction of classic recommendation systems [27]. This seemingly subtle change in the user interface

3.1 Passwordstrengthmodeling
InthedesignofDPAR,wehaveemployedthePESrankmodel[12]toanalyzeeachpasswordcomponent’sstrengthand
thecompletepassword’sstrengthbasedona-priorianalysisof905millionleakedpasswords. Aspartofthepassword
strength estimation process, a given password is divided into five components (dimensions). If the password begins
orendswithasequenceofsymbolsanddigits,thebeginningsequenceisseparatedfromthepasswordandidentified
as the prefix. Similarly, the ending digit/symbol sequence is identified as the suffix. The remaining middle part is
themutatedbaseword,whichallowsfortwomutations: specificletterscantransformsymbolsordigitsthatresemble
them (l33t transformations), and lowercase letters can be capitalized. The capitalization pattern and combination of
l33ttransformationsaredimensions3and4. PESrank’sbaseword(afterconvertingtolowercaseandundoingl33t
transformations)isthe5thdimension.Forinstance,thepassword“!1P@ssw0rD2#”hasaprefix(“!1”),asuffix(“2#”),
abaseword(“password”),al33tlist[“@”,“0”],andacapitalizationpattern[0,-1].
Empirical data shows that this 5-dimension decomposition is very well aligned with statistics observed in leaked

with digits/symbols and 8.95% start with digits/symbols—i.e., have a non-empty suffix or prefix. Moreover, 7.66%
use capital letters and 9.86% use l33t transformations. Finally, while the PESrank model has special case handling

3.2 PasswordEnhancement
TheDPARpasswordenhancementprocessstartswithauser-selectedpassword. Theuser’sinputisdividedintofive
dimensions, as explained above. We treat each dimension specifically. We create a list of per-dimension random

Apasswordprefix(orsuffix)canbeanystringcomposedof10digitsand32keyboardsymbols. Ourfunction(Gen-
eratePrefixSuffixinAlgorithm1intheAppendix)alwaysreturnsthreechoicesforamodifiedprefix/suffix. Itdistin-
guishes between an empty prefix/suffix: the user did not use digits or symbols in the password’s beginning (or the
end), and a non-empty one. If the original prefix (or suffix) is empty GeneratePrefixSuffix produces three random
digit/symbolstringsoflengths1,2,3,respectively. Iftheoriginalprefix/suffixstrisnotempty,wedistinguishbetween
thefollowingscenarios:

2. Ifstristwocharacterslong,werandomlyreplaceonecharacterortheothercharacter,andwerandomlyadd
onedigitorsymbol,producing2stringsoflength2andoneoflength3.
3. If str is three or more characters long , we randomly select and replace a character three times, producing
threemodificationsandastringofoflength3ormore.
Ultimately, we end up with three sets of prefixes/suffixes that were either replaced or created. We repeat this step
4 times and end up with an array of 12 modified prefixes/suffixes. Note that we only insert between 1-3 changes
each time. We do this to control the number of tweaks. Lastly, we add the original prefix (or suffix) to the list of
recommendationsforatotalof13optionsforeachdimension.
L33t transformations (replacing letters by digits and symbols that are visually similar) were observed by [72] and
shown to be commonly used by [12]. We used the 14 l33t transformations from Table 2 in [12]. The l33t rank
improvement function (GenerateL33t in Algorithm 1) receives the base word and returns one random possible l33t
transformation,i.e.,whenoneofalistof11lowercaseletters[a,e,i,o,s,x,o,p,z,t,g]islocatedinthebaseword

password and at least one modification made by DPAR. Some recommendations in the dataset are modified only
in one dimension (prefix, suffix, l33t, capitalization), while others are modified in multiple positions in multiple
dimensions. For instance, if the base password of the user was “amsterdam”, a valid DPAR recommendation could
be “am5terDam&#”, in which the user’s original choice is modified in 4 positions (“**5***D**&#”) spanning 3
dimensions(l33t,capitalization,andsuffix).

3.3 UserExperience
As illustrated in Figure 1, our user interface consists of three screens: the initial landing screen, the feedback and
recommendationselectionscreen,andthespecificrecommendationscreen.
Theinitial landingscreenisdivided intotwosections. Oursystem instructsuserstocreate apasswordwithat least
eightcharacters,oneletter,andonedigit,mimickingabasicpasswordcomplexitypolicy. Aftertheuserhasentered
the password, DPAR presents textual feedback based on the password strength, and optionally also three buttons
representing our recommendations. The feedback and its text color are determined by the password strength (PS)
calculated by the PESrank model. Passwords with 0 < PS ≤ 29 bits receive the textual feedback “weak” colored
inred,thosewith29 < PS ≤ 37bitsreceivethetextualfeedback“fair”coloredinyellow,andthosePS > 37bits
receivethetextualfeedback“strong”coloredingreen. Forinstance,“Yourpasswordisweak”,whenthewordweak
iscoloredinred,asdepictedinFigure1.
We also estimated how long it would take an attacker to guess the password and placed the color-coded estimate in
thefeedback. Thecolorcodingofthetimeestimatesisalignedwiththe“weak/fair/strong”categorizationdescribed
above; namely, if the password is found to be “weak”, the user interface displays the text “Hackers may guess your
passwordwithin4minutes”, where“4minutes”iscoloredinred. Weestimatedthetime(denotedasT)itwilltake

OurprimaryuserstudyevaluatedtheDPARsysteminascenarioresemblingareal-worldpasswordcreationprocess.
We have employed a standard design in password usability studies, similar to several other studies [36, 53, 59]: we
created an online study and invited users to register to our online system, guiding them to imagine registering to an
important account such as an online banking application or a healthcare account: see the presented instructions in
Figure8intheappendix.
5.1 Methodology
WerecruitedparticipantsfromAmazon’sMechanicalTurkcrowdsourcingserviceintheU.S.. Toparticipate,individ-
uals had to be at least 18 years old, have a Hit approval rate (%) greater than 98 for all participants’ hits, and have

whichis$0.60forcompletingStage1and$0.40forStage2. TheInstitutionalEthicsCommitteeapprovedthestudy.
Thestudywasdividedintotwostages: (1)creatingapasswordbyregisteringtooursystemand(2)measuringpass-

domlyassignedtoapasswordrecommendationfeedbackvariant. Stage2occurredatleast48hoursafterStage1and
includedapasswordrecalltaskandquestionnaire.
Wesetanupperboundofpasswordstrength: Participantswhoseinitialpasswordstrengthwasverystrong(exceeded
54 bits) were automatically allocated to the “feedback only” group since tweaking such passwords typically yields
marginalstrengthimprovements. Inthequestionnaires,weobservedthatuserswithstronginitialpasswordstypically
used a password generator. Note that the CUPS Password Meter [49] has similar behavior. To distinguish between
them and the original feedback-only group, they were assigned to group number 5. No lower bound of password
strengthwasset.
Stage 1 Participants were instructed to create a password for a significant account carrying sensitive information.
After creating a username and password, they received feedback on the password strength and a recommendation
basedontheirassignedcondition(seebelow). Participantscouldchoosetoregisterwithoutchangingtheirpassword

identical to the Stage 1 “recall” step: Participants needed to remember their password and username and were then

Participants assigned to the feedback+recommendations conditions could press any of the three buttons and were
shown the recommendation details as in Figure 1 (right side). The buttons were ordered according to the number
of changes, from the smallest to the largest. They could inject the password into the form by pressing the ‘use the

Theapplicationwasdesignedtobecompatiblewithbothdesktopandmobiledisplays. Wechosenottodisableany
browser features, such as password managers or password storage, to prevent impacting the participants’ browsers.
This approach also ensured that we did not provide specific guidance that could influence the password creation
process.
Survey Demographic questions were asked, followed by questions on password creation aids and recall methods.
Participantswereaskedabouttheirexperiencesduringtheregistrationprocessandtorespondona5-pointscalewith
questions about the process. They were also asked to share their thoughts and feelings about the process and our
recommendations. The questionnaire was adapted to be compatible with both desktop and mobile displays. The

For those who reported the password was difficult to remember, we found two main types of explanations: (i) the
password was too long, and (ii) the password contained digits or symbols which the users were not accustomed to.
Typical feedback was, for instance, “It was difficult to remember because it added random letters and symbols to
my password”, and “The password was difficult to remember since I had never used it before and the addition of

6 Discussion
Inthispaper,wedescribedthedesignandevaluationofDPAR,aData-drivenPasswordRecommendationsystemthat
helpsuserspickupstrongerpasswordswhilebeingabletorecallthem. WefoundthatuserswhohadusedDPAR’s
password recommendations had ended up with stronger passwords without significantly impacting their ability to
recall the passwords. This may suggest that minor modifications to a password that the user initially chose can be
recalled similarly to passwords that the user modified. DPAR differs significantly from the approach adopted by
passwordmeters[25,59,20],asitsparesuserstheneedtonavigatethecomplexitiesofpasswordsecurityguidelines
orbestpractices.
Our user study points to several promising aspects of using recommendation systems in the domain of passwords.
DPARrecommendationswerechosenby36.6%oftheparticipantsintheuserstudy,comparedtoonly7%ofthepar-
ticipantsthatadoptedthesuggestionsoftheCUPSpasswordmeterasreportedin[59]. Mostparticipantswhoviewed
DPAR’srecommendationschosetheslightestpossiblechangeovertheiroriginalpasswordandtheotherrecommen-
dations. Thismayindicatethatusersprefertomakeasfewchangesaspossible.
Our findings also point to further complexities that interface designers must face when designing password recom-
mendationsystems. Forexample,usersarebiasedtowardclickingontheupperbutton,eveniftheorderofthebuttons
israndomized. Thisphenomenonisaclassicexampleofpositioneffects,wheretheprobabilityofclinkingonabutton
isinfluencedbyitsposition[10]. Eachrecommendationbuttonrepresentsatrade-offbetweensecurityandusability,
or in behavioral economics terms, a trade-off between cost and benefit; when presented with three recommendation
buttons,theupperbuttonisthemostimmediatetofind,andit,therefore,representshigherusabilityandlowersecu-
rity,thebottombuttonrepresentshighersecurityandlowerusability,andtheoneinthemiddlerepresentsintermediate
usabilityandsecurity. Thus,wespeculatedthatmostuserswouldchoosethemiddlegroundofusabilityandsecurity
in the cost and benefit [2]—and this was not the case. We found that most users preferred usability over security.
Thiscanemphasizethelackofunderstandingofsecurity,orperhapsusersdon’tseealotofbenefitinsecurity,thus
favoringusability.
Our findings point to new ways to improve password creation processes. Passwords remain important despite their
shortcomings. Thereisongoingdebateregardingpasswords’continuedrelevanceinthefaceofthegrowingadoption
ofalternativeauthenticationsolutions[3],andthedeclarationofthedeathofpasswordsseemspremature[50,30,81].
However,theusefulnessofpasswordsremainshigh. Laboratorystudieshaveshownthatusershighlyratepasswords
regarding preference, usability, and intention to use, and lowest in terms of expected problems and effort [81, 6].
At the same time, while password managers and biometric authentications are becoming more prevalent, they still
requirepasswordsasabackupmethod. Therefore,wearguethattheneedtohelpuserscreatemorerobustandbetter

6.1 Limitations
When considering the generalizability of our findings, it is essential to understand several limitations of our study.
First, we should be aware of some limitations to the usage of m-turk in online studies [57]. In the DPAR study, we
redirected users to an external application, asking them to complete registration to a website. We also conducted
variousteststoensurethequalityofourdata. Second,theparticipantsinthisstudywereaskedtocreateapassword,
butunlikeareal-lifescenariowheretheywouldprotectavaluableasset,theywerenottaskedwithsecuringanactual

To assess the overall contribution of our approach compared to password meters, we note that the mean strength of

the risk is not different than the risk imposed by existing password management systems [58], adding another layer

Existing works on similar problems may point to possible directions. For example, Emmadi et al. implemented a

7 Conclusions
Our study provides a crucial first step in building and implementing password recommendation systems. We have
shown that recommendations can add an effective interaction for helping people create stronger passwords while
preservingsimilarrecalltopasswordmeters.Wehopeourmethodcanopennewavenuesforworkinmakingpassword
