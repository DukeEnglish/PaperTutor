In this section, to illustrate the validity of the proposed
detection based distributed resilient protocolfor optimization,
we examine a scenario involving eight heterogeneous mobile (8, 7)
robots tasked with an optimal assembly problem. (8, 6)
Initially, the communication topology is depicted as shown (8, 3)
in Fig. 2 (b), wherein agents 1 and 2 are identified as the (7, 6)
Byzantine robots capable of distorting their true information (7, 5)
when communicating with their neighbors. The system dy- (6, 5)
