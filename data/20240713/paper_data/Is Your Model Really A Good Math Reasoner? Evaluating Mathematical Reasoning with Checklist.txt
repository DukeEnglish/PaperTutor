2.1 TaskGeneralization
Testing models across different tasks on the same domain not only offers a comprehensive and
profoundevaluationoftheircapabilities[19]butalsocaterstothepracticaldemandsandcomplexities
ofreal-worldapplications[25]. InMATHCHECK,weincorporatefourmathtasksincludingProblem
Solving,AnswerableJudging,OutcomeJudging,andProcessJudging.
ProblemSolving. Inthistask,weaskthemodelstosolveagivenmathproblem. Asthemostwidely
usedmethodtotestmathematicalreasoningabilityincontemporaryresearch[15;22],itnecessitates
themodeltoanalyzetheproblem,recallandapplyappropriatemathknowledge,andfinallyconclude

Answerable Judging. Given a math problem, models need to determine whether the problem
providessufficientinformationtoanswerthequestion. Thistaskrequiresthemodeltoanalyzethe

whethertheseconditionsareprovidedwithintheproblemstatement. Previousworksutilizeditto

ProblemUnderstanding. Itreferstotransformingtheoriginalproblemintoanewonethatuses
different wording or different sentence structures but does not change the mathematical logic of

whichconditionsarenecessaryandwhichareirrelevanttotheproblem.
Scenario Understanding. When models comprehend the scenario of a math problem and its
underlying logic, they should be able to solve other questions within that scenario [34; 65; 73].
Therefore, we alter the original question to evaluate whether the models have a comprehensive
understandingofthescenario. Forexample,asshowninFigure1,weaskthequestion“thenumber
ofbluebolts"insteadof“thenumberoftotalbolts".

3.4 MathCheckRepresentsMathematicalIntelligenceMoreLinearly
One desiderata of a good mathematical benchmark is to reflect real mathematical intelligence
perfectly. Wefollowpreviousworks[67;23]toassess“intelligence"frompracticalstandpointsand
useperformanceonprivatedata[67]andcompressionefficiency[18;23]assurrogatestoassessthe
genuinemathematicalabilitiesofmodels. ByexaminingthecorrelationbetweenMATHCHECKand
thesesurrogates,wecanverifywhetherourdesigneffectivelyreflectsmathematicalintelligence,and
howitcomparestotraditionalbenchmarks.
CorrelationwithPrivateData. Unliketraditionalopen-sourcedbenchmarks,privatedataisless
likely to be contaminated or overfitted, making it an appropriate proxy of genuine mathematical
intelligence. We adopt GSM1k [67], a new private GSM8k-level dataset, to measure the real
mathematical reasoning of models. We compare the correlation of model performance between
GSM1k and MATHCHECK-GSM/GSM8K. As shown in Figure 3, the left part illustrates the
correlationbetweenGSM8kandGSM1k. ItrevealsthatmostLLMsachievescoresupto80%on
GSM8k, with scores concentrated in the top half of the graph. However, on GSM1k, the scores
are evenly distributed, indicating that some LLMs, such as deepseek-math-7B-RL, have inflated
scoresonGSM8k. ThissuggeststhattheGSM8kscoreisnotareliablebenchmarkforassessingthe
truemathematicalreasoningabilityofthemodels. Intherightsub-figure,MATHCHECK-GSMand
GSM1kdisplayagoodpositivecorrelation,andsomemodelsthatdonotperformwellonGSM1k
canbedetectedbyMATHCHECK-GSM.BycomparingthePearsoncorrelationcoefficientandthe
rootmeansquareerror,itshowsthatMATHCHECKhasahighercorrelationcoefficientwithGSM1k,
mitigatingbiasevaluationcausedbyoverfittinganddatacontamination.
CorrelationwithCompressionEfficiency. Compressionefficiencyhasbeenempiricallyproven
thatrepresentintelligencewell[18]evenlinearly[23],wellalignedwiththebeliefthatcompression
iscloselyconnectedtointelligence[16]. Following[23],weuseBPC-LossinArxivpaperstagged
with “Math" to measure compression efficiency as a surrogate. Figure 4 shows the correlation
betweenBPC-LossandGSM8K/MathCheck-GSM.Theleftsub-figurerevealsthatasingletraditional
benchmarklikeGSM8Kcannotadequatelyreflectgenuinemathematicalability,asindicatedbythe
lowPearsoncorrelationcoefficient(p=−0.822). Manymodels,suchastheQwenseries,deviate
significantlyfromtheregressionline. Incontrast,therightsub-figuredisplaysthecorrelationwith
our MATHCHECK-GSM, demonstrating that MATHCHECK-GSM exhibits a significantly better
correlationwithgenuineintelligence, withaPearsoncorrelationcoefficientofp = −0.915. Our
methodshowsthatmanymodels,suchastheQwenseries,havescoresonourbenchmarkthatalign
more accurately with their true mathematical abilities. This shows that our design can represent
mathematicalintelligencemorelinearlycomparedtotraditionalbenchmarks.

BenchmarksofTextualMathematicalReasoning. Numerousbenchmarkshavebeenproposed
to evaluate the mathematical reasoning capabilities of AI models, including [4; 15; 20]. Some
datasets,suchastheelementary-levelGSM8k[15],exhibitphenomenaofperformancesaturation
ordatacontamination. Consequently,morechallengingdatasetshavebeenintroduced,including
thoseatthehigh-schoollevel[22],anduniversitylevel [50;70]. Additionally,toprovideamore
comprehensiveassessmentofmodels’mathematicalreasoningabilities,numerousbenchmarkshave
beendevelopedthatmeasuretherobustnessofmathematicalreasoningthroughvariousmeans[29],
including semantic perturbations [59; 74], reverse problem-solving [65; 8], and the presence of
irrelevant contextual distractions [52; 30]. Distinct from the aforementioned benchmarks, which

BenchmarksofVisualMathematicalReasoning. Recently,multi-modallargelanguagemodels,
particularly large vision-language models, have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in visual-
language reasoning tasks [3; 13; 64; 57]. A bunch of benchmarks [31; 6; 24; 39; 42] have been
introducedtoassessthevisualreasoningcapabilitiesofmulti-modallargelanguagemodelsacross
variousmodalitiesincludingabstractscenes,geometricdiagrams,graphics,andcharts[36;11;10;

Follow the given examples and give your judgment.
Question: Leah had 32 chocolates and her sister had 42. If they ate
35, how many pieces do they have left in total?
Solution: Step 1: Originally, Leah had 32 chocolates.
Step 2: Her sister had 42. So in total they had 32 + 42 = 74.
Step 3: After eating 35, they had 74 - 35 = 39.
The answer is 39.
Judgment: Step 1 and Step 2 accurately calculate the total number of
chocolates they both had originally.
Step 3 correctly calculates how many they have left after eating 35
chocolates.
The answer is: Correct.
Question: Jason had 20 lollipops. He gave Denny some lollipops. Now
Jason has 12 lollipops. How many lollipops did Jason give to Denny?
Solution: Step 1: Jason started with 20 lollipops.
Step2: Then he had 12 after giving some to Denny.
Step3: So he gave Denny 20 + 12 = 8.
The answer is 32.
Judgment: Jason ended up with 12 lollipops after giving some to Denny,
having started with 20. Therefore, the calculation to find out how
many lollipops Jason gave to Denny should be:20 - 12 = 8.

[Question]: Mike plays ping pong for 40 minutes. In the first 20
minutes, he scores 4 points. In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25%
more points. How many total points did he score?
[Solution]:
Step 1: Find the number of points Mike scored in the second 20 minutes
. To do this, take the number of points he scored in the first 20
minutes, which is 4 points, and increase this by 25%.
Step 2: To calculate 25% of 4, divide 4 by 4 which gives 1 (since 25%
is the same as 1/4th).
Step 3: Add this 25% (which is 1 point) to the original 4 points to
find out how many points he scored in the second 20 minutes. So, 4
points + 1 point = 5 points.
Step 4: Now, to find the total number of points Mike scored in the 40
minutes, add the points scored in the first 20 minutes to the points
scored in the second 20 minutes.
24So, 4 points (first 20 minutes) + 5 points (second 20 minutes) = 9
points.

[Solution]:
Step 1: Define the given information: Mike plays ping pong for 40
minutes, scores x points in the first 20 minutes, and scores 25% more
points in the second 20 minutes.
Step 2: Since he scores 25% more points in the second 20 minutes, we

[Question]: As shown in the figure, the diameter CD of \\odot O
crosses the midpoint G of chord EF, \\angle DCF = 20.0, then \\angle
EOD is equal to ()\\degree
[Solution]:
Step 1: Identify that the angle DCF is an angle formed by a chord (CF)
and a tangent (CD) at the point C.
Step 2: Recognize that the angle between a chord and a tangent at the
point of contact is equal to the angle in the alternate segment, which
is angle ECF in this case.
Step 3: Thus, the measure of angle ECF is also 20 degrees.
Step 4: Observe that the diameter CD passes through the center O of
the circle and cuts the chord EF at its midpoint G.
Step 5: Recall that a line drawn from the center of the circle to the
midpoint of a chord is perpendicular to the chord.
Step 6: Therefore, triangle EOG is a right-angled triangle at G.
Step 7: Understand that angle EOD is double the angle ECF because
angle EOD is the angle at the center whereas angle ECF is at the
circumference based on the Circle Theorem.
Step 8: Calculate angle EOD as 2 times angle ECF, which is 2 * 20
degrees.
Step 9: Perform the multiplication: 2 * 20 degrees = 40 degrees.
The answer is: Angle EOD measures 40 degrees.

[Question]: As shown in the figure, the diameter CD of \\odot O
crosses the midpoint G of chord EF, \\angle DCF = 20.0, then \\angle
EOD is equal to ()\\degree
[Solution]:
Step 1: Notice that chord EF is bisected by diameter CD at point G.
Step 2: Recognize that \\angle DCF is an angle formed by the diameter
CD and chord EF, so it is inscribed in the semicircle of \\odot O.
Step 3: Recall that an angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right
angle; hence \\angle DCF = 90\\degree (not the given 20\\degree, which
seems to be a mistake).
Step 4: Realize that \\angle EOD is the angle at the center of the
circle, and it stands on the arc EF.
Step 5: Understand that the angle at the center of a circle is twice
the angle at the circumference when both stand on the same arc.
30Step 6: Since \\angle DCF is a right angle (90\\degree) and \\angle
EOD is twice that angle at the center, \\angle EOD is 2 * 90\\degree.
Step 7: Calculate 2 * 90\\degree to get 180\\degree.
The answer is \\angle EOD is equal to 180\\degree.

[Question]: In the circle with center O, diameter CD intersects the
midpoint G of the chord EF, and the measure of angle DCF is 20 degrees
. Determine the measurement of angle EOD in degrees.
[Solution]:
Step 1: Identify that chord EF is intersected at its midpoint G by the
diameter CD; this implies that triangle CGF is isosceles with CG = GF
.
Step 2: Recognize that angle DCF is given as 20 degrees and that angle
DGF is also 20 degrees because CGF is an isosceles triangle and angle
CGF equals angle DGF.
Step 3: Realize that angle EOF is twice angle DGF since angle EOF is
the angle subtended at the center by chord EF, and angle DGF is the
angle subtended at the circumference by the same chord (the Angle at
the Center Theorem).
Step 4: Calculate angle EOF as 2 * angle DGF which is 2 * 20 degrees =
40 degrees.
Step 5: Note that angle EOD is twice angle EOF because EO is a
diameter of the circle, and therefore angle EOD subtends a semicircle,
making it a straight angle or 180 degrees.
Step 6: Divide 180 degrees by the angle EOF to find angle EOD. Since
EOF is 40 degrees, angle EOD is 180 degrees / 40 degrees = 4.5 times
EOF.
Step 7: Determine that there is a mistake in the previous step: angle
EOF is part of angle EOD and not the other way around. Therefore,
angle EOD consists of two EOF angles plus the straight angle DOF,
which is 180 degrees.
Step 8: Sum up the angles to find angle EOD: angle EOF (40 degrees) +
angle DOF (180 degrees) + angle EOF (40 degrees) which is 40 + 180 +
40.
31Step 9: Add the angles to get the measurement of angle EOD: 40 + 180 +
40 = 260 degrees.
The answer is 260 degrees.

[Question]: In the figure of circle O, the diameter CD intersects the
midpoint G of the chord EF. The length of the chord EF is 7.5 cm,
which is irrelevant to our angle measurements. The angle \\angle DCF
is given to be 20.0 degrees. We need to calculate the angle \\angle
EOD. What is the measure of this angle in degrees?
[Solution]:
Step 1: Recognize that \\angle DCF is an angle formed by intersecting
a chord (EF) and a diameter (CD) of the circle.
Step 2: Acknowledge that an angle formed by a chord and a tangent (or
in this case a diameter) at the point of contact is equal to the angle
in the alternate segment, which means \\angle DCF is equal to angle
\\angle EOF.
Step 3: Consider that CD is a diameter, so triangle COD is an
isosceles triangle with CO = OD (both are radii of the circle).
Step 4: Recall that the base angles in an isosceles triangle are equal
, which means \\angle CDO = \\angle DCO.\nStep 5: Since \\angle CDF is
given as 20.0 degrees and \\angle CDO = \\angle DCO, each of these
angles is also 20.0 degrees.
Step 6: Understand that \\angle EOD is the sum of \\angle EOF and \\
angle FOD (since \\angle EOF and \\angle FOD are adjacent angles).
Step 7: Since \\angle EOF is equal to \\angle DCF, which is 20.0
degrees, then \\angle EOF is also 20.0 degrees.
Step 8: Calculate the measure of \\angle EOD by adding the measures of
\\angle EOF and \\angle FOD, which are both 20.0 degrees.
Step 9: Perform the calculation: \\angle EOD = \\angle EOF + \\angle
FOD = 20.0 degrees + 20.0 degrees.
Step 10: Conclude that \\angle EOD measures 40.0 degrees.
The answer is 40.0 degrees.

[Question]: As shown in the figure, the diameter CD of \\odot O
crosses the midpoint G of chord EF, \\angle DCF = x , \\angle EOD is
equal to 40\\degree. What is the value of unknown variable x?
32[Solution]:
Step 1: Recognize that diameter CD of circle O passes through the
center of the circle (point O) and bisects chord EF at point G.
Step 2: Since CD is a diameter, it creates a semicircle from E to F
passing through C.
Step 3: Recognize that \\angle EOD is the angle subtended by the
diameter and thus is a right angle (90\\degree) because it is an angle
in a semicircle.
Step 4: Understand that triangle EOD is a right triangle with \\angle
EOD being 90\\degree and \\angle EOF being half of \\angle EOD because
O is the center of the circle and EOF is half of the circle (an arc
of 180\\degree).
Step 5: Since \\angle EOD is 40\\degree as given, \\angle EOF must be
half of that, so \\angle EOF = 40\\degree / 2 = 20\\degree.
Step 6: Notice that \\angle DCF and \\angle EOF are vertical angles
and hence are equal. Therefore, x = \\angle DCF = \\angle EOF.
Step 7: Substitute the value from Step 5 into the equation for x,
therefore x = 20\\degree.
The answer is x = 20\\degree.

[Question]: As shown in the figure, the diameter CD of \\odot O
crosses the midpoint G of chord EF, \\angle DCF = x , \\angle EOD is
equal to 40\\degree. What is the value of unknown variable x?
[Solution]:
Step 1: Recognize that angle \\angle EOD lies on the diameter of the
circle, which means it’s a central angle and the arc ED it intercepts
is 2x\\angle EOD = 2x40\\degree = 80\\degree.
Step 2: Since CD is a diameter, any angle formed on the circumference
by diameter CD is a right angle (90\\degree). Hence, angles \\angle
CFE and \\angle CED are 90 degrees each.
Step 3: The arc EG is half the circumference of the circle intercepted
by angle \\angle CFE, so the measure of arc EG is 180\\degree since
\\angle CFE is a right angle.
Step 4: Arc GF is the same as arc EG because G is the midpoint of EF,
hence arc GF is also 180\\degree.
Step 5: The entire arc EF, which is the sum of arcs EG and GF, is
180\\degree + 180\\degree = 360\\degree - 80\\degree = 280\\degree
since the circle is 360\\degree and we must subtract arc ED (80\\
degree) which is not part of arc EF.
Step 6: The angle \\angle DCF is an inscribed angle that intercepts
arc EF. The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the
arc it intercepts.
Step 7: Calculate the measure of angle \\angle DCF which is half of
the measure of arc EF: x = 1/2 * 280\\degree = 140\\degree.
The answer is 140\\degree.
