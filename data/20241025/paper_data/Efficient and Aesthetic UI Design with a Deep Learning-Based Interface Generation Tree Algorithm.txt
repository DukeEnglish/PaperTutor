II. METHOD We further introduced position encoding to maintain the
position information of elements in the input sequence [13].
In the study of Transformer-based interface generation trees,
Position encoding can be expressed as follows:
we mainly focus on how to use the Transformer architecture to
achieve efficient user interface (UI) generation. First, we need
to build a model that can understand UI elements and their
relationships. We will use a sequence-to-sequence Transformer
model to generate corresponding UI interface elements from
the input design specifications.
Our method first includes data preprocessing. We collected a
large amount of UI design data, which includes different types
of UI components such as buttons, text boxes, drop-down
menus, etc. Each component has information such as its Among them, pos is the position of the element in the

complexities and scenarios our model can proficiently handle.
To enhance this aspect, we propose integrating reinforcement
learning techniques with our existing Transformer framework.
This approach will allow the model to dynamically adjust its
strategies based on feedback from performance metrics,
including user satisfaction and aesthetic value. By continuously
optimizing these outputs, reinforcement learning will not only
refine the effectiveness of our UI generation process but also
improve its efficiency, pushing the boundaries of what is
achievable in automated UI design. At each generation stage,
we evaluate the usability and aesthetics of the currently
generated UI interface and adjust the generation strategy of the
model based on the feedback. Specifically, we define a reward
