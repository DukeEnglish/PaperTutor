1 Introduction
The facility location problem is a widely studied problem, with decades of literature spanning the fields
of operations research, economics, and computer science. In the classic variant of the problem, agents are
locatedonaunidimensionalinterval,andwearetaskedwithfindinganideallocationtoplaceafacilitywhich
serves these agents. The agents have single-peaked preferences for the facility location, as they incur a cost
equal to their distance from the facility. This problem models many real-world single-peaked social choice
and preference aggregation problems. The geographical placement of public facilities such as libraries and
parks is an immediate example [15], and the problem can also be applied to choose a political or economic
outcome [5, 8], or to decide how to divide a budget [9]. Furthermore, the one-dimensional setting can be
generalized to a multi-dimensional setting with an L distance metric [19, 11], or extended to a network
1
setting [22].
In our setting, we assume that the agents’ locations are private information, and take a strategyproof
mechanism design approachto the classic facility location problem. We also add an additional dimension of
complexity: each agent’s cost is scaled by an external factor corresponding to the facility’s location on the
domain. Specifically, there is a (continuous) scaling function which maps the facility location to a positive
scalingfactorwhichismultipliedbyeachagent’sdistancetocalculatetheirindividualcosts.Alocalminimum
ofthescalingfunctionimpliesthatthefacilityisparticularlyeffectivewhenplacedatthispoint.Theprimary
motivation for our model is the placement of a cell-phone tower, which is most effective when it is on top
of a hill, and less effective as it is placed lower on the hill. Each signal broadcasted or received by the radio
towerhasafailure probabilitydepending onitselevation,andthis averagesoutovertime tobe the facility’s

transportation, or of a warehouse to a shipping port. Similarly, placing the facility at a local maximum is
relatively ineffective (such as placing the cell phone tower at the bottom of a valley, or a public facility next
to a garbagedump), and the scaling function improves up to an extent as the facility moves awayfrom this
point.
In our paper, we consider the general class of continuous scaling functions, as well as piecewise linear

more complex scaling functions. To demonstrate our model, consider the example in Figure 1, where there

Under the classic model, the median and midpoint mechanisms are known to minimize total and maximum
cost, respectively. In our example, they place the facility at 0 and 0.3 respectively, resulting in 0.6×2=1.2
total cost and 0.33 maximum cost. However, placing the facility at the scaling function’s minimum of 0.5 is
optimal for both objectives, leading to 0.55 total cost and 0.25 maximum cost.

The goal of our paper is to design strategyproof mechanisms for our scaled facility location problem,
that have ideal approximations of the optimal total or maximum cost. These two objectives are standard
measures of efficiency and egalitarian fairness in facility location mechanism design [20]. A key consequence
of the scaling function is that the agents’ preferences may no longer be single-peaked, and thus we cannot
immediatelyleverageexistingcharacterizationsofstrategyproofmechanismsundersingle-peakedpreferences
(e.g.,[16,5]).We thereforeconsiderthe sufficientandnecessaryconditionsonthe scalingfunction suchthat
the agents’ preferences are single-peaked, and design reasonable strategyproof mechanisms for such scaling
functions.

2 Related Work
The facility location problem can be interpreted as a special case of preference aggregation when agents
have symmetric and single-peaked preferences over a continuous range of outcomes, in which there has
been decades of research in strategyproof aggregation rules. For general preferences, the famous Gibbard-
Satthertwaite theorem implies that a surjective and strategyproof rule must be dictatorial [10, 21]. This
impossibility result vanishes when we consider the restricted domain of single-peaked preferences, in which
there have been numerous characterizations of strategyproof rules. Most notably, under this restricted do-
main,Moulin[16]’sseminalpapercharacterizesthe spaceofstrategyproofandanonymousrulesasPhantom
mechanisms which output the median of the agent locations and n+1 constant ‘Phantom’ values. This
characterization was later extended to the domain of symmetric and single-peaked preferences by Border
and Jordan [5] and Mass´o and Moreno De Barreda [14]. Other characterizationsof strategyproof rules have
been proposed for similar settings by [4, 17, 18, 12].
Thepapermostsimilartoourworkconsidersthefacilitylocationmodelwithentrancefees[13],inwhich
agents incur, in addition to their distance from the facility, an additive cost which depends on the facility
placement. In this model, the authors give strategyproof mechanisms and compute their approximation
ratioswith respect to the total andmaximum costobjectives.The key difference with our modelis that our
agents experience a multiplicative scaling factor to their cost, whilst their agents experience an additional
additive cost. Our work and [13] are inspired by the line of research on approximate mechanism design
without money, initially proposed for the facility location problem by Procaccia and Tennenholtz [20]. In
theirpaper,theauthorscomputetheworst-caseratiobetweentheperformanceofstrategyproofmechanisms
and welfare-optimal mechanisms. There have since been many papers applying this approach to variations
of the facility location problem, such as when there are proportionally fair distance constraints [3], when
facilities have capacity limits [2, 1], or when the facility is obnoxious (i.e., agents prefer to be far awayfrom
the facility) [7]. A recent survey of related work is given by Chan et al. [6].

WehaveasetofagentsN ={1,...,n},whereagentihaslocationx onthedomain1X :=[0,1].Althoughwe
i
consider the space of potentially non-anonymousmechanisms, we assume for simplicity that agentlocations
are ordered such that x ≤ ··· ≤ x . This does not affect the nature of our results. A scaling function
1 n
q :X →R gives the effectiveness of a facility.2 We alsoassume that the scaling function is continuous.As
>0
we will show in Proposition1, continuity of q is required for the optimal facility location to be well-defined.
Denoting Q as the space of all scaling functions, facility location mechanism f :Q×Xn →X maps the
agent location profile x = (x ,...,x ) to the location of a facility y. We define the cost incurred by agent
1 n
i as its distance from the facility multiplied by the scaling factor: c (q,y):= q(y)|y−x |. Finally, we define
i i
the total cost of an instance as TC(q,y,x) := c (q,y) = q(y) |y−x |, and the maximum cost of an
i i i i
instance as MC(q,y,x) := max c (q,y) = q(y)max |y −x |. Respectively, we denote the optimal facility
i i i i
location which minimizes the total cost (resp. mP aximum cost) as yP∗ (resp. y∗ ).
TC MC
It is typically ideal for the mechanism output to be independent of the agents’ labelling, so we are
concerned with mechanisms that satisfy anonymity.
Definition 1. A mechanism f is anonymous if its output does not change when the agents’ labels are
permuted.
4 Computing the Optimal Solution

discontinuity may result in the optimal solution being not well-defined.
1 Although we consider the unit interval domain, our results can be scaled and shifted to any compact interval on
R. Weconsider a bounded domain so that a single-peaked linear scaling function does not takenegative values.
2 If thereis a point y where q(y)=0, then it is trivial toplace thefacility at that point.4 ..
Proposition 1. There exists a scaling function with a discontinuity and an agent location profile such that
the optimal facility locations for total cost y∗ and maximum cost y∗ are not well-defined.

optimalfacilitylocationsfortotalcostandmaximumcostaretherightlimity∗ →0.5+,butnotaty∗ =0.5,
so the optimal solutions are not well-defined.
4.1 Total Cost
We now give computational results on the optimal facility location for total cost, beginning with the class
of linear scaling functions.
Proposition 2. If q is a linear function, the optimal facility location for total cost y∗ is either on one of
TC
the agents’ locations, or the minimum value of q.
Proof. Since q is a linear function, it is of the form q(y)=ay+b, where a ∈R and b∈R . If a =0, then
>0
q(y) is constant, and thus the optimal facility location is on the median agent.3
Due to symmetry, it suffices to consider the case where the scaling function is increasing, i.e., a > 0.
From this assumption, we know that the optimal solution cannot lie to the right of x .
n
Since q isincreasingwithy,its minimumvalue is ony =0.We denote x :=0,andweknowthe optimal
0
solution y∗ is in the interval [x ,x ]. Suppose the optimal solution y∗ is in the interval [x ,x ], where
0 n n1 n1+1
n ∈ [0,n−1] denotes the number of agents on the left-hand side of y∗. Also, let n = n−n denote the
1 2 1
number of agents on the right-hand side of y∗.
Recall that the total cost corresponding to y∗, TC(q,y∗,x) is q(y∗) |y∗ −x |. Considering the term
i i
|y∗−x |, we have

i= Xn1+1 Xi=1
We remark that |y∗ −x | can also be written as a linear function of y∗: |y∗ −x | = a′y∗ +m with
i i i i
a′ := n −n , and m := n x − n1 x . We can therefore express the total cost as the following

Now we know that the total cost function can either be a linear function or a quadratic function of y∗,
depending on whether a′ = 0, a′ < 0, or a′ > 0 (recalling that a > 0). There are three cases: either the
total cost function is a linear function (a′ = 0), a quadratic function which opens downwards (a′ <0), or a
quadratic function which opens upwards(a′ >0). For the first two cases,it is clear that the minimum value
of the totalcost function must lie on an endpoint of the interval [x ,x ]. It remains to consider the last
n1 n1+1
case (a′ >0), where the total cost function q(y∗) |y∗−x |=aa′y∗+(am+a′b)y∗+bm opens upwards.
i i
Consider the total cost function on the larger domain of R. Since a′ = (n −n ) > 0, we know there exists
1 2
z ∈ R such that a′z +m = 0. Also, since a > 0P , there exists z ∈ R such that q(z ) = 0. As a result, we
1 1 2 2
see that the total cost function is equal to zero at either one or two points on R; we now show that both of
these points lie to the left of x .

Now consider z , which satisfies q(z ) = 0. Clearly, z < 0 as we must have q(y) > 0 for y ∈ [0,1] and
2 2 2
a>0, implying z <x .
2 n1
Since z ,z < x , the total cost function must be strictly increasing in [x ,x ], so its minimum
1 2 n1 n1 n1+1
value must lie on x , which is either an agent location or the minimum value of q.
n1
We can generalise this result to continuous, piecewise linear scaling functions.
Theorem 1. Let the scaling function q be a continuous, piecewise linear function. The facility location
minimizing total cost y∗ is either on one of the agents’ locations or on a local minimum of q.
TC
Proof. First,considereachlinesegmentonq,whichisrepresentedbyalinearfunctionq onthe sub-domain
j
[c ,d ], where c ,d ∈ X. Let y∗ := argmin TC(q,y ,x) denote the optimal facility placement on
j j j j j yj∈[cj,dj] j
[c ,d ], and e := argmin q(y) be the minimum point of q on [c ,d ]. By Proposition 2, we must
j j j y∈{cj,dj} j j
have y∗ ∈{e ,x ,...,x }. Therefore,considering all of the q functions, the optimal solution y∗ must lie at
j j 1 n j
one of the agents’ positions or at a local minimum of q .
j
Corollary 1. When q is a continuous, piecewise linear function with a constant number of local minima,
the optimal facility location can be found in linear time by simply iterating over the agent locations and the
local minima of the scaling function.
Asweassumeagentlocationsareprivateinformation,thereisaconcernthatagentsmaymisreporttheir
locations to unfairly attain a better facility placement. It is therefore ideal to implement a strategyproof
mechanism, which does not incentivize agents to lie about their locations.
Definition 2 (Strategyproofness). A mechanism f(·) is strategyproofif for every agent i∈N, we have,
for every scaling function q and agent locations x′, x and x ,
i −i i
c (q,f(x ,x ))≤c (q,f(x′,x )).
i i −i i i −i
However, we find that the optimal solution is not strategyproof.
Proposition 3. The optimal facility placement which minimizes total cost is not strategyproof, even if the
scaling function is a linear function and there are only 3 agents.
Proof. Suppose the scaling function is q(y) = 1− 4y and the agent location profile is x = (0.3,0.4,0.7).
5
The optimal facility placement is y = 0.4, which leads to a cost of 0.204 for agent x . However if agent x
3 3
misreports x′ =0.755,then the facility placement is instead y′ =1, which leads to a cost of 0.06.Hence the
3
optimal facility placement is not strategyproof.
4.2 Maximum Cost
We now consider the optimalfacility locationfor maximumcost. It is well-knownthat in the classic setting,

Proposition 4. If q is a linear function, the optimal facility location for maximum cost satisfies y∗ ∈
MC
{0,x1+xn,1}.
26 ..
Proof. Suppose q is of the form q(y) = ay + b, and recall that the maximum cost of the instance is
MC(q,y,x)=max c (q,y)=max (ay+b)|y−x |. Due to symmetry it suffices to consider a>0.
i i i i
Since a > 0, we know that y∗ ∈/ (x ,1], as such a facility placement has a strictly higher cost for all

the facility satisfies y ≤ x1+xn, then we also know that agent n incurs the highest cost, as it has the highest

We now know that if a > 0, the maximum cost is MC(q,y,x) = c (q,y) = (ay+b)(x −y), which is a

which is minimized when y =1 or y = x1+xn. We therefore have y∗ ∈{0,x1+xn,1}.
2 MC 2
We can also similarly show that when computing y∗ for continuous scaling functions, we only need to
MC
consider the optimal facility location with respect to the leftmost and rightmost agents.
Proposition 5. For continuous scaling functions, the optimal facility location for maximum cost satisfies
x +x
y∗ ∈ argmin c (q,y), argmin c (q,y), 1 n .
MC n 1 2
(y∈[0,x1+xn] y∈[x1+xn,1] )
2 2
Proof. If y ∈ [0,x1+xn], then agent n receives the highest cost in the instance, similar to the proof of
2
Proposition 4. A symmetric argument shows that if y ∈ [x1+xn,1], then agent 1 receives the highest cost
2
in the instance. Therefore y∗ is either on the minimum value of c (q,y) on y ∈ [0,x1+xn], the minimum
MC n 2
value of c (q,y) on y ∈[x1+xn,1], or on x1+xn.
1 2 2
We next investigate whether there exist non-trivial strategyproof mechanisms for this setting.
5 Achieving Single-Peaked Preferences
When agents have single-peaked preferences along a real line domain, Moulin [16] characterized the set of
anonymous and strategyproof mechanisms as phantom mechanisms, which place the facility at the median
of the n agent locations and n+1 constant ‘phantom’ points.
Definition 3 (Phantom Mechanism). Given x and n+1 constant values 0≤p ≤p ≤···≤p ≤1,
1 2 n+1
a phantom mechanism places the facility at med{x ,··· ,x ,p ,··· ,p }.
1 n 1 n+1
However,we find that in our setting, phantommechanisms are not necessarilystrategyproof.Eventhe well-
studied median mechanism, a phantom mechanism with ⌈n+1⌉ phantoms at 0 and ⌊n+1⌋ phantoms at 1, is
2 2
not strategyproof.
Proposition 6. The median mechanism is not strategyproof.
6−10y, y ≤0.5,
Proof. Considertheagentlocationprofilex=(0.5,0.7,0.9)andthescalingfunctionq(y)=
(10y−4, y >0.5.
The median mechanism places the facility at y =0.7, and it leads to a cost of 0.6 for agent x . However
3
if the agent at x misreports to x′ = 0.5, then the median facility placement will be 0.5, which leads to a
3 3
lower cost of 0.4 for the agent at x . Hence the median mechanism is not strategyproof.
3
In fact, if there are at least two unique phantom locations, the phantom mechanism is not strategyproof.
Theorem 2. Every phantom mechanism with n+1 phantoms on at least two unique phantom locations is
not strategyproof.Facility Location Games with Scaling Effects 7
Proof. Suppose the n+1 phantoms are located on k ∈ {2,...,n+1} unique points (a ,a ,··· ,a ). We

on a as n∗, the facility is placed on the (n+1−n∗)th agent under this profile. Now suppose the scaling

Case 1 (n+1−n∗ ∈ {2,...,n}): With all agents located in [a 1,a 2], we also specifically let x n−n∗ =
a 1,x n+1−n∗ = 3a1 4+a2, and x n+2−n∗ = a1+ 2a2. In such case, the mechanism places the facility at x n+1−n∗,

The last inequality is due to aa 21 ++ aa 11 < aa 21 ++ 11. If x n−n∗ misreports to x′ n−n∗ = a1+ 2a2, then f(x′)= a1+ 2a2, and
their new cost becomes c (n−n∗)(q,f(x′))=(1− a a1 2+ +1 1)(a2− 2a1)<c (n−n∗)(q,f(x)).

Therefore,aphantommechanismwhichdoesnotplaceallphantomsatthesamepositionisnotstrategyproof.
From this theorem, we arrive at the following corollary. Note that the constant mechanism is equivalent to
the phantom mechanism with all n+1 phantoms at the same location.
Corollary 2. The constant mechanism (which places the facility at some constant c ∈ X) is the only
anonymous and strategyproof mechanism in our setting.
This is because the scaling function may cause the agent’s preference to no longer be single-peaked. To
showthis,wefirstdefine eachagent’sutility asthe negativeoftheir cost(u (q,y):=−c (q,y)),sothattheir
i i
preference (with respect to cost) is single-peaked if and only if their utility is single-peaked. We therefore
use the terms ‘utility functions’ and ‘preferences’ interchangeably throughout the paper.8 ..
Theorem 3. Anagent’spreferencemaynotbesingle-peaked,evenifthescalingfunctionisalinearfunction.
Proof. Consider the scaling function q(y) = y +0.01 and x = 0.5. The derivative of agent 1’s utility is
1
u′(q,y)=2y−0.49when y <0.5,andu′(q,y)=−(2y−0.49)wheny >0.5.For y ∈[0,0.245],u′(q,y)≤0.
1 1 1
For y ∈[0.245,0.5], u′ ≥0. Lastly, for y ∈[0.5,1], u′(q,y)<0. Therefore u (q,y) is not single-peaked.
1 1
However, we can characterize the conditions on the scaling functions which ensure that agents have
single-peaked preferences. These conditions hold as long as q is continuous, even if it is not differentiable at
a countable set of points D.
Theorem 4. IfqiscontinuousbutnotdifferentiableatacountablesetofpointsD :={j|q′(j)does not exist},
the agents’ preferences are guaranteed to be single-peaked if and only if q(y)−|q′(y)|≥0 for all y ∈[0,1]\D.
Proof. Recall that the utility function for agent x is

By using this theorem, we can characterize the conditions on linear scaling functions which result in
agents having single-peaked preferences.
Corollary 3. If q is a linear function of the form q(y) = ay+b, the agents’ preferences are guaranteed to
be single-peaked if and only if b≥a for a>0, and b≥−2a for a<0.
We also observe that a sufficiently large constant c can be added to any continuous scaling function
to ensure that every agent has a single-peaked preference. This can be explained by the scaling function
becoming ‘closer’ to a constant scaling function.
We can also apply Theorem 4 to piecewise linear scaling functions to characterize the conditions for
agents to have single-peaked preferences.
Proposition 7. Ifq is a continuouspiecewise linear function where each linesegmentis oftheform q (y)=

6 Approximation Ratio Results
In this section, we give results on the approximation ratio of certain mechanisms. The approximation ratio
of a mechanism quantifies its worst-case performance for a specified objective function.

ratio is

prove approximation ratio bounds for more restricted classes of scaling functions, such as piecewise linear
scaling functions, and scaling functions such that agents are guaranteed to have single-peaked preferences.
For simplicity of notation, we let r := maxy∈Xq(y) be the ratio between the highest and lowest values of
q miny∈Xq(y)
the scaling function.
We begin with an impossibility result in the general continuous setting, which explains our need to
restrict the scaling function parameters to ensure single-peakedness and widen the space of strategyproof
and anonymous mechanisms.
Theorem 5. Every strategyproof and anonymous mechanism has an unbounded approximation ratio for
total and maximum cost.
Proof. By Moulin [16]’s characterization,a strategyproofandanonymousmechanismin our setting must be
a phantom mechanism, as the classic setting is a special case of our setting. By Theorem 2, we also know
thataphantommechanismisonlystrategyproofifalln+1phantomsarelocatedatthesamelocation.Such
a phantom mechanism is equivalent to the constant mechanism, which has an unbounded approximation
ratio as it is not unanimous.
As we will show, our approximation ratio results are typically a function of r . We show that when the
q
scaling function is chosen such that agents have single-peaked preferences, the value of r is upper bounded
q
by a constant.
Theorem 6. When agents’ preferences are single-peaked, r ≤e.
q
Proof. From Theorem 4, we know that q(y)−|q′(y)| ≥ 0 for all y ∈ [0,1]\D, where D denotes the points
where q(y) is not differentiable.
First, consider the intervals where q′(y) > 0, and consequently q satisfies q(y)−q′(y) ≥ 0. We define a
functiong(y):=eyq(y),whereg′(y)=ey(q(y)−q′(y)).Weknowg(y)isnon-decreasingbecauseq(y)−q′(y)≥
0. Consider the points y 1,y
2
∈ [0,1] where y
1
< y 2. Since g(y 1) ≤ g(y 2), we know that ey1q(y 1) ≤ ey2q(y 2).
Also, since q(y) > 0 and ey > 0, we have qq (( yy 21 )) ≤ ey2−y1, which is maximized when y
1
= 0 and y
2
= 1.
Therefore r ≤e. Furthermore, the function q(y)=ey satisfies q(y)−|q′(y)|≥0 and has r =e.
q q
Lastly,consider the intervals where q′(y)<0, and consequently q satisfies q(y)+q′(y)≥0. Similarly,we
defineg(y):=e−yq(y),whereg′(y)=e−y(q′(y)−q(y)).Weknowg(y)isnon-increasingbecauseq′(y)−q(y)≤
0.Considerthepointsy ,y ∈[0,1]wherey <y .Sinceg(y )≥g(y ),weknowthate−y1q(y )≥e−y2q(y ).
1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2
Also, since q(y)>0 and ey >0, we have qq (( yy 12 )) ≤ey2−y1, which is again maximized when y
1
=0 and y
2
=1.
Therefore r ≤e.
q
When q is a piecewise linear function, the upper bound of r is dependent on how many line segmentpieces
q
the function has.
Theorem 7. Suppose the scaling function q is a piecewise linear function with k line segment pieces. When
agents’ preferences are single-peaked, r ≤(1+ 1)k.
q k10 ..
Proof. Supposeforj ∈{1,...,k}thateachlinesegmentofqisdenotedasq (y)=a y+b .FromTheorem4,
j j j
for agents to always have single-peaked preferences, we require that q(y)−|q′(y)|≥0 for all y ∈[0,1]\{D},
where {D}denotesthe setofpoints where q(y)is notdifferentiable.This implies that foreachline segment,
if a >0, then a y+b −a >0 =⇒ b ≥(1−y)a . Similarly, if a <0, then b ≥−(1+y)a .

Consider a line segment piece q = a y+b , where y ∈ [s ,s ]. We now find an expression for r , which
j j j j−1 j qj
is the ratio between the maximum and minimum values of the scaling function on [s ,s ].
j−1 j
If a >0,then r = qj(sj) = ajsj+bj . Since we require b ≥(1−y)a ony ∈[s ,s ], we know that
j qj qj(sj−1) ajsj−1+bj j j j−1 j
b ≥(1−s )a . Therefore r = ajsj+bj ≤ ajsj+(1−sj−1)aj =(1+s −s ).
j j−1 j qj ajsj−1+bj ajsj−1+(1−sj−1)aj j j−1
If a < 0, then r = qj(sj−1) = ajsj−1+bj. Since we require b ≥ −(1+y)a on y ∈ [s ,s ], we know
j qj qj(sj) ajsj+bj j j j−1 j
that b ≥−(1+s )a . Therefore r = ajsj−1+bj ≤ ajsj−1−(1+sj)aj =(1+s −s ), and we know that for
j j j qj ajsj+bj ajsj−(1+sj)aj j j−1
each q , r ≤(1+s −s ).
j qj j j−1
Since q is piecewise linear, its global maxima and minima must be elements of S. We take an arbi-
trary global minimum s := argmin q(y) and global maximum s := argmax q(y), where
min y∈X] max y∈X
s ,s ∈S, and suppose w.l.o.g. that s <s . It also suffices to assume that for each line segment
min max min max
q between s and s , we have a > 0 (i.e. the function is strictly increasing in [s ,s ]). This
j min max j min max
means that r is the product of the r between s and s . Finally, since 1≤r ≤(1+s −s ), and
q qj min max qj j j−1
k
applying the arithmetic mean-geometric mean inequality, we have r ≤ (1+s −s )≤(1+ 1)k.
q i i−1 k

Q
When the amount of line segments k approaches infinity, the upper bound of r asymptotically meets the
q
upper bound of r = e for general scaling functions. Intuitively, this can also be seen by constructing a
q
piecewise linear function which approximates the function q(y)=ey.
We follow up with another result which restricts the space of phantom mechanisms with a bounded
approximation ratio.
Lemma 1. A phantom mechanism which does not place at least one phantom on 0 and 1 has an unbounded
approximation ratio for total cost and maximum cost.
Proof. Due to symmetry it suffices to consider phantom mechanisms which do not have any phantoms on
1. If all agents are located at 1, the optimal total and maximum cost are 0, but such a phantom mechanism
must place the facility at a location strictly left of 1, as all n+1 phantoms are strictly left of 1. Therefore
the total cost and maximum cost approximation ratios are unbounded.
Thislemmashowsthatwhenprovingthe approximationresults,itsufficestoconsiderphantommechanisms
where p = 0 and p = 1. Such a phantom mechanism is equivalent to a phantom mechanism with only
1 n+1
n−1 phantoms, and is known to characterize the strategyproof and anonymous mechanisms which place
the facility between the leftmost and rightmost agent locations [16].
6.1 Total Cost
We now prove approximation ratio results for the objective of total cost, a standard utilitarian measure of
efficiency.Webeginbygivingalowerboundontheapproximationratioachievablebyaphantommechanism,
with a proof which applies to both continuous and piecewise linear scaling functions.
Theorem 8. For continuous and piecewise linear scaling functions, any phantom mechanism has a total
cost approximation ratio of at least r .
q
Proof. Weconsidertwocases:eitherallphantomsarelocatedat0or1,orthereisatleastonephantomthat
is not locatedat0 or1.We startwith the formercase,where the facility is locatedatsome agent.Forevery
such phantom mechanism, we can always construct an instance where the scaling function is highest at the
agentthatreceivesthe facility,so the correspondingtotalcostmustbe atleastmax q(y) |f (x)−x |,
y i med i
where f is the median mechanism. Now suppose that the instance has an even number of agents, with

x 6=x ,andthatthe scalingfunction is lowestat(x +x )/2.Placingthe facility atthis point
n/2 n/2+1 n/2 n/2+1Facility Location Games with Scaling Effects 11
results in the optimal total cost of min q(y) |f (x)−x |, and thus the total cost approximation ratio
y i med i
must be at least r in this case.
q
P
Nowconsiderthecasewhereatleastonephantomislocatedin(0,1).ByLemma1,itsufficestoconsider
phantom mechanisms with at least one phantom at 0 and 1, so we are interested in where the remaining
n−1 phantoms are placed. We show that for every phantom mechanism f where at least one phantom p
j
on (0,1) is not at the lowest point of the scaling function, there exists a phantom mechanism f′ that places
the n−1 phantoms at the lowest point of the scaling function and has a strictly lower approximationratio.
Specifically, if the scaling function has multiple global minima, the phantoms are placed at the leftmost
globalminimum on (0,1). If the scaling function only has globalminima on 0 and/or1, then for sufficiently
small ǫ>0, f′ places the phantoms at ǫ or 1−ǫ. For every agentlocation profile x such that f(x)=p , we
j
claimthereexistsanotherprofilex′ where,underf′,thetotalcostratiowiththeoptimaltotalcostisstrictly

j
factor c > 0 (so that each agent i’s distance changes from |x −p | to c|x −p |), and then translating the
i j i j
profile such that the facility is co-located4 with the n−1 phantoms of f′ and the relative distances between
the agentsandthe facility is the same butmultiplied bythe sufficiently smallconstantfactor.The distances
arestillc|x −p |,sothe ratiooftotalunscaleddistancesisstillthe same.Butnowthe facilityis placedata
i j
point where the scaling function value is strictly lower, so the total cost ratio is lower. Therefore f′ has the
lowest approximationratio of all phantom mechanisms which have at least one phantom on (0,1).
We now show that f′ has an approximation ratio of at least r . We define a scaling function q which
q
has a unique global minimum at some point c ∈ (0,1), a unique global maximum at c > c , and a
1 2 1
point c > c where q(c ) = q(c ) + ǫ, for sufficiently small ǫ > 0. Consider a location profile where
3 2 3 1
x = c < x = x = ··· = x = c . The mechanism f′ places the facility at x , resulting in a total cost of
1 2 2 3 n 3 1
(n−1)(x −x )max q(y), whilst the optimal total cost is at most (x −x )(min q(y)+ǫ) by placing the
n 1 y n 1 y
facility atc . Thereforef′ has anapproximationratioofatleastr . By exhaustionofcases,wesee that any
3 q
phantom mechanism has a total cost approximation ratio of at least r .
q
From this result, we can also easily see that among all of the phantom mechanisms, placing the facility at
the median agent gives the best possible approximation ratio for total cost.
Theorem 9. For continuous and piecewise linear scaling functions, the median mechanism has a total cost
approximation ratio of r .

Proof. Themedianmechanismminimizesthesumofdistances,soitstotalcostisatmostmax q(y) |f (x)−

Recall that phantom mechanisms characterize all strategyproof and anonymous mechanisms when agents
havesingle-peakedpreferences.Wecanconsiderscalingfunctionswhichensurethatagentshavesingle-peaked
preferences, and use Theorems 6 and 7 to find the specific total cost approximation ratio lower bounds for
any strategyproofand anonymous mechanism.
Corollary 4. For continuous scaling functions, when agents are guaranteed to have single-peaked prefer-
ences, any strategyproof and anonymous mechanism has a total cost approximation ratio of at least e.
Corollary 5. For piecewise linear scaling functions with k line segments, when agents are guaranteed to
have single-peaked preferences, any strategyproof and anonymous mechanism has a total cost approximation
ratio of at least (1+ 1)k.

Again,themedianmechanismwouldalsogivethebesttotalcostapproximationratio,andcanbesuitablyim-
plementedfortheserestrictedsetsofscalingfunctions.However,inascenariowherethescalingfunctiondoes
not guaranteesingle-peakedagentpreferences,phantom mechanismsno longerguaranteestrategyproofness,
and a constant mechanism has an unbounded approximation ratio. The dictator mechanism, which selects
a specific agent to be the dictator and places the facility at their reported location, is known to be strate-
gyproof for general agent preferences (though it is clearly not anonymous). We show that this mechanism
has a bounded approximation ratio for total cost.
4 This occurs as long as there are agents on both sides of the phantoms. Since the phantoms are placed at ǫ and
1−ǫ instead of 0 and 1, there is space on both sides of thephantoms.12 ..
Proposition 8. The dictator mechanism has a total cost approximation ratio of (n−1)r .
q
Proof. Suppose there are n−1 agents at the same location away from the dictator. Also suppose that the
scalingfunctionishighestatthedictator’slocation,andlowestattheothern−1agents’location.Thetotal

y∈X
where d ∈ (0,1], as the dictator receives 0 cost, and the optimal total cost is at least dmin q(y) when
y∈X
not all agents are at the same point.
6.2 Maximum Cost
We next prove approximation ratio results for the objective of maximum cost, a standard measure of egali-
tarianfairness.We beginby givingthe maximumcostapproximationratioofanyphantommechanismwith
p =0 andp =1,andagainthe proofapplies to both continuousand piecewise linear scalingfunctions.
1 n+1
Theorem 10. For continuous and piecewise linear scaling functions, any phantom mechanism with p =0
1
and p =1 has a maximum cost approximation ratio of 2r .
n+1 q
Proof. We first prove that for every phantom mechanism f with p =0 and p =1, there exists an agent
1 n+1
profile where the facility is placed at either x or x . Due to symmetry, it suffices to consider the former
1 n
case, where we require that p <1 and x =x =··· =x > p . Consider such an agent location profile
2 1 2 n−1 2
where the facility is placed at x and x 6= x , and also consider a scaling function which has a global
1 1 n
maximum at x and a global minimum at x1+xn. We have MC(q,f(x),x) = (x −x )max q(y) and
1 2 n 1 y∈X
MC(q,y∗ ,x)= xn−x1 min q(y), giving MC(q,f(x),x) = 2r . Thus, for every phantom mechanism with
MC 2 y∈X MC(q,y∗ ,x) q
MC
at least one phantom on 0 and 1, we can construct an agent location profile and scaling function such that
the cost ratio is 2r , proving the lower bound.
q
To see that the approximation ratio is at most 2r , note that a phantom mechanism with p = 0
q 1
and p = 1 ensures the facility is placed within [x ,x ], so the mechanism’s maximum cost is at most
n+1 1 n
(x −x )max q(y), whilst the optimal maximum cost is at least xn−x1 min q(y).
n 1 y∈X 2 y∈X
As in the previous section, we can also derive the maximum cost approximation ratios when the scaling
functions are restricted such that agents have single-peaked preferences.
Corollary 6. For continuous scaling functions, when agents are guaranteed to have single-peaked prefer-
ences, any strategyproof and anonymous mechanism has a maximum cost approximation ratio of at least
2e.
Corollary 7. Forpiecewiselinearscalingfunctionswithk linesegments,whenagentsareguaranteedtohave
single-peaked preferences, any strategyproof and anonymous mechanism has a maximum cost approximation
ratio of at least 2(1+ 1)k.
k
Finally, we prove the maximum cost approximation ratio for the dictator mechanism, which ensures strate-
gyproofness for all scaling functions.
Proposition 9. The dictator mechanism has a maximum cost approximation ratio of 2r .
q
Proof. Consider an agent location profile where x = x = ··· = x and x 6= x . When the scal-
1 2 n−1 n 1
ing function has its minimum value at x1+xn and its maximum value on the facility/dictator, we have
2
MC(q,f(x),x)
=2r , showing that the approximationratiois at least2r . For the matching upper bound, we
MC(q,y∗ ,x) q q
MC
note that the mechanism’s maximum costis at most (x −x )max q(y) and the optimal maximum cost
n 1 y∈X
is at least xn−x1 min q(y).

7 Discussion
In this paper, we have initiated the study of facility location problems where the agents’ costs include a
multiplicative scaling factor which depends on where the facility is placed. This problem applies to many
real-worldscenarioswherethefacility’seffectivenessdependsonexternalfactorsinfluencingitslocation.Our
results focus onthe objectives oftotalcostandmaximumcost,andonboth continuousandpiecewise linear
scaling functions.
Althoughwefocusonsingle-peakedagentpreferencesandhavesomemechanismdesignresultsforgeneral
agent preferences, the agent preferences in our setting are a strict subspace of general preferences, taking
the form where the metric distance is multiplied by some continuous scaling function. An open question
is to characterize the deterministic mechanisms satisfying strategyproofness and surjectivity under these
preferences, which we conjecture to be dictatorships.
There aremany naturalextensions to our paper.We canconsider multiple facilities and multiple dimen-
sions, as well as randomizedmechanisms.We could also restrictfurther the space of piecewise linear scaling
functions to single-dipped or single-peakedlinear scaling functions, and find evenlower approximationratio
bounds. Finally,our conceptof scalingfunctions canbe applied to existing variationsof the facility location
problem, such as capacitated facilities [1] and obnoxious facility location [7].14 ..
