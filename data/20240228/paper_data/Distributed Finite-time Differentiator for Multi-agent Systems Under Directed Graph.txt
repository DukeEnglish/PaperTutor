I. INTRODUCTION
The differentiator means that for a real-time measurable signal f(t), design an algorithm to estimate f˙(t) under certain
conditions.Basedonthesecond-orderslidingmodealgorithm,namelythesuper-twistingalgorithm[1],afamousdifferentiator
algorithm was proposed in [2]. Considering that many mechanical systems can be modeled by a second-order system, the
super-twisting algorithm was employed to solve the control problem in [3]. For the high-order systems, the corresponding
differentiator algorithm and output feedback control algorithm were introduced in [4]. In order to accelerate the convergence
speed, uniformly convergentdifferentiators were proposed in [5], [6].
The above differentiator can be regarded as centralized differentiator. With the development of science and technology,
networks are playing an increasingly important role [7]. In the early stage, in [8], [9], the asymptotical consensus of second-
order leader-follower MAS was realized by designing distributed observers. The distributed observers for linear systems were
studied in [7], [10], [11]. In [12], the cooperativeoutput regulation of LTI plant was solved based on the distributed observer.
Consideringtheuncertaintyanddisturbanceofthesystem,robustdistributedobserverswereproposedin[13],[14].Combining
withadaptivecontrolmethod,adaptivedistributedobserverswereproposedin[15]–[17].Inaddition,distributedfinite-timeand
fixed-timeobserverswereproposedin[18],[19],respectively.However,mostoftheseobserversneedtheleader’sinternalstate
information(equivalentto f˙(t)) or controlinputinformation(equivalentto f¨(t)), so they are notdistributeddifferentiators.To
the best of our knowledge, no related algorithm can achieve the same function, i.e., distributed finite-time differentiator.
In the cooperative control of leader-follower MAS, the full states or partial internal states of leader are required in most
works, which precludes many practical applications where only the output of the leader system is available [20]. In practice,
sometimesonlytherelativepositioninformationcanbeobtainedratherthantheabsoluteglobalposition,andforeachfollower
agent, the more important information is the relative position and relative velocity between itself and the leader, rather than
the absolute globalposition and absolute globalvelocity.For example,for groupsof mobile robots,the globalpositionsof the
robots are usually not available while the relative position measurements should be used instead [21]. In addition, it is more
difficultto getvelocityandaccelerationmeasurementsthanpositionmeasurement[22], [23] and the followeragentsmightnot
be equipped with velocity sensors to save space, cost and weight [24], [25]. Therefore, the study of distributed observer and
controller based only on the relative position information has important theoretical significance and practical value [26].
Themaincontributionsofthispaperaregivenasfollows.Firstly,unlikethecentralizedfinite-timedifferentiator,aframework
of distributed finite-time differentiator (DFD) is proposed, which can achieve the exact differential estimation only if the
differentiable signal f(t) is available for at least one agent. The distributed finite-time differentiator can be realized via
the absolute position information or relative position information, which is more available for formation control without
global position information. Secondly, the distributed finite-time differentiator is employed to design a new distributed finite-
time consensus control algorithm, which can achieve finite-time output consensus of a class of leader-follower MAS under

The output degree of v is defined as: deg (v ) = d = n a = a . D = diag{d ,··· ,d } is called as the

i j
different vertices, which starts with v and ends with v and each step is included in the set E. A directed graph Ψ is said to
i j
be strongly connected if there is a path from v to v between each pair of distinct vertices v , v . In addition, if AT = A,
i j i j
then Ψ(A) is said to be an undirected graph. For every different vertices v and v , there is a path from v to v , then Ψ

is said to be connected. If there is a leader, the connectivity between the leader and each follower agent is represented by
vector b = [b ,b ,...,b ]T ∈ Rn. If agent i can get the leader’s information, then b > 0, otherwise, b = 0. Besides, define

III. MOTIVATIONS
For better explanation, we first give the definitions of centralized finite-time differentiator and distributed finite-time differ-
entiator.
Definition 1: (Centralized finite-time differentiator) [2], [4]–[6] The differentiatormeans that for a real-time measurable
signal f(t), design an algorithm to estimate f˙(t) in a finite time under the condition |f¨(t)| ≤ l, where l is a known positive
constant.
Definition2:(Distributedfinite-timedifferentiator)Thedifferentiatorisadistributedsensornetworkcomposedofmultiple
agents. As long as some of agents (at least one agent) can directly measure the signal f(t), then all agents can obtain exact
estimates of f(t) and f˙(t) in a finite time under condition |f¨(t)|≤l, where l is a known positive constant.
Similarity and difference of two kind of differentiators are as follows.
Similarity. Only signal f(t) is available under the condition |f¨(t)|≤l, while f˙(t) and f¨(t) are not available.
Difference.The centralizedfinite-time differentiatormeansthateach agentcan obtain the signalf(t), while some of agents
(at least one agent) can get the signal f(t) for the case of distributed finite-time differentiator.
Centralized finite-time differentiator is generally implemented by second-order sliding mode algorithms or higher-order
sliding mode algorithms, which can be used for state observer design, disturbance observation, and output feedback control
[2], [4]–[6], [33]. However, centralized finite-time differentiator is not suitable for the distributed case, while the main aim
of this paper is to solve this problem. Besides, for the leader-follower MAS, in some practice, only the relative position
information can be obtained rather than the absolute global position [21]. For example, for a group mobile robots, based on
the vision sensor, the relative position information can be easily got. Motivated by above analysis, the distributed finite-time
differentiator via relative position information is also proposed.
IV. DISTRIBUTED FINITE-TIMEDIFFERENTIATOR
A. Problem statement
Assume that the leader’s and i-th agent’s positions are f(t) and x (t), respectively. The main aim of this paper is to
i
• design a distributed finite-time differentiator via relative position information (DFD-R),
• design a distributed finite-time differentiator via absolute position information (DFD-A),
• extend DFD to controller form, which will solve the finite-time output consensus problem of a class of leader-follower
MAS.
As that in [18], [19], [34], the communication network of MAS satisfies the following assumption.
Assumption 1: The communication topology of follower agents is strongly connected and at least one agent can directly
obtain the relative or absolute position information of leader in real time.
Assumption 2: The acceleration information of leader agent is bounded, i.e.,
|f¨(t)|≤l, (2)
where l is a positive constant.
B. Design of a distributed finite-time differentiator via relative position information
The dynamics of i-th follower agent is assumed to have the form of

where l = l+l , 0 < ρ < 1, γ = (1+3γ )/(1−ρ), γ = (1+ρ)max{w }, then each follower agent can estimate the

As a result, substituting (25) into (21) leads to
V˙ ≤−kγ−32 V 32 , (26)

which implies that V will converge to 0 in a finite time and the setting time T satisfies that T ≤ 3γ3V(0)/k. In other
2
words, it means that v = y = 0, which implies that z = 0. Furthermore, from Lemma 2.5, it can be seen that G =6
1 diag(w)L(A)+L(A)Tdiag(w) +diag(w)B is positive definite, and thus it is easy to obtain that L+B is a nonsingular
2
m(cid:0)atrix. Therefore, one has that e=(cid:1)(L+B)−1y=0. (cid:4)
Remark 1: If the communication topology is undirected and connected, according to Lemma 2.5, we have w = 1, i.e.,
w = 1. This means that γ =1+ρ, G=L(A)+diag(b), and the Lyapunov function (11) is also simplified, which makes
i 1
the subsequent proofs simpler. To avoid repetition, the proof is omitted.
Remark 2: In some situations, such as without GPS and other global measuring equipment, the absolute global position
and absolute global velocity cannot be obtained. Our proposed algorithm only needs the relative position information, which
is more suitable for some practical situations [21], [26], [36], [37]. Besides, many formation tracking/flying scenarios can be
dividedintotwo parts:distributedstate estimationanddesiredstate trackingbyonlyusingrelativepositioninformation,which
has important theoretical significance and practical value.
C. Design of distributed finite-time differentiator via absolute position information

or in the form of vector
e˙ =z−k ⌊y⌉1/2, z˙ =−k ⌊y⌉0+d. (29)
1 2
According to Assumption 2, it is evident that |d |≤l. By using a same proof as that in Theorem 1, it can be proved that the
i
system (29) is finite-time stable. (cid:4)
Remark 3: Compared to the first-order observer and second-order observer proposed by [37], the distributed finite-time
differentiator presented in this paper has three differences. Firstly, the proposed method in this paper only assumes that f¨is
bounded,withoutanyadditionalassumptionsontheownandneighbors’velocity.Secondly,theestimationresultofqˆ isalways
i
continuous and convergesto f˙ in a finite time. Thirdly, for a first-order multi-agent system, as demonstrated in Theorem 5.1,
theproposeddistributedfinite-timedifferentiatoralgorithmcanbeusedtodesignacontinuousfinite-timeconsensuscontroller.
However, if the first-order observer of [37] is used, only a discontinuous finite-time consensus controller can be designed to
suppress the disturbances.
Remark4:ThemaindifferencebetweenthetwoDFDsliesintheirusageconditionsorscenarios.DFD-Autilizestheleader’s
global absolute position information, enabling all follower agents to obtain the leader’s global absolute position information
andglobalabsolutevelocityinformation.Incontrast,DFD-Rutilizesthe relativepositioninformationwith theleader,enabling
all follower agents to obtain the relative position and relative velocity information with the leader. However, the connection
between the two DFDs lies in two aspects. Firstly, they are both distributed differential estimation algorithms, i.e., distributed
finite-time differentiator. Secondly, they share the same mathematical essence, i.e., equation (8).
V. Design of distributed finite-time consensus controller for leader-follower MAS
Inspired by the duality principle, we will show that how to extend the DFD to a new distributed finite-time consensus
control algorithm such that all agents’ output can achieve consensus in a finite time. Without loss of generality, the dynamics
of follower agent i is given as follow
x˙ (t)=f (t,x )+g (t,x )u ,
i i i i i i
s =s (t,x ), (30)
i i i
where n is the order of system, f (t,x ),g (t,x )∈Rni are smooth vector functions, x ∈Rni is the state vector, u ∈R is
i i i i i i i
the control input, and s ∈R is the output. Assume that the relative degree of output is one with regard to control input, i.e.,
i
s˙ =a (t,x )+b (t,x )u , (31)
i i i i i i7
where a (t,x ) is an unknown smooth function including possible uncertainties and external disturbance, etc., b (t,x )>0 is
i i i i
a known function.
The dynamics of leader agent is as follow
x˙ (t)=f (t,x ), s =s (t,x ), s˙ =a (t,x ), (32)
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
where n is the order of system, f (t,x ) ∈ Rn0 is a smooth vector function, x ∈ Rn0 is the state vector, s ∈ R is the
0 0 0 0 0
output, and a (t,x ) is an unknown smooth function.
0 0
Remark 5: Note that for any different agent i and agent j, the functions f , g , s , a , b and system’s order n can be
i i i i i i
different from f , g , s , a , b and n , respectively. It means that the dynamics of each agent can be completely different,
j j j j j j
i.e., heterogeneous.

Accordingto Assumption4, it is evidentthat |d |≤l. As a sequel, the followingproofcan be achievedby using a same proof
i
as (8) in Theorem 1 and is omitted here. (cid:4)
Remark 6: Actually,for the consensustrackingproblemof MAS (30)-(32), based on the variable structure controlmethod,
the finite-time consensus can be also achieved [27]. Inspired by but different from discontinuous consensus controllers [27],
[28],the consensuscontrollerproposedin thispaperiscontinuous,which notonlycompletelysuppressesdisturbance,butalso
avoids chattering.

In the simulation, we set x (t) = sin(t), δ (t) = −0.25sin(0.5t), δ (t) = −0.25cos(0.5t), δ (t) = −1.21cos(1.1t),
0 1 2 3
δ (t)=−0.64sin(0.8t), u =0,∀i∈{1,2,3,4}.The initialvaluesoffourfollowersare set as x (0)=0,x (0)=1,x (0)=
4 i 1 2 3
1,x (0)=0. The initial values of distributed finite-time differentiator (5) are set as: pˆ(0)=qˆ(0)=0,∀i∈{1,2,3,4}. The
4 i i
gainsof differentiatorare selected as: k =5,k =4. The response curvesof relative position estimation and relative velocity
1 2
estimation under communication topology A are shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, respectively. It can be seen from the figures that
each follower agentcan estimate the relative positionand relativevelocity between itself and the leader in a finite time, which
verifies the effectiveness of DFD-R.8

B. Distributed finite-time differentiator via absolute position information
The signal to be observed is: f = 0.6sin(t)+0.25cos(2t), thus f˙= 0.6cos(t)−0.5sin(2t) and |f¨|≤1.6< l =3 under
a conservative estimate. The initial values of distributed finite-time differentiator (27) are set as: pˆ(0) = qˆ(0) = 0,∀i ∈
i i
{1,2,3,4}. The gains of differentiator are selected as: k = 5,k = 4. The response curves of absolute position estimation

and absolute velocity estimation under communication topology A are shown in Fig. 4. It can be seen from Fig. 4 that each

of DFD-A.
C. Distributed finite-time consensus controller
On the basis of works [27], [38], we consider the following leader-follower MAS: s˙ (t) = a (t),s˙ (t) = a (t) + u ,
0 0 i i i
where s and s are the output of leader agent and i-th follower agent respectively, a and a are unknown functions
0 i 0 i
with bounded change rate, u is the control input of i-th follower agent. In this simulation, we set a (t) = cos(t) +
i 0
0.2cos(0.2t),a (t) = sin(1.5t),a (t) = 2cos(t),a (t) = cos(1.5t),a (t) = sin(0.5t). Then, |a˙ (t) − a˙ (t)| ≤ 3.1. For
1 2 3 4 i 0
controller (33), b = 1 and we set k = 8,k = 6, [v (0),v (0),v (0),v (0)] = [0,0,0,0]. The initial values of the system
i 1 2 1 2 3 4
are set as [s (0),s (0),s (0),s (0),s (0)]=[−1,1,1.5,−1,2].The response curvesof MAS’ outputand controlinput under

communication topology A are shown in Fig. 5. Note that the controller is continuous which is chattering-free and is also an
advantage by comparing with the discontinuous controller.9

VII. Conclusion
Inthispaper,distributedfinite-timedifferentiator(DFD)hasbeenproposedbyusingrelativeorabsolutepositioninformation,
and its finite-time stability has been proved by skillfully constructing Lyapunov function. The output consensus of a class of
leader-followerMAS has been achieved by extendingDFD. In the future, we will try to extend the DFD to higher-ordercase,
and apply the algorithm to formation coordination control by only using relative position information.
