Abstract. Inthecontextoffairdivision,theconceptofpriceoffairness
has been introduced to quantify the loss of welfare when we have to
satisfy some fairness condition. In other words, it is the price we have
to pay to guarantee fairness. Various settings of fair division have been
considered previously; we extend to the setting of indivisible goods by
usingegalitarianwelfareasthewelfaremeasure,insteadofthecommonly
used utilitarian welfare. Weprovidelower andupperboundsforvarious
fairness and efficiency conditions such as envy-freeness up to one good
(EF1) and maximum Nash welfare (MNW).

In a fair division problem, there are several possible goals to strive for. One
goalisfairness,whereeachindividualagentshouldfeeltheygetafairallocation;
another is social welfare, where the goal is to optimize the welfare of all agents
as a whole. These goals are not always aligned. For example, to maximize the
sumofutilitiesoftheagents(i.e.utilitarianwelfare),theoptimalallocationisto
assigneachitemto the agentthatvaluesitthe most.Clearlythis allocationcan
be far from fair, as an agent might be deprived of every item. However, making
the allocation fairer comes at the cost of decreasing the total welfare. In other
words, there is a price to pay if we want a division to be fair.
The notion of price of fairness was introduced independently by Bertsimas
et al. [6] and Caragiannis et al. [9] to capture this concept. Initially, the setting

was for utilitarian welfare on divisible goods. Since then, there have been other
works discussing the setting of utilitarian welfare with indivisible goods [4,5],
as well as the setting of egalitarian welfare with divisible goods [3,9]. Since the
same cannot be said for egalitarian welfare with indivisible goods, our paper
completes the picture by investigating this setting.
One problem with investigating fairness conditions is that they might not
have a satisfying allocation for some instances, especially when the goods are
indivisible. We follow the method in Bei et al. [5] of handling this problem by
consideringonlyfairnessconditionswhichcanalwaysbesatisfiedinallinstances
foranynumberofagents.Assuch,wedonotinvestigatepropertiessuchasenvy-
freeness and proportionality,which are not guaranteed to be satisfiable. Special
cases such as envy-freeness up to any good (EFX) which has been shown to be
satisfiable for n 3 agents can be considered for future works.
≤
We study the price of fairness of three fairness properties: envy-freeness up
to one good (EF1), balancedness, and round-robin. Not only are these proper-
ties always satisfiable, but an allocation which has all three properties can be
easily found by the round-robin algorithm. Furthermore, these fairness notions
are widely studied in the literature. In particular, tight bounds for the utilitar-
ian price of fairness of these properties have been found [5], which allows for
comparison between the utilitarian and egalitarianprices of fairness.
Moreover,wealsostudythepriceoffairnessoftwowelfaremaximizers:max-
imum utilitarian welfare (MUW) and maximum Nash welfare (MNW). While
these are efficiency notions instead of fairness notions, they are crucial to the
study of resource allocation. Studying their prices of fairness helps us compare
between the different types of welfare maximizers, and might shed light on if
and when one type of welfare function would best quantify social welfare.
1.1 Our Results
Weinvestigatetheupperandlowerboundsofthepriceoffairnessforfivefairness
and efficiency properties described above. Letting n be the number of agents
in the instance, we show that EF1, balancedness, and round-robin have price
of fairness Θ(n). Meanwhile, MUW and MNW have infinite price of fairness,
except for the caseof MNW with n=2 where the price of fairnessis finite. Our
results are summarized in Table 1. We have also included the utilitarian prices
of fairness found by Bei et al. [5] for comparison. We restrict our attention to
the general instances for any fixed n; future work can be done on specializing
to,say,instanceswithidenticalordering,orsomeotherconstraint,incaseitcan
bring down the price of fairness for some of the properties.
In a way, our results are surprising compared to the utilitarian results. Util-
itarian welfare is purely an efficiency notion, while egalitarian welfare captures
some sort of “fairness”, since maximizing the utility of the poorest agent means
that every agent’s utility is taken into consideration and no agent’s poverty
can be ignored. However, the egalitarian price of fairness for the properties are
actually worse (higher) than the utilitarian price of fairness. Despite appearingEgalitarian Price of Fairness for IndivisibleGoods 3

Asmentionedabove,Bertsimasetal.[6]andCaragiannisetal.[9]independently
introduced the concept of price of fairness. Bertsimas et al. studied it in the
contextofdivisiblegoods,whileCaragiannisetal.studiedbothgoodsandchores
whethertheyaredivisibleorindivisible.Sincethen,thepriceoffairnesshasbeen
studied in other settings. In the context of contiguous allocations, the price of
fairness has been studied for divisible goods [3], indivisible goods [24], divisible
chores [13] as well as indivisible chores [14]. Li et al. [18] studied the price
of fairness of almost weighted proportional allocations for indivisible chores.
Additionally,Bilòetal.[7]studieditinthecontextofmachinescheduling,while
Michorzewski et al. [20] studied it in the context of budget division.
Typically,the priceoffairnessrefersto the utilitarianpriceoffairnesswhich
measures the loss of utilitarianwelfare due to fairnessconstraints.However,the
price of fairness can also be defined with respect to other social welfare func-
tions.Forexample,inthecontextofegalitarianwelfare,AumannandDombb[3]
and Suksompong [24] studied the price of fairness for contiguous allocations of
divisible and indivisible goods respectively. More generally, Arunachaleswaran
et al. [2] used the generalized Hölder mean with exponent ρ as their welfare
function.In particular,when ρ=1,0, ,the generalizedmeancorrespondsto

of approximately envy-free allocations of divisible goods.
Most studies express the price of fairness as a function of the number of
agents n. However, there are cases where the price of fairness (for indivisible
goods) depends also on the number of goods m. Kurz [16] studied the price of
envy-freeness in terms of both the number of agents and the number of goods,
andshowedthatwhenthe number ofgoodsisnotmuchlargerthanthe number
of agents,the price of fairness can be much lower.Bei et al. [5] proveda similar
result for round-robin allocations.
More generally, fair division has been an active area of research, with many

focus on the setting of indivisible goods.
2 Preliminaries
An instance consists of the agents N = 1,2,...,n , the (indivisible) goods
I { }
M = 1,2,...,m , and each agent’s utility function u . We assume n 2.
i
{ } ≥
The utility function is nonnegative, i.e. u (j) 0 for all i,j. It is additive, i.e.
i
≥
u (A) = u (j) for a set of goods A. It is also normalized, i.e. u (M) = 1,
i j∈A i i
so that eaPch agent values the whole bundle identically.
An allocation for an instance is a partition (A ,...,A ) of the goods M

The maximum egalitarian welfare (MEW) (also optimal welfare) of
an instance is the highest possible egalitarian welfare for that instance; it is

For price of fairness, we use the convention 0/0=1 and x/0= for x>0.

The price of fairness of a property P over a family of instances is the supre-
mum of the price of fairness over those instances.
Price of fairness is traditionally represented as a function in terms of the
number of agents n. We follow this convention in this paper. In this case, for
any fixed n, the price of fairness for that n is the supremum over all instances
with n agents.

Definition 4 (RR). The round-robin algorithm takes an instance and
I
works as follows. First, it puts the agents in some order. Then, starting from
the first agent and following the order, looping around whenever we reach the
last agent, the algorithm assigns to an agent her most valuable good from those
remaining. In case of a tie, the algorithm breaks ties arbitrarily.
An allocation is round-robin (RR) if it is produced by the round-robin
algorithm, for some ordering of the agents and choices on tiebreaks.
Fact 5. A RR allocation is also EF1 and balanced [10]. As a result, since RR
is always satisfiable, EF1 and balancedness are also always satisfiable.
We also define and investigate the following efficiency notions:
Definition 6 (MUW). The utilitarian welfare of an allocation A is the
sum of utilities u (A ). The maximum utilitarian welfare (MUW) is
i i i
the maximum poPssible utilitarian welfare; an allocation achieving that is also
called MUW.
Definition 7 (MNW).TheNash welfareofanallocation Ais theproductof

possible NQash welfare; an allocation achieving that is also called MNW.

Before going to the proof, we establish some definitions.

Proof. Suppose EG has a directed cycle C of agents that envy the next in the

agent receives the bundle she envied.
Note that agents not in C retain their utilities, while agents in C strictly
improve their utilities. Therefore, ′ strongly dominates . This contradicts

We now describe the settings for the round-robinalgorithm. The ordering is

However, the MUW allocation is to assign goods 1 and 2 to agent 1, and

To add more agents, we simply introduce k new agents and k new goods so
that each new agent exclusively desires one of the new goods (with utility 1)
without any overlap. Then the MEW and MUW are still obtained by assigning
the new agents to the new goods, leaving only the original instance.

The MEW allocation is to assign good 1 to agent 1, good 2 to agent 2, and
good 3 to agent 3. The Nash welfare is ε2/4, and the egalitarian welfare is ε/2.
However,theMNWallocationistoassigngood1toagent1,good2toagent
3, and good 3 to agent 2. The Nash welfare is ε2/3, and the egalitarian welfare
is ε2/2. Thus the price of fairness is (ε/2)/(ε2/2) = 1/ε, which goes to as

To add more agents, we simply introduce k new agents and k new goods so
that each new agent exclusively desires one of the new goods (with utility 1)
without any overlap. Then the MEW and MNW are still obtained by assigning
the new agents to the new goods, leaving only the original instance.

5 Conclusion
We extended the notion of price of fairness to a combination that has not been
investigated yet in the literature: egalitarian welfare with indivisible goods. We
found upper and lower bounds for the (egalitarian) price of fairness for several
different fairness conditions: envy-free up to one good, round-robin, balanced,
utilitarian welfare maximizing, and Nash welfare maximizing.
Similar to the results for utilitarian welfare found by Bei et al. [5] and Bar-
man et al. [4], our results establish the asymptotic growth exactly. In fact, for
balancedness, we not only derive the asymptotic growth, but the exact growth
downtotheconstant.Westillhaveamultiplicativegapof2betweenthebounds
for EF1 and RR.
For welfare maximizers, it turns out that in many of the cases, maximizing
any other welfare can come at arbitrarily large cost for the egalitarian welfare.
The exception is maximizing Nash welfare with 2 agents, for which we have a
finite price of fairness. There is still an unresolved gap between the lower and
upper bounds.

the results to other properties not discussed in this paper, and to investigate
other fair division settings, such as using chores instead of goods.

al. [2] that interpolates between these three kinds of welfare.
Bei et al. [5] also introduced the concept of strong price of fairness which
represents efficiency loss in the worst fair allocation instead of in the best fair
allocation. One possible direction would be to study the strong price of fairness
with respect to egalitarianwelfare or other welfare measures.
