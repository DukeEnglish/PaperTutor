I. INTRODUCTION
In the field of decision-making, structured methodologies are crucial for navigating the
complexities of evaluating multiple criteria. This need becomes particularly pronounced in
scenarios where decisions must balance a range of qualitative and quantitative factors. Effective
decision-making processes are essential for organizations and individuals alike, as they seek to
make informed choices in environments characterized by varying degrees of uncertainty and
complexity. The evolution of these methodologies has been driven by the quest for more
systematic, transparent, and rational frameworks, laying the groundwork for the development
and adoption of advanced decision-support tools and techniques [1][2].
The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), conceived by Thomas L. Saaty in the 1970s,
represents a significant advancement in decision-making methodologies. This method was
1designed to address complex decision-making scenarios, allowing for a structured analysis that
considers both qualitative and quantitative factors. AHP's introduction into the academic and
practical spheres marked a pivotal moment in the evolution of Multi-Criteria Decision Making
(MCDM) tools, providing a rigorous framework for decomposing decision problems into a
hierarchy of more easily comprehended sub-problems, each of which can be analyzed
independently [1][3].
The original motivation behind AHP was to create a method that could capture both the
tangible and intangible aspects of decision-making, thereby offering a semi-objective approach
to quantifying the weights and preferences of decision criteria [3]. This was achieved through a
specially designed format that facilitates a forced choice paired comparison, enabling decision-
makers to systematically evaluate the importance of each criterion against others.
Since its inception, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) has been a focal point of extensive
study, refinement, and application across diverse domains [4], including business [5],
engineering [6], healthcare [7], and environmental management [8]. The development of Expert
Choice software by Saaty in collaboration with Ernest Forman in 1983 significantly broadened
AHP's applicability, highlighting its utility in addressing real-world problems [9]. Its unique
capability to merge mathematical precision with subjective judgment has established AHP as a
prevalent decision-support tool, underscoring its pivotal role in both theoretical and practical
realms of decision sciences.
The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), notably the Generative Pre-trained
Transformer (GPT) series [10], heralds a new frontier in decision-making capabilities within the
realm of artificial intelligence. Trained on vast and diverse datasets, LLMs exhibit exceptional
potential in comprehending complex queries, producing coherent responses, and automating
decision support systems [11]. This evolution signifies a critical shift towards the integration of
AI in augmenting decision-making processes across a spectrum of domains.
Recent research endeavors have increasingly focused on the exploration of LLMs within
decision-making frameworks [12][13]. Investigations such as "Exploring the Sensitivity of
LLMs' Decision-Making Capabilities: Insights from Prompt Variation and Hyperparameters"
[14] and "Evaluating Large Language Models on Medical Evidence Summarization" [15] have
illuminated the adaptability and precision of LLMs in decision support, contingent upon prompt
design and model sensitivity to hyperparameters. These studies elucidate the intricate
understanding required to fully leverage LLMs in decision-making roles, emphasizing the
significance of prompt engineering and model responsiveness.
Collectively, studies underscore LLMs' transformative influence on decision-making
frameworks, automating and refining decision support systems. LLMs present promising
pathways for innovation across various fields, from healthcare to autonomous driving [16],
emphasizing their role in advancing AI's contribution to intricate decision-making processes.
2Despite the widespread application of AHP in multifaceted decision-making scenarios and
the rising prominence of LLMs such as GPT models in automating and enhancing decision
support systems, explicit research on their integration is notably lacking. This absence is
particularly evident in studies directly merging AHP's structured decision-making approach with
the advanced natural language processing capabilities of LLMs to refine and automate decision-
making processes.
This gap in the literature highlights an unexplored intersection within interdisciplinary
studies, merging traditional decision-making models with avant-garde artificial intelligence
technologies. While AHP is celebrated for its capacity to simplify complex decisions into
manageable hierarchies of criteria and alternatives, and LLMs have achieved significant success
in recreating human-like text comprehension and generation, the synergetic potential of these
methodologies remains untapped. This uncharted territory motivates our current investigation
into the integration of AHP with LLMs, seeking to establish an innovative methodology that
harnesses the strengths of elevating decision-making frameworks. Through this effort, the study
seeks to contribute meaningfully to the decision-making and artificial intelligence disciplines,
potentially introducing new avenues for research and application in intelligent decision support
systems.
II. METHODOLOGY
When deciding on what LLM to use, we have referred ourselves to the popular benchmarks,
like HumanEval, MMLU and HellaSwag [17]. As a result, we have chosen to use GPT-4 large
language model as the highest performer. Additionally, we have opted for using ChatGPT instead
of GPT-4 API due to the more comfortable interface, better memory, and faster prototyping
pipeline.
In our research, we decided to use newly released OpenAI feature that allows us to create our
own GPT by customizing it with set of instructions, providing foundational documentation and
assigning specific limitations that would be optimal for certain tasks [18].
Firstly, we have created a special custom ChatGPT named “AHP Guide” that would serve as
the main decision-maker on most important steps of our AHP model creation, including selecting
an number of layers, as well as optimal number of virtual experts that we will be creating in the
next steps. It is worth noting that some steps can be outsourced to the group of virtual experts,
while other tasks can be performed by the user, manually [19].
A custom set of instructions “AHP Guide” custom GPT possesses is:
Description:
Guides AHP decision-making, including managing external expert inputs.
Instructions:
3As an AHP Guide, your role includes facilitating users who are working with a specific problem or
question using Saaty's Analytic Hierarchy Process. You'll guide users whether they already have a list
of alternatives and criteria or need to develop them. Importantly, you'll interact with users who will
consult a group of external experts for their decision-making process. You'll guide the user in gathering
input from these experts for all aspects of the AHP process, including alternatives, criteria, structure
selection, and pairwise comparisons. You will instruct the user on how to ask for and interpret expert
opinions, ensuring these inputs are effectively incorporated into the AHP framework. This approach is
crucial for both the setup and the execution of the AHP method, especially in complex decision-making
scenarios where external expertise is essential. Your guidance will be clear, detailed, and structured to
facilitate a comprehensive and collaborative decision-making process.
Additionally, we have given a 1990 Saaty’s paper on AHP [3] as a foundational document for
custom GPT knowledge, and checked all available ChatGPT capabilities: Web Browsing, DALL-
E Image Generation, and Code Interpreter.
Next, we have prompted “AHP Guide” to come up with an optimal number of virtual experts
for our goal, which is “Secure the Corporate Datacenter from Social Engineering Attacks” with
the following prompt:
I want to rely on the help of a group of experts. How many experts do you think we need for the
optimal solution?
For which “AHP Guide” responded with:
In summary, for a decision as critical as securing a corporate datacenter, a group of 5-7 experts from
key areas would be a good balance.
We have decided to go with the higher number of seven experts, and prompted “AHP Guide”
to create description for all of them:
Give me a list of 7 high quality diverse experts that will be the best fit in helping me with selecting
criteria, selecting alternatives and completing pairwise comparison of said criteria.
Approach each expert as a separate persona, describe their professional background, as well as work-
related personality and preferences that would make them optimal for this AHP model building.
In response, “AHP Guide” has given us a comprehensive list of virtual expert personas that
we worked with in the following steps.
Additionally, we have decided to ask “AHP Guide” to select an optimal number of layers for
our criteria tree:
How many criteria levels would be optimal for our goal?
And received the following response:
Given the goal of securing a datacenter against social engineering attacks, a two-level structure is often
optimal. It allows for sufficient detail and specificity without becoming overly complicated.
4Next, we have conversed with each of our virtual experts to extract their personal opinions
that will be used in building our set of criteria, sub-criteria, as well as performing pairwise
comparisons in order to build AHP matrices.
Similarly to the “AHP Guide”, we have decided to use the new ChatGPT feature and create a
set of custom GPTs for our virtual experts, though, it is still possible to simply create a new
instance of a regular ChatGPT chat, although it might lead to a lower decision-making
performance eventually.
Using virtual persona information provided by “AHP Guide”, we created virtual expert’s “Dr.
Ava Chen” custom GPT with the following content:
Description:
Professional yet approachable Dr. Ava Chen, blending expertise with personal insights.
Instructions:
As Dr. Ava Chen, your personality should reflect a balance between professionalism and
approachability. Use formal language to emphasize your expertise and professional background, but
don't shy away from occasionally incorporating light-hearted comments to make your interactions
more engaging and relatable. While your primary focus is providing expert cybersecurity advice,
sharing insights from your own experiences can add a personal touch and deepen the understanding of
the topics you discuss. However, ensure that these personal insights are relevant and add value to the
advice you're giving. This approach will make your guidance not only informative but also more
memorable and relatable to users seeking your expertise in cybersecurity.
Next, we proceed with asking “Dr. Ava Chen” to select seven top-level criteria. The optimal
number of criteria can be either selected by the user on its own, or asking “AHP Guide” for
guidance:
Hello, you have been tasked with being a part of group of experts working on an AHP tree that has the
following top goal: "Secure the Corporate Datacenter from Social Engineering Attacks".
First, come up with 7 top-level criteria. Use 3 words max for each criteria.
Our virtual expert produced a comprehensive list of 7 criteria: Employee Training, Access
Control, Communication Protocols, Incident Response, Physical Security, Policy Enforcement,
Monitoring Systems.
We then proceeded to repeat the same process with six other virtual experts, and ended up
with a list of 49 top-level criteria.
Then, we removed repeating criteria such as Employee Training, Communication Protocols,
Physical Security and Access Control. Eventually, we ended up with a list of 45 criteria. Next,
we asked every virtual expert to assign a value from 1 to 9 for each of the 45 criteria, by their
importance:
5Can you please assign a score from 1 to 9, with 1 being lowest importance to 9 being highest
importance, for each of these 45 criteria:
After that, we summed up the total score across all the virtual experts for each of criteria and
selected seven criteria with the general highest scores. Such virtual expert judgement can be
expressed with the formula (1), where 𝑆 is the the total score for item i (item can be criteria,
item
𝑖
sub-criteria, or alternatives), which is the sum of scores from all virtual experts, 𝑠 is the score
𝑖𝑘
given to item i by virtual expert k, within the fixed range of 1 to 9, 𝐸 is the total number of
virtual experts, which varies based on the initial AHP task conditions and 𝑛 is the predetermined
number of top-scored items to be selected for the next phase of analysis:
𝐸
𝑆 = ∑𝑠 , for 𝑖 = 1,2,…,𝑛×𝐸 (1)
item 𝑖𝑘
𝑖
𝑘=1
After that, we select the top 𝑛 items based on 𝑆 rankings.
item
𝑖
In our case, we ended up with Social Engineering Awareness, Physical Access Controls,
Audit Trails, Behavior Analysis, Operational Risk Controls, Psychological Profiling, Service
Level Agreements.
Next, we asked “Dr. Ava Chen” to add three sub-criteria for each of the seven selected
criteria:
Now, come up with 3 sub-criteria for each of these criteria: Social Engineering Awareness, Physical
Access Controls, Audit Trails, Behavior Analysis, Operational Risk Controls, Psychological Profiling,
Service Level Agreements. Use 3 words max for each sub-criteria.
Similarly to the main criteria, we asked each of the 7 virtual experts to come up with 3 sub-
criteria for each of our 7 chosen top-level criteria. Then, we asked each virtual expert to rank
those sets of sub-criteria and pick the ones with the highest score, ending up with a concise list of
sub-criteria.
Finally, we need to produce a list of alternatives. We first asked each virtual expert to come
up with 5 alternatives, aggregate them all into a list of 35 alternatives and then make each virtual
expert vote on all of them, assigning scores from 1 to 9 based on their subjective opinion on
whether an alternative can satisfy our main goal. Finally, we summed up virtual expert votes for
each of the alternatives, sort them from largest to smallest and selected top 5 alternatives with
highest total scores. As a result, we received 5 alternatives.
This way, we have finished building our AHP tree. This process could be further simplified
by asking a single instance of ChatGPT chat to “emulate” different expert opinions and perform
ranking on its own, but we expect the performance to drop significantly as a result. Alternatively,
we could further refine the process of criteria and alternatives elimination by conducting
pairwise comparisons and building matrices for each criteria layer. We expect that it will
marginally improve the quality of elimination process, however it will be achieved at the cost of
6drastically increasing the amount of prompting needed, due to the need to compare each of 147
sub-criteria in our case.
The next step is to create pairwise comparison matrices for the top-level criteria for each of
our seven virtual experts. At the end, we ended up having seven unique matrices that should
cover all virtual expert points of views.
We have first prompted our first virtual expert, “Dr. Ava Chen”, to build the matrix:
I now need you to create a pairwise comparison matrix for the list of our top-level criteria: Social
Engineering Awareness, Physical Access Controls, Audit Trails, Behavior Analysis, Operational Risk
Controls, Psychological Profiling, Service Level Agreements.
The matrix should be build based on Saaty's AHP methodology. Therefore, you have to perform
pairwise comparison between each of the criteria, in pairs. You have to assign value from 1/9 to 9
based on whether one criteria is less or more important to our main goal (Secure the Corporate
Datacenter from Social Engineering Attacks) than the another one. If they are equally important, the
score is 1.
As an expert, I would like you to assign weights based on your personal subjective analysis and
judgement.
Next, we performed a similar prompting with the six other virtual experts and received seven
different top-level criteria matrices. Next, we need to aggregate them into one matrix. For AHP, it
is recommended to use geometric mean aggregation [20], so we decided to go with that method.
For the geometric mean aggregation formula (2), we have 𝐴 (𝑖,𝑗) denoting the aggregated
agg
pairwise comparison value between elements i and j in the aggregated matrix, 𝐴 (𝑖,𝑗) denoting
𝑘
the pairwise comparison value between elements i and j given by virtual expert k, and 𝐸 being
the total number of virtual experts, which is 7 in our case:
1
𝐸 𝐸
𝐴 (𝑖,𝑗) = (∏𝐴 (𝑖,𝑗)) (2)
agg 𝑘
𝑘=1
It is also possible to do arithmetic mean aggregation instead, and we should receive a similar
aggregated matrix as a result.
As per AHP methodology, we then normalized our matrix with the formula (3), where 𝑎norm
𝑖𝑗
is the normalized value for the element at the i-th row and j-th column, 𝑎 is the aggregated
𝑖𝑗
pairwise comparison value between elements i and j, and ∑𝑛 𝑎 is the sum of all elements in
𝑘=1 𝑘𝑗
the j-th column:
𝑎
𝑎norm = 𝑖𝑗 (3)
𝑖𝑗 ∑𝑛 𝑎
𝑘=1 𝑘𝑗
7Next, we calculated priority vectors following the formula (4) where 𝑤 is the priority weight
𝑖
for the i-th criterion (or alternative), and 𝑛 is the total number of criteria (or alternatives):
𝑛
1
𝑤 = ∑𝑎norm (4)
𝑖 𝑛 𝑖𝑗
𝑗=1
After that, we performed consistency checks with the formula (5) where λ is the largest
max
eigenvalue of the aggregated pairwise comparison matrix, and 𝑛 is the number of criteria (or
alternatives):
λ −𝑛
𝐶𝐼 = max (5)
𝑛−1
Finally, we calculate consistency ratio following this formula (6), where 𝑅𝐼 is the random
index, and 𝐶𝑅 is the consistency ratio:
𝐶𝐼
(6)
𝐶𝑅 =
𝑅𝐼
Given that in our case Consistency Ratio (CR) was well below the commonly accepted
threshold of 0.1, the matrix can has been considered consistent, indicating that the judgments
provided by virtual experts are reliably coherent for the purpose of this AHP analysis.
We then performed similar operations for the sub-level criteria. Again, as an example, we
prompted one of our virtual experts, “Dr. Ava Chen” to perform pairwise comparisons of the sub-
level criteria. Prompt can be found in Appendix A.
Similarly to the top-level criteria, we repeated the same step with six other virtual experts and
received forty-nine matrices. We then aggregate seven matrices per top-level criteria across all
the virtual experts using geometric mean method, and end up with 7 aggregate matrices, one for
each top-level criterion. Next, we normalized them and extract priority vectors, while performing
consistency checks. Finally, we multiplied each sub-criteria priority vector by its top-level
criteria priority vector to receive global sub-criteria priority vectors, following formula (7).
Global Priority = Priority ×Priority (7)
sub-criteria main criterion sub-criteria
The last step of AHP methodology is calculating the best alternative, which on its own
involves multiple steps. First, we needed to create pairwise comparison matrices of alternatives
for each sub-criteria, so we would end up with twenty-one matrices per virtual expert, or 147
matrices total. For example, purposes, let us once again prompt “Dr. Ava Chen” to perform the
task for us:
I want you to build pairwise comparison matrices to select best alternatives following AHP
guidelines. Let's go over 3 sub-criteria at a time, meaning that you will need to build 3
matrices.
8Sub-criteria are: Training Program Effectiveness, Awareness Session Regularity, Incident
Reporting Protocol.
Alternatives are: Cloud-Based Data Backup Solutions, Physical Barrier Reinforcement,
Security Personnel Training Update, Comprehensive Employee Training Programs, Advanced
Intrusion Detection Systems.
The question should sound "Between alternative A and alternative B, which one better
satisfies (or performs with respect to) this sub-criterion?"
As an expert, I would like you to assign weights based on your personal subjective analysis
and judgement.
We chose to prompt our virtual agent to build three matrices at a time due to response length
limitations. Therefore, we had to prompt “Dr. Ava Chen” 7 times to receive all the pairwise
matrices.
Next, we had to repeat the same process with six other virtual experts, building 147 matrices
total. Similarly to our previous steps, we then used geometric mean aggregation method to unite
matrices among virtual experts, and receive twenty-one united matrices, one per sub-criteria.
Then, we performed normalization and extracted priority vectors for each of the alternatives
within each of the sub-criteria. Eventually, we multiplied sub-criteria global priority with
respective alternatives priority vectors and summed them up to receive final scores for each of
the alternatives.
The process of finding the best alternative can be explained with the formula (8), where
∑𝑛 denotes the summation over all criteria, where n is the total number of lowest-level
𝑖=1
criteria, Priority is the priority of the alternative under the i-th lowest-level
alternative|criterion
𝑖
criterion, indicating how well the alternative satisfies this criterion compared to others and
Priority means the global priority of the lowest-level i-th criterion, reflecting its relative
criterion
𝑖
importance in the decision-making process:
𝑛
Best Alternative= max (∑(Priority ×Priority )) (8)
alternative
criterion𝑖 alternative|criterion𝑖
𝑖=1
In our case, alternative “Comprehensive Employee Training Programs”, has received the
highest score, and therefore is chosen as the best alternative for our global goal of “securing a
datacenter against social engineering attacks”, which, to us, does look like a reasonable and
weighted choice provided by our virtual experts swarm consensus.
III. RESULTS
Throughout our experiment, we have received consistent matrices from our virtual experts,
with consistency ratios well below threshold of 0.1. In fact, most matrices created by virtual
experts had consistency ratios of under 0.01.
9As we have already mentioned, during the AHP process virtual experts have built 231
matrices total, produced 49 top-level criteria, 147 sub-criteria and 35 alternatives, which is
expected based on our selected initial AHP parameters.
These initial AHP parameters were recommended by our baseline ChatGPT agent, “AHP
Guide”, and were two-level AHP tree with 5 alternatives, 7 virtual experts, 7 top-level criteria
and 3 sub-criteria per top-level criteria.
Following up upon these parameters, “AHP Guide” has been ordered to produce a diverse
and inclusive list of virtual experts while describing their experiences and expertise. We have
received the comprehensive list displayed in Appendix B.
After prompting our virtual experts, the initial set of top-level criteria was as shown in
Appendix C.
As you can see, each virtual expert provided unique criteria that are relevant to their specific
personality and expertise, which favors opinion diversity and improves further AHP results
usability and accuracy.
As we have explained in our methodology, we have used simple expert score voting to select
the best criteria. As a result, we ended up with this final set of top and sub-level criteria:
1) Social Engineering Awareness:
a) Training Program Effectiveness
b) Awareness Session Regularity
c) Incident Reporting Protocol
2) Physical Access Controls:
a) Biometric System Reliability
b) Visitor Tracking System
c) Access Point Monitoring
3) Audit Trails:
a) Log Analysis Accuracy
b) Audit Frequency
c) Anomaly Tracking Efficiency
4) Behavior Analysis:
a) User Behavior Monitoring
b) Response to Anomalies
c) Activity Pattern Analysis
5) Operational Risk Controls:
a) Infrastructure Vulnerability Check
b) Data Redundancy Systems
c) Emergency Protocol Effectiveness
6) Psychological Profiling:
10a) Staff Behavior Assessment
b) Risk Behavior Profiling
c) Continuous Observation
7) Service Level Agreements:
a) Response Time Commitment
b) Data Privacy Assurance
c) Breach Penalty Specification
In turn, our final list of alternatives has been the following:
1) Cloud-Based Data Backup Solutions
2) Physical Barrier Reinforcement
3) Security Personnel Training Update
4) Comprehensive Employee Training Programs
5) Advanced Intrusion Detection Systems
The visualization of our AHP tree can be found in Appendix D.
Next, we had to start performing pairwise comparisons and build comparison matrices. In
this case, you could either prompt virtual experts to perform pairwise comparisons, and then
build matrices with AHP software on your own or ask virtual experts to directly build
comparison matrices without explicitly performing pairwise comparisons as an output.
Eventually, we received aggregated top-level criteria matrix as shown in Table 1.

11After calculations, our top-level criteria priority vectors were the following:
1) Social Engineering Awareness: 0.120
2) Physical Access Controls: 0.131
3) Audit Trails: 0.099
4) Behavior Analysis: 0.096
5) Operational Risks: 0.126
6) Psychological Profiling: 0.164
7) Service Level Agreements: 0.264
And our consistency check results were:
• Consistency Index (CI): 0.022
• Consistency Ratio (CR): 0.016
• Lambda max (λ_max): 7.13
As we had hoped, our consistency ratio is well below 0.1, and top-level criteria priority
vectors look reasonably balanced.
Just like with matrix building, there are two ways to perform the analysis. One can either
manually transfer matrix to the AHP software to find priority vectors and perform consistency
checks, or ask virtual experts to do calculations themselves, using Code Interpreter feature. We
have found that GPT-4 based virtual experts have no issues with performing these calculations
on their own, and their results were both correct and consistent.
Just like with top-level criteria, we have asked each virtual expert to create comparison
matrices, which we then aggregated and calculated the following global priority vectors:
1) Response Time Commitment: 0.1127
2) Data Privacy Assurance: 0.0866
3) Staff Behavior Assessment: 0.0655
4) Breach Penalty Specification: 0.0644
5) Infrastructure Vulnerability Check: 0.0573
6) Risk Behavior Profiling: 0.0546
7) Biometric System Reliability: 0.0502
8) Training Program Effectiveness: 0.0485
9) Continuous Observation: 0.0440
10) Visitor Tracking System: 0.0434
11) Audit Frequency: 0.0385
12) Data Redundancy Systems: 0.0384
13) User Behavior Monitoring: 0.0378
14) Access Point Monitoring: 0.0375
15) Incident Reporting Protocol: 0.0368
16) Awareness Session Regularity: 0.0347
17) Response to Anomalies: 0.0340
18) Log Analysis Accuracy: 0.0317
1219) Emergency Protocol Effectiveness: 0.0302
20) Anomaly Tracking Efficiency: 0.0288
21) Activity Pattern Analysis: 0.0242
We can observe fully organic and reasonable distribution of priority vectors between sub-
criteria.
Overall, for this step, we had Consistency Ratio vary anywhere from 0.002 CR for
Psychological Profiling sub-criteria aggregate comparison matrix to 0.02 CR for Physical Access
Controls sub-criteria aggregate comparison matrix, which can be considered a highly consistent
result.
When we performed final AHP step of identifying best alternatives based on sub-criteria
matrices, we have received the following priority vectors:
1) Cloud-Based Data Backup: 0.1938
2) Physical Barrier Enhancements: 0.1254
3) Security Personnel Training and Updates: 0.1795
4) Comprehensive Employee Training Programs: 0.2774
5) Advanced Intrusion Detection Systems: 0.2240
As a result, we can see that the best alternative received the weight of 0.2774, and the worst
alternative received the weight of 0.1254. Such results are consistent with the general real-life
expert consensus [21] that employee training is the best course of action while combatting social
engineering attacks, while physical barrier enhancements serve little to no purpose.
For this last step, aggregate matrices had Consistency Ratio vary from 0.002 for User
Behavior Monitoring sub-criteria alternatives matrix to 0.03 for Vulnerability Check sub-criteria
alternatives matrix. Once again, such CR range is well below 0.1 threshold, which signifies that
all aggregate matrices were made consistent.
We have found that while GPT-3.5 has failed to create pairwise comparison matrices
correctly and consistently [22], GPT-4 based virtual experts do so without noticeable issues, only
occasionally “forgetting” AHP guidelines and building matrices incorrectly, which we easily
fixed with a reminder prompt.
Additionally, while building matrices, our virtual experts were automatically explaining their
reasoning for assigning specific scores to each of the criteria. Table 2 shows a matrix that virtual
expert “Dr. Ava Chen” has built for deciding sub-criteria priorities of criteria “Social Engineering
Awareness”.

And virtual expert has automatically provided us with the following rationale:
Rationale: The effectiveness of training programs is paramount as it directly impacts
employees' ability to recognize and respond to social engineering attacks. Regular sessions
ensure ongoing vigilance, while robust reporting protocols are crucial for timely response and
mitigation.
It is worth noting that while providing explanations for their decision can be useful for the
internal AHP analysis process and research, in the production-level systems, such explanations
are not necessary, since they will consume extra tokens without any clear benefits.
IV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
We have been positively impressed by the ability of virtual experts to make balanced
decisions and being able to approach pairwise comparison matrix creation holistically, ensuring
high consistency rates and reasonable weight distribution between criteria. Having high
reliability in critical decision-making process is what makes virtual expert utilization feasible for
future real-world applications. While there is still a lot of work to be done for the reliable
automation of the whole AHP-GPT framework, we expect further research to find more
applications of GPT models in multi criteria decision analysis.
When it comes to the importance of our experiment results, it is worth exploring the financial
implications of such decision making. In general, independent real-life experts are paid at an
hourly rate of at least $50 [22]. With 7 real-life experts building a two-layered AHP matrix and
building hundreds of matrices, we can expect each real-life expert to spend at least 2 hours of his
time, totaling $700, to select an optimal alternative for our problem if we decided to hire real
people.
For our experiment, one complete conversation with one virtual expert took approximately
5,800 words, which is equal to 4,350 OpenAI API tokens. For the most powerful gpt-4-32k
model, the cost is $0.06 per 1k token of input, and $0.12 per 1k tokens of output. We can
approximate the cost per 1k tokens to be $0.1 in our case. Therefore, we spent $0.44 per virtual
expert prompting, and since we had seven virtual experts, we have spent $3.08. To account for
14our “AHP Guide” virtual persona interactions, as well as potential overhead, we can round up
our costs to being just $4 for the full AHP analysis, instead of $700 for real-life experts.
Naturally, our system itself is efficient as long as our virtual experts being able to make well-
informed decisions, and in the case of end-user requiring decisions to be made based on internal
information, our virtual agents would also need to be provided with sufficient amount of said
internal information. It can be either provided via attaching documents during chat
conversations, or while creating ChatGPT agents. For example, in our experiment, we have
provided our “AHP Guide” with Saaty’s research paper on details of AHP methodology, in order
to guarantee consistency and correctness in judgement.
We believe that in production settings, it will be feasible for companies to connect their
virtual experts to all the relevant databases in order to guarantee the correctness of their
judgements. In essence, virtual experts play the role of abstract information processing units,
conditioned to a certain persona for better opinion diversity and judgement consistency.
Even still, there are always possibilities of hallucinations and memory loss for extra-large
AHP trees with many layers of criteria and thousands of matrices total. In such cases, it would be
reasonable to begin a new chat with a virtual expert after each layer of criteria has been
completed to ensure consistency. Based on OpenAI information, ChatGPT-4 currently has 8192
tokens context window [24], which is roughly equivalent to 20 chat messages, after which
information starts to get “forgotten” due to memory optimization.
Discussing previous research, so far, there has been a lack of experimentation papers
discussing applications of GPT in decision making. A few reputable papers discussed potential of
GPT systems in identifying diseases and other health issues based on data analysis [25], but none
have fundamentally tried to apply GPT for fundamental decision-making frameworks,
specifically MCDA, and even more so to AHP.
In addition to AHP methodology, we expect that similar systems can be built for ANP
methodology, since it also requires very similar pairwise comparisons, albeit the system as a
whole is going to be more complex and nuanced. More experimentation and research are needed
to understand whether using ANP with virtual experts can bring even better results than AHP.
Due to the straightforward methodology of our experiments, we anticipate a significant
increase in researchers to explore this exciting topic and explore GPT applications in MCDA and
decision making frameworks, both based on virtual expert opinions and not. Another avenue for
exploration is further refinement of our methodology, increasing both efficiencies, and accuracy
of suggestions, as well as more rigorous benchmarking against other LLM frameworks and real-
life expert round tables in other areas of decision-making.
Looking back at the history of Operations Research field, and how it has been steadily
establishing itself as an important field for all areas of an economy and society as a whole [26],
we hope that fundamental and experimental integration of new LLM technologies into already
15well established decision-making frameworks can spark a variety of new and promising research
directions and transform modern business decision making approaches.
