TornadoDrone: Bio-inspired DRL-based Drone Landing on 6D Platform
with Wind Force Disturbances
Robinroy Peter, Lavanya Ratnabala, Demetros Aschu, Aleksey Fedoseev, and Dzmitry Tsetserukou
Abstract—Autonomous drone navigation faces a critical
challenge in achieving accurate landings on dynamic
platforms, especially under unpredictable conditions such as
wind turbulence. Our research introduces TornadoDrone, a
novel Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) model that adopts
bio-inspired mechanisms to adapt to wind forces, mirroring
the natural adaptability seen in birds. This model, unlike
traditional approaches, derives its adaptability from indirect
cues such as changes in position and velocity, rather than
directwindforcemeasurements.TornadoDronewasrigorously
trained in the gym-pybullet-drone simulator, which closely
replicates the complexities of wind dynamics in the real
world. Through extensive testing with Crazyflie 2.1 drones
in both simulated and real windy conditions, TornadoDrone
demonstrated a high performance in maintaining high- Fig. 1: Composite frame illustrating key phases of au-

3) Training Protocol: The TornadoDrone agent training
protocol is meticulously structured to ensure an effective
learning progression. Using the stable-baselines3 Twin De-
layed DDPG (TD3) algorithm, the agent undergoes a rigor-
ous training regimen designed for complex and continuous
control tasks. The choice of TD3 was motivated by its

The policy employed is the MlpPolicy with an initial
learning rate of 0.0001. The agent was initially trained in
over5millionsteps,witheachepisodecappedat20seconds
to allow the agent to acquire the main behavioral patterns
necessary for landing. To further refine the agent’s capabil-
ities, including additional safety maneuvers and adaptability
skills, the model underwent retraining up to 35 million
steps. This extended training involved multiple iterations of
fine-tuning in both simulated environments and real-world
testing scenarios, enhancing performance in dynamic 3D
