Causal Influence in Federated Edge Inference
Mert Kayaalp, Yunus ˙Inan, Visa Koivunen, Ali H. Sayed
Abstract—In this paper, we consider a setting where het-
erogeneous agents with connectivity are performing inference
usingunlabeledstreamingdata.Observeddataareonlypartially
informative about the target variable of interest. In order to
overcome the uncertainty, agents cooperate with each other by
exchanging their local inferences with and through a fusion
center.Toevaluatehoweachagentinfluencestheoveralldecision,
we adopt a causal framework in order to distinguish the actual
influence of agents from mere correlations within the decision-
making process. Various scenarios reflecting different agent
participationpatternsandfusioncenterpoliciesareinvestigated.
