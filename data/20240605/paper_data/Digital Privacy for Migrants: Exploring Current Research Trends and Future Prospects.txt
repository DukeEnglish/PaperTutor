Introduction
Privacy is a fundamental right for every individual, but its significance amplifies for
marginalized populations who are often neglected in studies on privacy and security. Among
these marginalized groups are migrants, defined as individuals who relocate, often in search of
better living conditions, according to the Oxford dictionary [25]. An international migrant,
consequently, is someone crossing their country’s borders. The global trend of international
migration has consistently risen in recent years, both inabsolutenumbers andasa percentageof
the world population. In 2020, approximately 281 million people, constituting around 3.6% of
the global population, resided in countries other than their own [18, 36]. This rise is driven by
forcedmigration resultingfromarmed conflicts,naturaldisasters,and economiccrises [1].
Privacy and security concerns are particularly significant for migrants, who face unique risks
such as discrimination, exploitation, and physical harm when their personal information is
exposed [12, 33, 35, 37]. Migrants often encounter precarious situations during their journeys
and resettlement processes, making them vulnerable tovariousforms ofabuse andinjustice [12].
Understanding these risks is crucial to emphasize the potential harms and challenges they face.
Our paper explores digital privacy challenges for migrants, analyzing trendsfrom 2013to2023.
Migrants face heightened risks such as government surveillance and identity theft.
Understanding these threats is vital for raising awareness andguiding researchtowardseffective
solutions andpoliciesto protect migrantdigital privacy.
Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and analysisof keytrends,weuncovered
the complexities of managing digital identities and privacy concerns in migrant communities.
Our research highlights the need for tailored solutions and policies to safeguard the digital
privacy rights of migrants, considering their unique circumstances and vulnerabilities.Themain
1takeaway of our paper is the identification of significant digital privacy challenges faced by
migrant populations, along with potential avenues for addressing thesechallenges. Byexploring
this intersection, we aim to raise awareness of the unique challenges faced by migrants in
navigating digital spaces and to provide insights that can inform more effective policies and
interventions. Ultimately, our goal is to empower migrants to exercise greater control over their
digital identitiesandprivacy, fosteringinclusivityand dignityin thedigitalspace.
Privacy Research for Migrants
In 2022, Sannon and Forte emphasized the critical importance of studying privacy issues for
marginalized people due to the disproportionate harms they face when they lose their privacy
[31]. For instance, marginalized groups may face increased risksofdiscrimination, exploitation,
or even physical harm when their personal information is exposed. Addressing the unique
privacy-related needs and behaviors of marginalized individuals is for developing equitable and
privacy-protective technologies.
Migrants play diverse roles in the economic and social landscape, influencing local demands,
generating indirect financial flows, impacting human capital and knowledge diffusion, and
reshaping social norms [3, 4,27,33]. Technology,specifically Information andCommunications
Technologies (ICTs), is instrumental in the mobility process, as migrants rely on it for real-time
information and advice before, during, and after their migration journeys [27, 33, 36]. This
reliancehassparked interest andoccasional concern[33, 36].
Understanding the different categories of migrants isessentialwhendiscussing theirprivacyand
security concerns. According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM),
classifications such as immigrant, migrant worker, refugee, asylum seeker, and undocumented
migrant highlight the varied rights and protections these individuals may have. For example, a
migrant worker might have limited rights compared to an immigrant, who typically enjoys
most rights in the host country. A refugee has fewer rights but cannot be deported as long as
their home country remains unsafe. Asylum seekers have fewer rights thanrefugeesandcan be
deported if their claims are denied, while undocumented migrants usually have no political
rights or legalstatusand face significantchallenges duetostrict migration policies.
Despite researchers working on HCI and social aspects for migrants, few studies have explored
the privacy concerns and solutions for this population. According to Sannon and Forte, from
2010-2020 only 8.8% of work within the privacy and security domain for marginalized groups
was related to immigrants or migrants [31]. Other marginalized groups included people with
disabilities, women in patriarchal societies, victims of intimate partner violence, communities
and neighborhoods,and marginalizedindividuals ingeneral.

Other Marginalized Groups (2010-2020). This diagram was created by the first author
basedon the datashared bySannon and Forte [31].
The diagram clearly shows that even within this marginalized group, not much work has been
done for migrants. Therefore,withour work,weaim toidentify recenttrendsin privacyresearch

Methodology
In this research, we focused on discerning current trends in the field by comprehensively
reviewing papers spanning the periodfrom2013to2023,specifically addressing theintersection
of digital privacy and migrant experiences. For the collection of data, we conducted searches
using keywords such as “migrants and privacy”, “newcomers’ privacy”, “refugee privacy”,
“older migrants’ privacy”, and “digital privacy and migrant”'. We explored multiple digital
libraries, including ACM Digital Library, USENIX Security, Taylor & FrancisOnline,Springer,
IEEE Digital library,UNiLibrary,and HeinOnline.
Inclusion Criteria involved selecting papers published between 2013 and 2023 that addressed
digital privacy issues specifically related to migrants, newcomers, refugees, and older migrants.
We included peer-reviewed journal articles, conference papers, and relevant reports from
3reputable organizations. Our focus was on studies discussing the impact of digital privacy on
various categoriesof migrants, includingimmigrants,migrant workers,refugees,asylumseekers,
and undocumented migrants. Exclusion Criteria involved omitting papers not available in
English and articles focusing solely on general digital privacy issues without specific reference
to migrants. We also excluded publications that did not provide empirical data or substantial
theoretical discussion relevant to digital privacy and migrant experiences. Throughout this
investigation, our primary objective was to identify prevalent themes and existingresearch gaps
in the domain. We categorized these themes by engaging in a thorough review, summarization,
and reliance on key takeaways extracted from the reviewed papers. This process allowed us to
not only comprehend the current state of research but also pinpoint areas where further
exploration andemphasisare needed.
Limitations of our search process included the potential inadvertentexclusionof relevantpapers
due to keyword selection or database limitations. Our focus on specific keywords might have
overlooked studies using alternative terminologies for similar issues.Additionally,the exclusion
of non-English papers may have limited the scope of our review, potentially omitting valuable
insights fromnon-English-speakingregions.
By shedding light on the dynamics of digital privacy concerning migrants, our workcontributes
to a nuanced understanding of this crucial intersection. This understanding is enhanced by
recognizing the varied rights and legal statuses of different migrant categories, such as
immigrants, migrant workers, refugees, asylum seekers, and undocumented migrants, and how
these statuses impact their privacy andsecurity needs.For instance,refugeesandasylumseekers
may face heightened risks of discrimination and exploitation, necessitating robust privacy
protections.

understanding of privacy perceptions across diverse cultures and ideologies [4, 11, 21, 28].
Particularly noteworthy is the work by Schlesinger et al. [4], which explored the complexities
surrounding the disclosure of migrant identity. We have includedthis paperduetoits significant
relevance to the discourse on identity disclosure and its consequential impact on privacy
considerations.

8The following section discusses each theme, exploring their significant findings in privacy and
security research.
Theme 1: Social MediaandDigital Connectivity
The convergence of social media and digital connectivity significantly influences migrants’
experiences and integration. Researchers have explored this area, revealing both potential
benefits and challenges. Among them, Cesare et al. (2018) discussedthe potentialandpitfallsof
using social media data for demographic research, highlighting privacy concerns and ethical
implications [5]. Similarly, Dekker et al. (2018) examined how Syrian asylum seekers utilize
social media for migration decisions, emphasizing its role in information gathering and
decision-making while cautioning against misinformation [7]. Gillespie et al. (2018) explored
smartphones’ dual role in migrants’ journeys,servingas toolsfor navigation andcommunication
but also as potential surveillance instruments [9]. Kim et al. (2022) analyzed privacy risks for
migrants in digital communities, stressing the need for enhanced protections [14]. Leurs and
Smets (2018) underscored digital tools’ potential support for migrants but warned of
accompanying risks [17, 18]. Pyle et al.(2024) investigatemigrants’perceptionsof socialmedia
algorithms, revealing concerns about privacy and bias [27]. Monteiro (2022) highlighted social
media’s impact on migrants’ employment outcomes, noting both benefits and digital disparities
[22]. These studies underscore the transformative potential of social media in enhancing
migrants’ lives and facilitating their integration. However, they emphasize the need for policies
addressing privacy issues, combating misinformation, and mitigating digital inequalities to
ensure socialmediaeffectivelysupportsmigrants without compromisingtheirrightsandsafety.
Theme 2: InformationBehavior andICT Use
Understanding information behavior and the use of ICT is crucial for migrants’ adaptation and
integration. Researchers like Adkins, Hsiao, Suh, andLingelhave exploredthis areaextensively.
Adkins et al. (2020) highlighted the information-seeking patterns and digital interactions of
Latina immigrants in the US Midwest [2], while Newell et al. (2016) focused on information
seeking and technology use among migrants at the US-Mexico border [23], emphasizing
vulnerabilities due to limited access to reliable information and digital resources. Similarly,
Hsiao and Dillahunt (2018) explored how technology can facilitate immigrant access to social
capital and aid in their adaptation to a new country, emphasizing the role of ICT in fostering
connections and support networks [10]. Suh and Hsieh (2019) investigated Korean immigrants’
information behavior and ICT usage during settlement in the United States. They uncovered
unique patterns influenced by cultural and linguistic factors [37]. Lingel et al.(2014) and Aricat
(2015) examined transnational and low-skilled migrants’ online identity work, exploring how
they navigate digital spaces to construct and negotiate their identities across borders[12, 29].
Shankar (2023) looked into newcomer communities’ information practices and the
interdependence between caring for these communities and safeguardingtheirdata, highlighting
9the complexities of information sharing and privacy in migrant contexts [33]. Together, these
studies emphasize the diverse patterns in information behavior and ICT usage among migrants,
highlighting themultifaceted natureoftheir experiences.
Theme 3: PrivacyPerceptionsof Refugees,AsylumSeekers and UndocumentedMigrants
Understanding the privacychallenges confronting asylumseekers andundocumentedmigrants is
vital for protecting their rights. Steinbrink et al. (2021) conducted an empiricalstudy onasylum
seekers in Germany, shedding light on their digital privacy perceptions during their flight [36].
This work talked about the importance of privacy-enhancing technologies for this vulnerable
population. Guberek et al. (2018) and Vannini et al. (2020a) have exploredtheprivacy practices
and risks among undocumented immigrants, stressing the need to maintain a low profile in
digital spaces to mitigate threats and highlighting procedural challenges and privacy concerns
within humanitarian organizations serving undocumented migrants [39, 41]. In another work,
Vannini, Gomez, and Newell (2020b) proposed “Mind theFive”guidelines for data privacyand
security in humanitarian work, prioritizing migrants' privacy and safety [42]. These studies
underscore the nuanced privacy challenges faced by comparatively vulnerable migrants,
advocating for targeted interventions and policy measures to uphold their rights in digital
environments.
Theme 4: HumanitarianWork andPolicies
Humanitarian work with migrants requires a multifaceted approach that addresses legal,ethical,
and technological challenges while safeguarding migrants’ rights and dignity. Researchers from
sociology and human-computer interaction have explored this critical issue extensively. Among
them, La Fors-Owczynik (2016) studied Dutch identity management practices. Their work
emphasized the conflict between ensuring security through monitoring and safeguarding
migrants’ privacy rights [15].The significance of emerging digital infrastructures in border
control was highlighted by LatoneroandKift (2018), who emphasizedaccountability andhuman
rights concerns [16]. Similarly,Milanovic (2015) stressedtheneed toalign surveillancepractices
with human rights standards to protect migrants’ privacy [20]. Another work by Popescu et al.
(2022) focused on challenges and solutions for asylum seekers in higher education, advocating
for inclusive policies [26]. Vannini, Gomez, and Newell (2019) provide privacy guidelines for
humanitarian work with undocumentedmigrants, emphasizing ethicaldata handling [32]. Tranet
al. (2023) explore security and privacy trade-offs in migration processes, highlighting the need
for balanced approaches [40]. Finally, Warford etal. (2022) proposeaframework for at-riskuser
research, informing policies and interventions for vulnerable populations, including migrants
[44]. These studies collectively underscore the importance ofethical, rights-basedapproaches in
humanitarian efforts concerning migrants.
10Theme 5: Privacyand Security Vulnerabilities
Migrants and minority groups contend with heightened privacy and security vulnerabilities [25,
31], necessitatinga closer examination oftheirexperiences andchallenges. Previousresearchhas
focused ontheexperiencesof Muslim-Americanwomenandmigrant domesticworkers (MDWs)
in navigating digital landscapes, shedding light on their multifaceted vulnerabilities [3, 13].
Muslim-American women, grappling with complex identitiesencompassing religious affiliation,
gender, immigration status, and race, confront distinct online privacy risks, including
Islamophobic harassment and reputational harm withintheir culturalcommunities[3]. Similarly,
MDWs, often marginalized as passive subjects in digital privacy research, are revealed through
participatory workshops to face significant threats such as government surveillance and
employer monitoring [13]. McAuliffe et al. (2019) reflect on migrants’ contributions amidst
increasingdisruption and disinformation, highlightingtheevolving risksthey encounterin digital
spaces [19]. These findings underscore the necessity for inclusive security research,recognizing
broader social structures contributing to insecurity, and emphasize the importance of tailored
privacy strategies,including theestablishment ofsafe onlinespaces andutilization ofcommunity
networks. This underscores the significance of prioritizing the digital privacy needs of
marginalizedcommunitiesto fostermoreequitable andsecure onlineenvironments.
Theme 6: MobilePhone Useand Migration
Mobile phones play a pivotal role in the migration experiences of individuals, shaping their
access to information, communication, and support networks. There have been 3 significant
works that specially focus on the usage of mobile for migrants. the significant role of mobile
phones in the lives of newcomers, particularly migrants, as they establish themselves in a new
country [6, 29, 36]. Coles-Kemp (2018) et al. investigated the impact of mobile phones on
migrants’ experiences, highlighting how these devices can amplify pressures and reduce
capabilities in navigating new environments. Mobile phones serve as a source of security and a
means to create a safe space, allowing individuals to maintain connections with their pastwhile
navigating their new environment [6, 29]. However, this reliance on mobile technology also
brings forth a range of threats and vulnerabilities, extending beyond conventional security
concerns. Among low-skilled migrants in Singapore, mobile phone usage was foundtoenhance
their functioning, yet hierarchical structures and overdependence posed constraints to their
capabilities [29]. Similarly, asylum seekers in Europe utilize smartphones for information and
communication during their flight, but are acutely aware of privacy risks such as surveillance
and persecution[36]. This underscorestheimportanceof understanding migrants’digitalprivacy
perceptions and behaviors. The findings call for policies and support strategies that address the
specific needs for digital privacy protection among migrants, emphasizing the design of
assistance apps and collaboration platforms tailored to safeguarding their privacy and trust in
digital environments.
11Discussion and Future Work
The literature review and analysis of the discussed papers clearly indicate that there is much
more to be explored in this field. Our study highlights the complexities of digital privacyissues
for migrants and emphasizes the need for further research to address emerging challenges and
gaps in knowledge. By identifying key research priorities and outlining potential avenues for
exploration, we aim to foster a more comprehensive understanding of digital privacy issues for
migrants and facilitate the development of effective strategies and interventions to safeguard
their rights and well-being. This combined Discussion and Future Work section provides a
roadmap for future researchendeavors:
Double Presence:Navigating Onlineand OfflineIdentities
The concept of “double presence” presents significant challenges to the privacyof migrants[6],
encompassing bothonline andoffline aspectsof theirlives.Understandinghow migrants manage
these dual identities is crucial for addressing privacy considerations effectively. Future research
should dive deeper into the complexities of maintaining connections with both home and host
communities,particularly amongeducational migrants withdistinct mobile-centriclifestyles.
AddressingPrivacyConcerns in DevelopingRegions
Privacy concerns in developing regions, especially in the Global South and Africa, represent a
critical area for future research. Cultural nuances, knowledge gaps, and contextual factors
influence diverse privacy preferences in these regions. Exploring culturally embedded privacy
practices and developing inclusiveprivacypolicies tailored tolocalcontextscan offerinnovative
solutions toprivacy challenges.
Long-TermSettlement andMulti-Dimensional PrivacyConsiderations
The long-term settlement process of migrants entails a multi-dimensional understanding of
cultural adaptation,family dynamics,andday-to-day challenges. Future researchshouldexamine
privacy and security considerations during this intricate process, including intergenerational
issues facedbychildrenborn andraisedin newcommunities.
PrivacyConcerns of OlderMigrants
Privacy concerns of older migrants in new environments, particularly in navigating digital
connectivity challenges during old age, warrant further investigation. Research should focus on
designing user-friendly interfaces to facilitate continued connections with family members
abroadwhileaddressing the uniqueneeds of oldermigrants.
12Leveraging GenerativeArtificialIntelligencefor Digital Inclusion
Exploring the role of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in mitigating the digital divide
presents an intriguing avenue for future research. Investigating how generative AI can address
disparities in access and digital literacy, while considering privacy perceptions among
marginalized populations, is essentialfor ensuringequitable accessand safeguardingthesecurity
of migrant communities.
Conclusion
Our work offers a comprehensive exploration of privacy issues concerning migrants,
highlighting the critical need for in-depth investigation and innovative solutions tailoredto their
unique needs. It sheds light on theevolving landscapeof internationalmigration andthe integral
role played by migrants, particularly in integrating digital privacy into their journeys. The
literature review underscores gaps in existing studies, emphasizing the necessity for further
exploration into diverse aspects of migrants’ privacy experiences. Our identification of six key
themes in recent trends provides a foundation for future research directions. The outlinedfuture
prospects, including exploring the “double presence” issue, designing for privacy in developing
regions, studying long-term settlement processes, focusing on older individuals’ privacy
concerns, and using generative AI for digital inclusion, serve as a roadmap for researchers and
practitioners. Through these efforts, we aim to contribute to a more comprehensive
understanding of privacy dynamics among migrants, fostering equitable technologies and
ensuring asecuredigital future for all.
