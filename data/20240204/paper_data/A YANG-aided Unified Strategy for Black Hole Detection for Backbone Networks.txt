V. CONCLUSIONANDFUTUREWORK
In conclusion, our study represents a significant advancement in
detecting Black Holes in backbone networks. By innovatively apply-
ing YANG data models, we have developed a Black Hole-sensitive
Metric Matrix (BHMM) that not only improves detection accuracy
by 10% but also enhances PDR by 13%. Our approach effectively
addresses the long-standing issue of silent failures in ISP networks,
