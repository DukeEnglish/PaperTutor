        "summary": "Searching through chemical space is an exceptionally challenging problem\nbecause the number of possible molecules grows combinatorially with the number\nof atoms. Large, autoregressive models trained on databases of chemical\ncompounds have yielded powerful generators, but we still lack robust strategies\nfor generating molecules with desired properties. This molecular search problem\nclosely resembles the \"alignment\" problem for large language models, though for\nmany chemical tasks we have a specific and easily evaluable reward function.\nHere, we introduce an algorithm called energy rank alignment (ERA) that\nleverages an explicit reward function to produce a gradient-based objective\nthat we use to optimize autoregressive policies. We show theoretically that\nthis algorithm is closely related to proximal policy optimization (PPO) and\ndirect preference optimization (DPO), but has a minimizer that converges to an\nideal Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution with the reward playing the role of an\nenergy function. Furthermore, this algorithm is highly scalable, does not\nrequire reinforcement learning, and performs well relative to DPO when the\nnumber of preference observations per pairing is small. We deploy this approach\nto align molecular transformers to generate molecules with externally specified\nproperties and find that it does so robustly, searching through diverse parts\nof chemical space. While our focus here is on chemical search, we also obtain\nexcellent results on an AI supervised task for LLM alignment, showing that the\nmethod is scalable and general.",

        "summary": "This paper addresses the challenge of enhancing cybersecurity in\nBlockchain-based Internet of Things (BIoTs) systems, which are increasingly\nvulnerable to sophisticated cyberattacks. It introduces an AI-powered system\nmodel for the dynamic deployment of honeypots, utilizing an Intrusion Detection\nSystem (IDS) integrated with smart contract functionalities on IoT nodes. This\nmodel enables the transformation of regular nodes into decoys in response to\nsuspicious activities, thereby strengthening the security of BIoT networks. The\npaper analyses strategic interactions between potential attackers and the\nAI-enhanced IDS through a game-theoretic model, specifically Bayesian games.\nThe model focuses on understanding and predicting sophisticated attacks that\nmay initially appear normal, emphasizing strategic decision-making, optimized\nhoneypot deployment, and adaptive strategies in response to evolving attack\npatterns.",

However, they\nencounter significant challenges in the domain of moral reasoning and ethical\ndecision-making, especially in complex scenarios with multiple stakeholders.\nThis paper introduces the Skin-in-the-Game (SKIG) framework, aimed at enhancing\nmoral reasoning in LLMs by exploring decisions' consequences from multiple\nstakeholder perspectives. Central to SKIG's mechanism is simulating\naccountability for actions, which, alongside empathy exercises and risk\nassessment, is pivotal to its effectiveness. We validate SKIG's performance\nacross various moral reasoning benchmarks with proprietary and opensource LLMs,\nand investigate its crucial components through extensive ablation analyses.",

        "summary": "The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is transforming\ninformation interaction. For decades, search engines such as Google and Bing\nhave been the primary means of locating relevant information for the general\npopulation. They have provided search results in the same standard format (the\nso-called \"10 blue links\"). The recent ability to chat via natural language\nwith AI-based agents and have GenAI automatically synthesize answers in\nreal-time (grounded in top-ranked results) is changing how people interact with\nand consume information at massive scale. These two information interaction\nmodalities (traditional search and AI-powered chat) coexist in current search\nengines, either loosely coupled (e.g., as separate options/tabs) or tightly\ncoupled (e.g., integrated as a chat answer embedded directly within a\ntraditional search result page). We believe that the existence of these two\ndifferent modalities, and potentially many others, is creating an opportunity\nto re-imagine the search experience, capitalize on the strengths of many\nmodalities, and develop systems and strategies to support seamless flow between\nthem. We refer to these as panmodal experiences. Unlike monomodal experiences,\nwhere only one modality is available and/or used for the task at hand, panmodal\nexperiences make multiple modalities available to users (multimodal), directly\nsupport transitions between modalities (crossmodal), and seamlessly combine\nmodalities to tailor task assistance (transmodal). While our focus is search\nand chat, with learnings from insights from a survey of over 100 individuals\nwho have recently performed common tasks on these two modalities, we also\npresent a more general vision for the future of information interaction using\nmultiple modalities and the emergent capabilities of GenAI.",

        "summary": "This paper addresses a critical gap in legal analytics by developing and\napplying a novel taxonomy for topic modelling summary judgment cases in the\nUnited Kingdom. Using a curated dataset of summary judgment cases, we use the\nLarge Language Model Claude 3 Opus to explore functional topics and trends. We\nfind that Claude 3 Opus correctly classified the topic with an accuracy of\n87.10%. The analysis reveals distinct patterns in the application of summary\njudgments across various legal domains. As case law in the United Kingdom is\nnot originally labelled with keywords or a topic filtering option, the findings\nnot only refine our understanding of the thematic underpinnings of summary\njudgments but also illustrate the potential of combining traditional and\nAI-driven approaches in legal classification. Therefore, this paper provides a\nnew and general taxonomy for UK law. The implications of this work serve as a\nfoundation for further research and policy discussions in the field of judicial\nadministration and computational legal research methodologies.",
