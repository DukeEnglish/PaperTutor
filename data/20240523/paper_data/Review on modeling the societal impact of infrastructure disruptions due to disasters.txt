Abstract: Infrastructure systems play a critical role in providing essential products and
services for the functioning of modern society; however, they are vulnerable to disasters and
their service disruptions can cause severe societal impacts. To protect infrastructure from
disasters and reduce potential impacts, great achievements have been made in modeling
interdependent infrastructure systems in past decades. In recent years, scholars have
gradually shifted their research focus to understanding and modeling societal impacts of
disruptions considering the fact that infrastructure systems are critical because of their role
in societal functioning, especially under situations of modern societies. Exploring how
infrastructure disruptions impair society to enhance resilient city has become a key field of
study. By comprehensively reviewing relevant studies, this paper demonstrated the
definition and types of societal impact of infrastructure disruptions, and summarized the
modeling approaches into four types: extended infrastructure modeling approaches,
empirical approaches, agent-based approaches, and big data-driven approaches. For each
approach, this paper organized relevant literature in terms of modeling ideas, advantages,
and disadvantages. Furthermore, the four approaches were compared according to several
criteria, including the input data, types of societal impact, and application scope. Finally,
this paper illustrated the challenges and future research directions in the field.

11. Introduction
Infrastructure refers to assets, networks, and systems in the built environment that
provide essential services (e.g., energy, water, power, transportation, and communication)
for social and economic activities[1]. The terms “infrastructure systems”, “critical
infrastructure”, and “lifelines” are often used interchangeably, but there are some
distinctions among them. Infrastructure systems “whose reduced performance or disruption
would have debilitating impacts on the defense and national security” are regarded as critical
infrastructure [2]. Lifeline systems are those critical infrastructure systems that are
characterized by spatially extensive network structures [1]. In the field of hazards and
disasters, the term “infrastructure systems” is most commonly used; therefore, this paper
uses this term throughout. In addition, given the importance of infrastructure to the safety
and well-being of modern societies, different countries have defined and listed their
infrastructure systems, while the following systems are consensus: energy (especially
electric power), water, wastewater, transportation, and telecommunications systems.
Infrastructure systems are highly vulnerable to natural disasters, and damages to
infrastructure facilities could induce a large-scale disruption of essential services. According
to the World Bank report, natural disasters, such as typhoons (hurricanes), earthquakes, and
floods, are a leading cause of infrastructure service disruption, and most infrastructure assets
over the world are exposed to high-risk areas of natural disaster [3]. With the intensification
of global climate change and physical deterioration of infrastructure, the threat of extreme
hazards to infrastructure components or systems tends to be larger in the future [4,5]. In
addition, infrastructure systems typically comprise geographically extensive,
interdependent networks, which can improve infrastructure operational efficiency in serving
large populations, but the interdependencies of infrastructure would also increase the
systemic risk of infrastructure disruptions[2]. Numerous worldwide events have shown that
the destruction of one infrastructure component or system can produce cascading failure,
and cause disproportionately large-scale disruption of infrastructure services in multiple
systems and regions [6].
Infrastructure forms the backbone of a functioning society, and the disruption of
infrastructure services not only causes huge economic losses, but more importantly, it can
cause significant negative societal impacts, such as the disruption of individuals' daily
activities, the reduction of societal well-being, the occurrence of social panic (or even social
instability), and so on[7]. Infrastructure services are essential and ingrained in modern life,
for example, residents need portable water for drinking, electricity for household appliances,
transportation for traveling, etc.; therefore, infrastructure disruptions could affect all aspects
of people's lives, even threatening their health and survival [8]. With the continuous
development of cities, a larger population becomes increasingly dependent on infrastructure
services. Consequently, the societal impacts resulting from unexpected disturbances have
also becomes greater [9]. Examples of negative societal impacts of infrastructure disruptions
include:
⚫ Typhoon No. 15 (Faxai) struck the Kanto region of Japan in September 2019, leaving
2around 934000 and 140000 households without power and portable water, respectively.
Full restoration of the power and water outage in Chiba Prefecture took about two
weeks, during which more than 50% of affected households were unable to perform
daily living activities such as cooking, communication, night life, bathing, and washing
clothes [10].
⚫ Hurricane Maria (Category 4) made landfall in Puerto Rico of America in September
2017, severely damaging 80% of the electrical power system through strong winds and
floods, and leaving the island in a near-complete blackout. Less than 20% of the island’s
electricity was restored after one month, which made all communities suffered
enormously from power and water outages, especially for the vulnerable groups [11].
⚫ The Great 2008 Chinese Ice Storm occurred in the southern region of China, causing
widespread power system failure, which triggered the disruption of water supply,
railway system, medical service system, and supply chains, with direct economic losses
of up to 156 billion yuan. Millions of people suffered from these large-scale disruptions,
for instance, the disruption of the railway system was coincided with the peak of the
Spring Festival (high travel demand), and about 5. 8 million people were stranded in
railway stations alone, unable to return home [9]; the disruption of the supply chains
led to the shortages of food and escalation of food price in 11 provinces [12].
To reduce the risk of socioeconomic impacts from infrastructure disruption,
governments in different countries have developed several critical infrastructure protection
plans, and researchers from various disciplines have been involved in studying
infrastructure systems. The U.S. government issued the National Infrastructure Protection
Plan (NIPP), which outlines how government and private sectors work together to manage
risks and achieve resilience of infrastructure[13]. Similarly, Europe, Australia, Japan, China,
and other countries have also made efforts to better protect their infrastructure [2,14]. This
increased attention of governments attracts researchers from various backgrounds to study
on modeling and improvement of infrastructure. In the last 20 years, lots of innovative and
diverse work has been done on the vulnerability, reliability, and resilience analysis of
infrastructure systems[15–17]. Also, the interdependency between infrastructure systems,
which can lead to cascading failure propagations, has received increasing attention in the
last decade [18–20]. In summary, previous academic communities put more emphases on
the research of infrastructure systems themselves and contribute substantially in protecting
infrastructure. Actually, infrastructure systems are critical because of their role in societal
functioning, especially under situations that modern societies become increasingly
dependent on infrastructure systems. However, precisely how infrastructure service
disruptions impair society is poorly understood owing to the difficulties in quantitatively
measuring the societal impact and integrating it with disruptions.
More recently, the academic community has also recognized the importance of
exploring the societal impact of infrastructure disruption and begun to devote themselves to
research in this field. For example, Hasan and Foliente [4] reviewed the literature on
socioeconomic impact assessment methods of infrastructure disruption from the perspective
3of key stakeholders, but they mainly focused on reviewing economic impact models, which
were divided into Input Output model (IO model) and Computable General Equilibrium
model (CGE model). Chang [1]presented a comprehensive review of the socioeconomic
impacts of infrastructure disruptions and further clarified the definition, types, measurement,
and challenges of socioeconomic impacts of disruptions. Andresen et al. [21] conducted a
literature review related to the social impacts of power outages in North America, and they
emphasized understanding how power outages affected society and identifying the most
vulnerable populations to power disruptions. Those studies provided insightful reviews on
the contents and patterns of societal impacts caused by infrastructure disruptions; however,
they failed to deeply review the modeling approaches of societal impact, which can be
supported and complemented by the very recently cutting-edge literature.
This paper presents a review of the broad literature related to modeling the societal
impact of infrastructure disruptions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first review
that comprehensively explores the societal impact modeling of infrastructure disruption
from literature published over a long time. To establish a comprehensive repository of
relevant literature, this paper creates a repository using a two-step search method [22]. The
date range of the search and selection criteria was the period of the last three decades to
avoid missing important literature related to infrastructure. The first step was “Topic” search
to the Web of Science database. The topic of the relevant papers should contain at least one
keyword from two categories: (1) those related to disaster and infrastructure: infrastructure
resilience, infrastructure disruption, and disasters; and (2) those related to societal impacts
of infrastructure disruption: societal impact, social impact, community impact, well-being
impact, and socioeconomic impact. A total of 330 studies were found in the database. Then,
to include influential studies that not included in the Web of Science database, the authors
conducted a content-based search on Google Scholar using the same criteria and reviewed
the top 10% of studies ranked by relevance for each year [22]. A total of 186 studies were
selected. The authors then reviewed the titles and abstracts of the selected literature and
removed irrelevant literature (e.g., societal impact studies unrelated to disaster,
infrastructure disruptions, and quantitative modeling). The final number of selected papers
was 113 papers. The authors then summarized the reviewed studies according to two criteria:
1) measurements of societal impacts; and 2) modeling approaches of societal impact.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows and illustrated in Fig. 1. Section 2
introduces the definition and measurement of the societal impact of infrastructure, which
provides the theoretical foundation for the societal impact modeling. Section 3 reviews and
compares different modeling and simulation approaches. Challenges and research directions
are presented and discussed in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 provides general conclusions
and insights from the literature review.

2. The definition and types of societal impacts of disruptions
2.1 The definition of societal impact
Societal impact is the consequences of hazard-induced perturbations that can create
changes in all sectors of society [23]. In a broad sense, individuals, building environments
(e.g., buildings, infrastructure, facilities of factories, et.al.), institutes (medical service,
emergency service, financial service, et.al.), and interactions among people all belong to the
sectors of society due to the multidimensionality of society, accordingly, their changes
caused by disruptive events are societal impact. When narrowed down to the field of disaster,
the damages (or failures) to the built environment are usually regarded as the physical
impacts, which are further quantified by the monetary losses [24]. To separate from the
economic impact, the societal (or social) impact mainly refers to non-monetary outcomes
of disaster on individuals, social institutes, social interactions, and public safety [7,24].
The terms ‘societal impact’ and ‘social impact’ are often used synonymously and
interchangeably in the literature, though there are subtle differences between the two terms.
While societal impact refers more to the impact of perturbations on various levels and
sectors of society, social impact often refers to a more personal level of effects on individuals
directly or indirectly [23]. Andresen et al. [21] defined the social impacts of power outages
as the direct and indirect effects on people’s well-being or their physical or mental health.
Gardoni and Murphy [25] defined the societal impact of disruptions in terms of the impact
on selected individual capabilities, the functionings individuals are able, still able, or unable
to achieve in the aftermath of a hazard. At the same time, they illustrate that societal impacts
should broadly include the potential effects of a hazard upon the operation of economic,
social, political, and ecological systems within communities because impacts on those
systems directly affect the lives of individuals within affected communities [25,26]. Social
impact actually can be seen as a subset of societal impact. Given that infrastructure

4disruptions affect not only the individual well-being but also various social systems, this
paper uses the term “societal impact” throughout the paper.
This paper defines the societal impact of infrastructure disruptions as the changes in
societal functioning, which can be categorized into two groups: one is the social institution
impact, and the other is the individual functioning (well-being) impact. The detailed
description of types and influencing pathways of societal impact of infrastructure
disruptions are illustrated in Fig. 2 and discussed in Section 2.2.
Fig. 2 Illustration of types and influencing pathways of societal impacts of infrastructure
disruptions
2.2 The types of societal impacts
2.2.1 Social institution impact
Infrastructure disruptions compromise the operations of the very institutions that the
public values most highly in disaster situations, and some researchers take the change of
institution functionality due to disruptions as a proxy to denote the societal impact, such as
the reduced level of service of medical, emergency response, education, business, and so on.
Medical service systems (hospitals), which could provide treatments for the ill or
injured people, are critical for reducing fatalities and maintaining people’s well-being in the
aftermath of a disruptive event [24]. Hospitals may need to curtail health care service or
even shut down under disruptive scenarios of electric power, portable water, and
communication; consequently, the patient and injured people may not be treated in time and
people’s survival is directly threatened [1]. According to the social investigation in Alameda,

b e in g im p a c tresidents considered major hospitals to be the most important elements in the built
environment under earthquake scenarios [7]. Yavari et al. [27]and Chang et al. [28] denoted
the societal impact based on the reduction of health care functionality in regions considering
the failures of power system, water supply system, buildings, and personnel. In details,
health care functionality was assessed according to four classes: Fully functional, Functional,
Affected functionality, and Not functional. Similarly, Jasiūnas et al. [29] linked the socio-
economic aspects to power system disruption models, and utilized the medical service losses
as one of the dimensions to represent the social impact of power system disruptions; at the
same time, the number of employees in healthcare sectors without power was calculated as
a proxy of healthcare service impact.
Emergency service is usually organized and conducted by governments to prevent the
escalation of hazards, search/rescue people’s lives, provide survival-related humanitarian
relieves (e.g., food, water, temporary housing, et., al.), and the restoration of social functions.
Emergency services are very dependent on various infrastructure systems, without which
they can be impeded and indirectly cause the losses of human life and properties. For
example, fire-fighting requires a sufficient volume of water from the water supply system,
the emergency command and dispatch of resources (goods and crews) rely on the
communication system, and the delivery of survival-related relieves or repair workers
requires the functioning of transportation systems. Davis [30] defined the post-disaster
water system service categories, which incorporated the potential impact of water disruption
on society by fire protection. Yang et al. [9] measured the societal impact by considering the
emergency water supplies in shelters under the disruption of transportation system and water
supply systems.
Education service is the primary social institution dedicated to the transfer of
knowledge, skills, and values from one individual or group to another [24]. Various national
and international organizations recognize the importance of education systems to
communities’ stability and well-being, while education systems can be closed due to
disruptions in electricity systems (support educational computers, lights, projectors, et.al.),
water system (support the survival and hygiene of students or faculties), and transportation
system (support traveling to schools) under disaster scenario. Hassan and Mahmoud [31]
introduced the social services stability index to measure the impact of disruptive events on
community and focused on healthcare and education as pivotal services which is calculated
by aggregating the weight and their functionality changes over time. Aghababaei and Koliou
[32] utilized the reduced functionality of education systems, specifically, the reduced
number of student enrollments over time, to represent community impact given the
disruption of the electric power network and water supply network subject to tornado
hazards.
Businesses (economic institutions) facilitate the allocation of scarce resources across
society, in mechanism, businesses produce goods and services that fulfill the multi-
hierarchy needs of people, such as survival needs, career achievement needs, and social
belonging needs [24]. Businesses can be disrupted by hazard events in many ways, and
7several surveys in disaster-affected areas indicated that lifeline service disruptions are major
contributors [1,33]. Business interruptions would further cause sever socio-economic
impacts, such as like lost production and sales, reduced income, and unmet people’s needs,
etc. Aghababaei & Koliou [34] denoted the community impact of infrastructure disruption
by functionality changes in the education system, hospital system, and businesses. They
quantified the business impact by the cease operation day of businesses, unemployment rate
in regions, and number of absent employees. Nozhati et al. [35] considered the effects of
disrupted water supply systems, power systems and transportation systems on the
functionality of commercial facilities (stores or supermarket) to evaluate food security of
the society. Kajitani and Tatano [36] and Liu et al. [37] used the production capacity loss
rate (PCLR) as a measurable indicator to quantify the impact of disasters on businesses and
built the relationship between PCLR and disruptions of lifelines.
2.2.2 Individuals’ well-being impact
Individuals are the basic units that make up society, and the impact of infrastructure
disruption on society can ultimately be decomposed into the impact on individuals.
Substantial studies have illustrated that many aspects of individuals can be affected by
infrastructure disruptions, such as their physical health, mental health, daily activities,
quality of life, etc., and these impacts can be suitably covered or denoted by the well-being
impact of individuals.
Well-being is a multi-dimensional concept. Disciplines define well-being in a variety
of different ways, and one of the most widely cited definitions of well-being is as follows:
“well-being can be understood as how people feel and how they function both on a personal
and social level and how they evaluate their lives as a whole”[38]. In addition, well-being
can be grouped into different categories according to the emphasis and target of different
studies. For example, in terms of the domain of well-being, it usually encompasses physical
health well-being and mental health well-being of individuals or society. From the
perspective of measuring and analyzing well-being, it can be divided into subjective well-
being and objective wellbeing. The former describes an individual’s perceptions and
feelings about different aspects of their life and is measured by asking people “how satisfied
are you in your…” for various aspects of their life through social surveys, such as personal
health, happiness, life satisfaction, achieving in life, personal relationship and so on [39,40].
The latter (objective well-being) is concerned with measuring and analyzing the empirically
observable material conditions affecting the lives of individuals [39,40]. Scholars from
different disciplines usually propose some quantifiable indicators that are explained by
theoretical frameworks to characterize people's living conditions, such as the human
development index (income level, years of education, life expectancy, etc.) and the physical
quality of life index [41]. The popular theoretical frameworks may include the capabilities
theory, basic needs theory, primary goods, and so on. When focusing on the impact of
infrastructure disruptions on individuals’ well-being, it can also be grouped into objective
8and subjective well-being impacts (Table 1).
Different scholars have proposed various instruments to measure the individuals’ well-
being impact considering influencing mechanism of infrastructure disruptions, as shown in
Fig. 2 and Table 1. In the dimension of objective well-being impact, researchers mainly
from the engineering field proposed several indicators that are closely relevant to
individuals’ loss of service level (e.g., affected daily life and unsatisfied needs) to measure
the well-being impact. These indicators include deaths or injuries, dislocated people,
reduced capabilities, social burdens, unachieved daily activities, and unsatisfied needs.
Capabilities theory [42], welfare-based approach [43], and need-based theory [9,44] are
usually utilized to explain and verify the proposed indicators. In the dimension of subjective
well-being impact, researchers mainly from social science proposed several indicators
related to an individual’s negative perceptions and feelings about infrastructure disruptions,
such as the hardship experience, suffering level, and negative emotion. The
theories/theoretical frameworks behind indicators are usually proposed with the validation
by social survey in specific cases. Compared with subjective well-being impact, objective
well-being impact has a more detailed influencing path, for example, it specified the impact
transfer media (e.g., damaged house and shutdown facilities) and individuals’ interruption
of daily activity (e.g., drinking, cooking, bathing, and adaptive behaviors). On the contrary,
more influencing factors can be incorporated into subjective well-being impact
measurement attributing to the rich data in social surveys, such as the social vulnerability,
household needs, emergency preparation, social capital, past experience, and so on.

113. The models for societal impact evaluation
This section reviews the existing modeling approach for societal impact estimation
of infrastructure disruptions. They are broadly categorized into 4 groups: extended
physical infrastructure modeling approaches, empirical approaches, agent-based
approaches, and big data-driven approaches. The inputs, connecting methods, outputs,
strengths, and weaknesses of each type of approach are summarized in Fig. 3, and
details are illustrated in the following subsections.
Fig. 3 Overview of four types of societal impact modeling approaches
3.1 Extended infrastructure modeling approaches
Extended physical infrastructure modeling approaches estimate the societal
impacts by integrating the physical failure analysis of infrastructure systems
(engineering dimension) and change analysis of social systems (social dimension). In
engineering dimension analysis, the functionality and interdependency of infrastructure
systems are modeled in ways that support estimating the societal impact. Given the
social institutions and individuals are located in different spatial regions, network-based
models are usually adopted to calculate the spatial distribution of infrastructure service
disruption. In social dimension analysis, the susceptible sectors of society to

re sid e n ts is q u e stio n e dimportantly, the relationship between disruptions and selected indicators is established
to derive the societal impact. This type of approach advances in connecting the failed
infrastructure components with the societal impacts and enables modeling the
cascading failure of interdependent infrastructure-social systems. This approach is
widely used in community resilience or infrastructure resilience assessment that
includes societal consideration; usually, the societal impacts are quantified by social
institution impact and individuals’ objective well-being impact.
3.1.1 Extending method for social institution impact estimation
In aspects of social institution impact, the functionality of social institutions is
generally quantified and estimated by modeling the relationship between institution
functionality and infrastructure disruption, and their relationship is mainly established
by empirical data and logical rules. For example, Chang et al. [28]quantified healthcare
facility functionality considering lifeline disruptions based on damage data from post-
earthquake safety inspections of 228 facilities, and the functionality class probabilities
of healthcare facility would be adjusted up one level, if it experienced loss of at least
one external lifeline. Liu et al. [33] modeled the dependencies of production capacity
on lifeline disruptions in different business sectors using production functions that were
fitted using a dataset from a post-disaster business survey for the 2011 Great East Japan
Earthquake. While in most cases, the damage data are not fully recorded or even not
available, scholars established different logical rules to connect infrastructure
disruption to institutions' functionality. Jasiūnas et al. [29] developed an integrated
spatial rule for linking disruptions in a power system with critical service (healthcare
service), which were represented and calculated by accumulating the share of the
disrupted power supply through time and space, e.g., the average time that number of
people employed in health sectors without power. Loggins et al. [56] modeled the
interdependencies between civil infrastructure and social infrastructure (e.g., the police
and fire services, healthcare services, critical commercial services, etc.) based on setting
constraints that denote different effects of civil infrastructure on demand, supply, or
transshipment nodes in social infrastructure. Hassan and Mahmoud [57]established the
relationship between a hospital’s functionality and the disruption of infrastructure using
success tree, where AND/OR gates are used to connect the basic events (infrastructure)
to top events (hospitals) and intermediate events. A similar methodology has also been
proposed to model the functionality of education systems [58].
3.1.2 Extending method for individuals’ objective well-being impact estimation
In studies related to individuals’ objective well-being impact estimation, two types
of methodology are popularly adopted by scholars. One is identifying one or several
indicators that can mostly represent the individuals’ well-being impact of infrastructure
disruptions by expert judgment or practical experience, and then separately evaluating
it/them by mapping the disruption to the affected population. The other methodology is
applying the theory/approach used to measure the objective well-being of individuals
13in social science in the evaluation of infrastructure disruption (e.g., the capabilities
approach is the most popular theory to capture the well-being impact), and accordingly,
the connection algorithm between infrastructure disruptions and well-being impact are
developed.
(1) Extending infrastructure disruption to the affected populations
In Method (1), the number of populations without life-related services is usually
calculated to indicate the objective well-being impact, and logical rules and
households/individuals’ decision-making processes are designed to extend the
infrastructure disruption to societal impact. For example, Nozhati et al. [35] measured
the well-being impact of disruptions by the number of food-secure people, which is
estimated by the number of people who can access the functioning stores under
disruptive events, and food retailer is functioning only if its building structure, water,
and electricity are available. Yang et al. [9] defined the societal impact of water
suspension as the percentage of the population in each need satisfaction level, which
depended on the available water quantity in disasters, and the availability of tap water
(water supply system), bottled water (commercial stores), emergency water (equal
distribution rule) are modeled and integrated into each spatial population grid. Masoomi
et al. [46] quantified the socioeconomic impact by population outmigration, the
probability of which depends on state changes of households (affected houses, affected
students, affected employees) due to disruption and recovery of physical networks (i.e.,
electric power network, water network, and buildings). The above connecting rules are
determined by the way that infrastructure disruption affects people’s daily lives, and
they simplify individuals’ decision process (e.g., going to the nearest store, getting water,
out-migrating, etc.), which are the key to connect disruption with well-being impact
and are affected by multiple factors.
Individuals’ response or adaptive decisions under infrastructure disruption will
determine the availability of life-related services and further contribute to the well-
being impact. Scholars have proposed a logic-tree approach, discrete choice modeling,
and optimization approach to model individuals’ decisions. Chang et al. [28] modeled
the social impact of lifeline losses by displaced persons, and it was evaluated by a logic-
tree type of approach, which simulated the households' decision-making process
considering housing damage, lifeline loss, socio-economic and locational factors (car
ownership, elderly, ethnicity, tenure, etc.). The number of displaced people is a popular
indicator of social impact (social instability) caused by disaster [47,59]. Lin [60]
developed a dislocation choice model based on a logistic regression model, which is
capable of estimating the probability of households choosing dislocation considering
residential structural damage and multiple socio-economic factors. Based on this model
and Bayes’ theorem, Beck and Cha [61] estimated the dislocation probability and
expected dislocation population given the power outage probability of each node due
to hurricane damage. Similarly, Nofal et al. [62] integrated the dislocation model with
Housing Unit Allocation (HUA) method considering inaccessibility of transportation
14system and power system. This model could provide a dislocation probability for each
housing unit and aggregated dislocated population. In addition, Yang et al.[51]
measured the societal impact of water disruption by the number of people who can
perform certain activities and the number of people who get intolerant due to disrupted
activities, which are calculated using an individual’s activity estimation model driven
by minimizing the suffering of people’s disrupted activities under limited water.
In general, this method quantifies the well-being impact of infrastructure
disruptions by the number of daily-life affected people, which can be intuitive and
easily quantified without complex aggregation or other transformations. However,
these indicators were usually proposed by scholars’ practical experience, lacking of
underlined theoretical basis verifying them. The relationship between affected activities
and well-being impact is not clarified. In addition, logical rules and individual decision-
making models are developed directly to connect the infrastructure service disruption
to societal impact; thus, it is suitable to conduct scenario analyses and answer “what-if”
questions by combining physical infrastructure models. It is worth noting that the
spatial distributions of infrastructure disruption are usually required to derive the
affected population because, in different spatial disrupted regions, households with
different socio-economic characteristics may suffer inequitable impact. The
heterogeneity of populations should be considered, while the population characteristics
are statistically recorded in a relatively large scale, like the level of census or grids.
Recently, the HUA method has been established to link the detailed household
characteristics to a spatial inventory of residential housing structures, which further
narrows down the scale of the evaluation. Correspondingly, to generate the refined
spatial distribution of disruptions, network-based approaches are most popularly
utilized in societal impact estimation [1,63].
(2) Integrating infrastructure disruption with capabilities-based approach
Many theories or approaches are proposed by social scientists to measure the
objective well-being of humans, where the capability approach is widely applied and
integrated into the field of disaster or infrastructure disruptions. The capability approach
facilitates to answer two main questions: the first one is what is the true essence of the
objective well-being of individuals, including their measurement and relationship with
daily-life activities fulfillment (or other critical factors); the second one is how to
quantitatively estimate the well-being impact of individuals under disturbances.
The capability approach was first introduced by Amartya Sen in the development
of economics to gauge the well-being or quality of life of individuals as a way of
determining the overall level of development of societies[64,65]. The approach
emphasizes that the well-being of individuals depends on their capabilities to lead a life
that they consider valuable. To define the capabilities, they first introduced the concepts
of the functioning of individuals, which refer to doings(activities) and beings (states)
that individuals find valuable to do or achieve. Doings (or activities) may include eating,
15drinking, going to the hospital, working, etc., and beings (or states) may include staying
healthy, staying safe, staying happy, etc. Capabilities thus describe the genuine
opportunities or freedom open to individuals to achieve functioning (activities and
states), depending on the individuals’ available resources, characteristics, and social and
environmental conversion factors [66]. An individual’s capability is a collection of
functioning under certain conditions; the greater the individual's capability, meaning
that more activities in the collection can be achieved, the greater the freedom of choice
of life (functionings) available to the individual, and further the greater the well-being.
Murphy and Gardoni [67] first applied the capability approach to the field of
disasters in 2006 and defined and gauged the societal impact of disasters in terms of
changes in individuals’ capabilities. They pointed out that disasters can directly or
indirectly damage individuals’ living conditions and reduce their available resources,
leading to reductions in individuals’ opportunities to achieve functionings, i.e., some
daily activities and states of individuals are inadequately achieved or even disrupted,
which further reduces people's well-being [42]. In the last decade, the application of the
capability approach in the disaster community has become increasingly developed,
evolving from an initial theoretical framework, to qualitative evaluation methods, and
to quantitative evaluation methods applied to infrastructure disruptions.
In the quantitative estimation of the well-being impact of infrastructure disruptions,
scholars proposed a four-step indicator-based method founded on the capability
approach. In general, the method consists of four main steps [48]: 1) Selection of the
capabilities of individuals, this step identifies the specific functionings (e.g., drinking,
eating, traveling) that are critical and likely affected by infrastructure disruptions. 2)
Selection of indicators, because capabilities are not directly measurable, indicators for
given functioning are selected as proxies, such as the frequency of drinking water
supply problems, frequency of food supply problems, travel time to the nearest store,
etc. 3) Developing various models to predict indicator values, taking into account the
disruption of infrastructure, characteristics of individuals, damages of buildings, and
losses of other living conditions. In this step, regression models and infrastructure
network models are usually constructed using available data. 4) Establishing
aggregation algorithm for indicators’ values to represent the whole well-being impact
of individuals, and evaluating the levels of well-being impact due to disruptive events.
Based on the general quantitative estimation method, scholars from different
backgrounds continue evolving and improving the algorithm of each step. Steps 1) and
2) heavily rely on expert experience, literature review, or qualitative analysis (examples
are shown in Fig. 4), which are the main research topic of social scientists [68]. Step 3)
is the key to connecting the infrastructure disruptions with societal impacts, and
engineers usually put more emphasis on this part. For example, Tabandeh et al. [49] and
Wang et al. [68] developed a probabilistic prediction model and multinomial logit
regression model for indicator indices of functioning using social survey data, which
takes into account main influences factors, such as the status of infrastructure systems,
16personal characteristics, and resources. It is worth noting that the service statuses of
infrastructure are usually simulated or predicted under disaster scenarios through
developing physical infrastructure models, e.g., network-based mode [69,70]. As for
the aggregation of indicators in step 4), Tabandeh et al. [71] proposed a reliability-based
methodology that describes personal well-being as a series system consisting of
different functioning indicators, where a "failure" in any of the functionings (the
indicator value of activities is below a certain threshold) can lead to a "failure" of the
individual well-being system (the individual becomes intolerable). To determine the
“failure” threshold, Murphy and Gardoni [72] defined three states for indicator indices
with the same labeling as the capability states, i.e., acceptable, tolerable, and intolerable,
as shown in Fig. 4. When the level of activity achievement (indicator value) exceeds
the acceptable threshold, the individual is acceptable. A state below the acceptable
threshold is tolerable if its achievement is temporary and reversible, and above a
minimum tolerability threshold. The tolerability threshold is the absolute minimum
level of activity achievement below which the individual becomes intolerable. Besides
considering the achievement of functioning, Tabandeh et al. [49] incorporated the time
dimension in evaluating the indicator indices; for example, the tolerable state of the
indicator indices would become intolerable if the required recovery time to improve to
the acceptable state exceeds a reference duration.
Fig. 4 Selection of capabilities/indicators and their evaluation threshold [49]
In summary, Method (2) integrates infrastructure disruption with a capabilities-
based approach, which is an effective attempt to connect engineering dimension
analysis of infrastructure with social dimension analysis. This method advances in
providing theoretical foundations for the measurement and estimation of the objective
well-being impact of infrastructure disruptions, and it helps to clarify the relationship
between the achievement of activities (functionings) and the well-being impact of
individuals. Nevertheless, in the quantitative estimation methodology, the selection of
indicators for functionings (Step 2) is controversial in terms of whether they are
representative or effective. Additionally, in the evaluation of indicator indices (Step 4),
the acceptable and tolerable thresholds are usually subjectively determined, which
could cause a large bias on the evaluation results of well-being impact. Regarding this
deficiency, scholars proposed the concept of tolerable level (time) of households
quantified by social survey in subjective well-being impact estimation, which will be

3.2 Empirical approaches
Empirical approaches quantify the societal impact of infrastructure disruptions
according to historical disaster data and social surveys of individuals affected by actual
disasters, as well as surveys with hypothetical disaster scenarios. This type of approach
can develop an understanding of what happened in infrastructure disruptions, or what
could happen to disaggregate units, such as individual people or households, businesses,
and organizations; and their corresponding impacts are usually quantified by
individuals’ subjective well-being impact. Inequitable impacts of infrastructure
disruption to vulnerable populations and spaces are mostly highlighted, and their
potential influencing factors are identified and understood to promote human-centered
infrastructure resilience. In addition, based on empirical data, several vulnerability
models for individuals or households can be developed and embedded into
infrastructure or agent-based models to estimate the societal impact under various
infrastructure disruption scenarios.
3.2.1 Quantification of well-being impact and identification of its main influencing
factors
To understand what happened to people under infrastructure disruptions,
appropriate instruments should be proposed to quantify the well-being impact before
surveying individuals or households. As mentioned in Session 2, considering the
influencing features of infrastructure service disruption and measurability of people's
feelings or perceptions, scholars proposed several metrics to measure the individuals’
well-being impact, which can be categorized into (1) hardship experience, (2)
deprivation cost, (3) unhappiness, and other emotional well-being impact.
(1) Hardship experience
Quantifying the well-being impact of service disruption by the hardship
experience of households/individuals is intuitive, and the tolerance-level-based method
is widely developed by scholars to indirectly measure the hardship experience of
households or individuals. The tolerance-level-based method was first proposed by
Esmalian et al. [53] under the capability theoretical framework, and tolerance level
refers to the maximum amount of time that a household or an individual can tolerate
service disruption in disasters. They illustrate that hardship experience is a function of
the difference between the duration of infrastructure disruptions and the household's
tolerance level (tolerable time). The smaller the difference, the greater the people’s
suffering level; when the duration of infrastructure disruption exceeds the tolerance
level, people have hardship experience, resulting in negative well-being [73,74].
The key to this method is the introduction and quantification of the tolerance level,
which indicates an individual's or a household's ability to cope with and withstand the
disruption[53] . The tolerance level is mainly obtained by surveying individuals about
18the maximum number of days they can tolerate different infrastructure disruptions (e.g.,
power, water, transportation, etc.). The tolerance-level-based method improved the
application of the capability approach in the field of disaster and facilitated
understanding of the threshold of individuals’ functionings (Tolerability threshold) due
to disruption. However, this method did not directly measure the hardship of individuals,
instead, it regarded the hardship experience as a Boolean variable, meaning that people
experienced hardship when the duration of disruption exceeded the tolerance level.
(2) Deprivation cost
In addition to introducing a tolerance level to measure the hardship, scholars from
the field of humanitarian relief proposed deprivation cost to directly measure
individuals’ suffering level due to lack of life-supporting resources, such as water, food,
medical service, and sanitation supplies, where many of shortages are caused by
infrastructure disruptions. Deprivation cost is calculated by the economic cost, and it
was initially proposed to optimize the distribution of relief by minimizing the society’s
suffering level. Holguín-Veras et al. [75] first proposed the concept of deprivation cost,
and summarized the general characteristics of individuals’ deprivation cost function as
follows:
(a) Individuals' suffering level exhibits monotonically increasing, nonlinear, and
convex functions with the duration of disruption increasing, as shown in Fig. 5; these
properties reflect the body's natural response to deal with a shortage of life-supporting
resources. For instance, at first, most healthy individuals can handle short-term resource
disruptions, as the body's reserves of resources are used up, people's suffering level
surges rapidly until it reaches a maximum value (death).
(b) Individuals' suffering level has a non-cumulative nature of demand for
resources. Considering human physiology, the required amount of resources is not
cumulative as the duration of the disruption increases, e.g., when an individual has no
food for three days, his/her demand for food on the 4th day is limited and not the sum
of the previous three days.
(c) Hysteretic effects of suffering level may exist after needs are satisfied. When
an individual suffers a lot from shortages and causes irreversible damage (health
impairment) to the body, individual’s suffering level cannot return to its initial value
after his/her needs are satisfied and creates a residual impact. Conversely, non-
hysteretic effects mean that an individual’s suffering and body damage can be recovered
to its initial value after his/her needs are satisfied.
19Fig. 5 Schematic of deprivation cost function[75]
To derive the deprivation cost function, scholars developed economic evaluation
methods, such as the Contingent Valuation, Conjoint Analysis, and Stated Choice
method, which assign monetary values to non-tradable goods or services (e.g., suffering
level). Holguín-Veras et al. [76] applied the Contingent Valuation method to evaluate
the economic costs of individuals’ suffering level under water suspensions, and based
on a social questionnaire, they investigated people’s Willingness To Pay (WTP) to
improve the situation or buy a substitute resources in a hypothetical disruption scenario.
Also, the limit value was considered in the deprivation cost function, e.g., the point at
which an individual dies after five days of water deprivation, and by regression analysis,
an exponential function was fitted the best for the deprivation cost function. Similarly,
Stock et al. [55] measured the societal impact by households’ WTP to avoid electricity
and water disruptions. Although they did not introduce the deprivation cost function,
they also found the nonlinear relationship between infrastructure (outage duration) and
societal functioning (WTP) using survey-based data from Los Angeles County, USA.
Macea et al. [77] used discrete choice modeling to establish a deprivation cost function
of water disruption based on a social survey with questions about various hypothetical
disruption scenarios, and they found that the Box-Cox model fitted the function best.
Since the above studies did not consider individual heterogeneity, Macea et al. [78]
incorporate more factors into the deprivation cost function based on a discrete choice
model, such as individual attributes, risk perceptions, safety culture, and trust.
(3) Unhappiness and other subjective well-being impact
Dimensionless scales in social science or psychological science can also be
adopted to measure individuals’ physical and cognitive feelings (subjective well-being
impact) about infrastructure disruption, for example, the 5-point Likert scales, 11-point
numerical rating scale, and customized rating scales. Dargin and Mostafavi [54] utilized
5-point Likert scales, ranging from None at all (= 1) to A great deal (= 5), to measure
people’s subjective well-being impact of infrastructure disruption by hardship
experience and emotion changes, like helplessness, anxiousness, upsetting thoughts,
and depression. These impacts are derived by surveying the affected households and

easking them: “What was the extent of overall hardship/emotional impact experienced
due to lifeline outages/interruptions posed by disasters”. Wang et al. [79] introduced a
numerical rating scale (11 points) from the field of medical science to measure the
suffering level due to the shortage of food, medicine, and tent during disasters, and
similarly, asked people through social surveys about their degree of suffering when
faced with different scenarios (0 implies no suffering, 10 implies extreme suffering).
Stock et al. [55] developed two empirical measures of societal impacts: a WTP to avoid
lifeline service interruptions and a constructed scale of unhappiness, which has 5 levels
of unhappiness (from Not unhappy to Extremely unhappy) allowing individuals to
choose in a questionnaire. They found that unhappiness is better able to distinguish the
effects of shorter-duration outages than WTP is. This type of method has advantages in
understanding who suffers, how much is the subjective impact, and what is their main
influencing factors. However, in these studies, the measurement of subjective well-
being impact is dimensionless and relative, indicating that it is difficult to develop
mechanism-based model to estimate the impact, as a result, this method is rarely to be
used to conduct scenario analysis of infrastructure disruptions.
After determining the above instruments to quantify well-being impact, their
corresponding main influencing factors can be further explored by various statistical
methods, such as correlation analysis, ANOVA analysis, structural equation modeling
and regression model. For example, Esmalian et al. [53] implemented a Poisson
regression model to account for the simultaneous effect of multiple factors, and they
found that households’ need for utility service, preparedness level, the existence of
substitutes, possession of social capital, past experience, risk communication, race and
residence type mainly influence the tolerance level, and hence the level of hardship
experienced in the context of the 2017 Hurricane Harvey. With the same dataset,
Coleman et al. [73] adopted Spearman bivariate correlation analysis to understand the
association of sociodemographic characteristics with the hardship experienced and
tolerance level, and they concluded that certain socially vulnerable groups (low income,
racial minority, and younger residents) reported significant disparity in the hardship
experience. The same results were presented by Dargin and Mostafavi [80], and they
also found that disruptions in transportation, solid waste, food, and water infrastructure
services caused more significant well-being impact disparities. By applying ANOVA
one-way tests and structural equation model, Dargin et al. [54] found that physical
attributes of community, preparation behaviors, and the coupled durations of
infrastructure disruptions were significantly associated with household hardship
experience. Households’ poor preparation is attributed to past experiences and social
vulnerability, which refers to the households with children, racial minority status, and
low income and educational attainment, and they are prone to underestimate the impacts
of a disaster, or have greater barriers to preparing for disasters, such as relatively high
costs, lower accessibility to stores, lower availability of store supplies, etc. Stock et al.
[55] used survey-based data from Los Angeles County, and also found significant role
of preparation and durations of disruptions (power and water supply system) on
21households’ well-being impact. Differently, in Stock’s study, the effects of some
sociodemographic characteristics were not significant, like gender, race, education level,
and the household with children, partially conflicting with Dargin's findings.
Furthermore, Coleman et al. [81] collected survey data from Hurricane Harvey,
Hurricane Florence, and Hurricane Michael, and explored the main influencing factors
of the level of susceptibility for households by Spearman correlation analysis,
respectively. They highlight that some variation in the influence of factors was event-
specific or service-specific, but without doubt, certain influencing characteristics have
a universal impact on the well-being impact of households, e.g., households with low
socioeconomic status.
In general, the current researches establish a fundamental empirical basis for
understanding the households’/individuals’ susceptibility and well-being impact of
infrastructure service disruptions by identifying measurable instruments and their
corresponding influencing factors. They facilitate the development of mathematical
models based on the identified influencing factors to determine societal impact.
However, empirical studies heavily depend on the questionnaires and the backgrounds
of respondents, and their results are usually region-specific or hazard-specific, which
could lead to contradictory findings. The current consensus that can be reached is the
existence of social inequality in the well-being impact of infrastructure disruption, and
socially vulnerable groups are disproportionally affected under the same degree of
disruptions.
3.2.2 Empirical-based impact evaluation
According to survey data related to individuals’ well-being impact, an empirical-
based impact evaluation model can be developed to identify susceptibility for
households and to connect infrastructure service disruption with societal impact. The
tolerance-level-based method has advantages in modeling people’s susceptibility,
because it represents households’ capability to withstand disruptions (tolerable days)
and it can be easily transferred to people’s hardship experience (negative well-being)
by comparing the duration/recovery of the outage. Scholars from different countries
modeled the tolerance level of infrastructure disruptions using empirical survey data.
For example, based on empirical survey data collected after Hurricane Harvey,
Esmalian et al. [74] established a negative binomial regression model to predict the
tolerance level of households considering household characteristics (e.g.,
sociodemographic, social capital, resources, and previous disaster experience). By
integrating this model with existing models for power outages and service restoration
under an agent-based framework, the societal impact can be estimated. With the same
dataset, Dong et al. [82] proposed a Disruption Tolerance Index (DTI) for healthcare
service disruption using principal component analysis, and combining DTI with the
community’s physical vulnerability to access to healthcare facilities (transportation
disruption), they found the hotspots and cold spots of the physically/ socially vulnerable
communities. Based on post-disaster social survey data from Hurricane Harvey (2017),
22Hurricane Florence (2018), and Hurricane Michael (2018), analogous to fragility curves
for engineered systems, Esmalian et al. [83] developed susceptibility curves for
disruptions in eight infrastructure systems using survival analysis models, and found
that the proportion of households having hardship experience becomes larger as the
duration of the disruption increases. In addition to empirical studies in the United States,
Petersen et al. [84] conducted a social survey in the city of Barreiro, Spain, focusing on
the analysis of water disruptions, and examined the change pattern of tolerable
population over time under different influencing factors. In a Japan case study, Gentaro
et al. [85] modeled the probability distribution of tolerance levels for water-related
activities by conducting a social survey in Osaka, Japan, and explored the proportion
of the population that becomes intolerable with increasing disruption duration. They
found that tolerance level for disrupted cooking and toileting corresponded to the
lognormal distribution, while disrupted bathing and laundry followed a Weibull
distribution.
In terms of empirical modeling for deprivation cost function, as mentioned before,
scholars from the field of humanitarian relief adopted economic evaluation methods to
determine suitable functional forms, such as exponential function, Box-Cox regression
model, logistic function, etc. Yang et al. [51] introduced the concept and application of
deprivation cost function to the field of infrastructure resilience for the first time. Given
that both hardship experience and deprivation cost represent individuals’ suffering, they
integrated the tolerance level into the deprivation cost function to derive the suffering
level function for disrupted activities due to infrastructure disruption. Utilizing the
revised suffering level function, they proposed individuals’ decision-making model to
assessed the well-being impact of water infrastructure disruptions. As for the
unhappiness modeling, Stock et al. [55] fitted an ordinal logit with mixed effects to
predict probability of household at least each unhappiness level, as a function of
infrastructure type, outage duration, and household attributes. Dulam and Davidson [86]
applied this model into the case study of 1994 Northridge earthquake, and estimated
the spatial distribution of unhappy people.
Overall, Empirical-based impact evaluation model estimates the well-being impact
of people using statistical model based on survey data. In current studies, the tolerance
level is usually modeled and compared with outage duration of infrastructure to further
derive households’ susceptibility or well-being impact. At the same time, the empirical
study with tolerance level can improve the evaluation threshold of functioning in the
Capability approach. However, this type of method, as mentioned before, largely
depends on survey data and characteristics of society and hazards, and it can only
provide accurate estimation for future similar hazards or investigated places within the
range collected dataset. Empirical studies among different countries and various
hazards need to be strengthened and compared to develop widely accepted statistical
models. Also, other modeling and simulation approaches should be built and
incorporated for cross-validation or additional decision support.
233.3 Agent-based approaches
The societal impact of infrastructure disruption is a dynamically complex process,
and various coupled factors influence the negative impact, such as households’ and
governments’ protective behaviors, social vulnerability attributes, availability of
emergency resources, etc. To incorporate these influencing factors and simulate the
societal impact of disruptions, one effective approach is agent-based modeling, which
is a bottom-up method for simulating the complex system by designing multiple
individually autonomous agents and setting up their decision-making and interaction
rules. Agent-based modeling for societal impact is advanced in: 1) considering the
heterogeneity of agents (social vulnerability attributes) and modeling interactions
among agents and environments; 2) simulating agents’ nonlinear decision-making
behaviors (adaptive behaviors); 3) dealing with situations where data collection and
experimentation are difficult; and 4) allowing for rapid evaluation of policies/measures
and the incorporation of stochastic disturbance [87,88]. Based on these strengths, agent-
based approaches are increasingly used to simulate the impact of disruption on social
institute function and individuals’ well-being with consideration to multi-agents
adaptive behaviors.
3.3.1 Agent-based modeling for social institution impact
Agent-based modeling has been highlighted in the field of disaster for many years,
especially for flood risk management [89,90]. Scholars incorporate various individuals’
or emergency agency’s adaptive behaviors into disaster impact models to better
estimate the disaster risk or impact considering social responses, and more importantly,
to explore the effective measures to reduce the impact or risk of disasters. The adaptive
behaviors may include but are not limited to: individual agent’s evacuation, emergency
preparation, social mutual help, and buying insurance, and decision-maker agent’s
reinforcement of engineering structures, early warning, emergency responses, and
recovery strategies [89,91]. Similarly, in the topic of interdependent infrastructure
modeling, the agent-based approach is also proved to be a powerful tool to account for
various types of dependency, especially facilitating the modeling of the
interdependency of infrastructure systems and social systems, which are pointed as the
future directions by several related review papers [2,4]. After about one decade of
development, noticeable progress has been made in integrating disruptions of
interdependent infrastructure with social systems using agent-based frameworks. It is
worth noting that, different from the extended infrastructure modeling (Section 1), the
agent-based approaches put more emphasis on social dimension analysis. Specifically,
they focus on simulating the detailed functioning process of social institutions, dynamic
behaviors of individuals/households, and their interactions under infrastructure service
disruptions.
In terms of agent-based modeling for social institution impact of infrastructure
24disruptions, the institution is usually treated as the main agent, within which the
functioning process under disruptions is simulated by setting decision and interaction
rules. The decision rules can be designed by flow charts, discrete event simulation, and
heuristic algorithm, at the same time, the interaction rules with infrastructure and
household/individuals are always highlighted. For example, Aghababaei and Koliou
[32] proposed a comprehensive agent-based model for education systems, and the
model incorporates the behaviors and interactions of multiple agents: schools,
households, power systems, water systems, and construction companies. The decision-
making process of school agent is designed by a flow chart about whether to distribute
students to other operational schools according to the damage and recovery of buildings
and lifelines under hurricane disasters, which further affect the school status of students
of household agents. Also, households may move to other places for housing after
damages, reducing the student enrollments in the education system, and the housing
status of household agents is simulated by Markov chain model with consideration to
socio-demographic features of households. Based on this multi-agent model,
Aghababaei and Koliou [34] further added business agents and hospital agent, and
similarly, they simulated the fired-hired process of employees in business agents and
patient handling process using discrete event simulation in the hospital agent
considering the disruption and recovery of infrastructure. Correspondingly, the job-
hunting and injury treatment decision rule of household agents, as well as their
interaction with other agents are designed to comprehensively estimate the number of
affected employees and businesses. In addition, Hassan and Mahmoud [31] utilized an
agent-based model to simulate the functional processes within hospitals and schools,
and designed their decision‑making heuristics to maximize functionality under various
disruption conditions, such as using alternative staff, reducing patient treatment time,
using hospital backup, and facilitating student admission/transfer.
3.3.2 Agent-based modeling for individual well-being impact
In terms of agent-based modeling for individuals’ well-being impact of
infrastructure disruptions, the simulation scale and emphasis are different for estimating
objective and subjective well-being impact, though the people’s adaptive or response
behaviors are all incorporated similarly.
Compared to simulating the subjective well-being impact of disruptions, objective
well-being impact focused on a relatively large scale, e.g., individual’s changes of
housing, food, working, and other daily life, without modeling the mechanism of
individual’s emotion and cognition. For example, Costa et al. [92] focused on the
housing service of people under disruptive earthquake and designed the decision rules
for household agents’ temporary displacements and permanent relocations using flow
chart and heuristic algorithm, respectively. At the same time, the decision algorithms of
household agents take account of household socioeconomic demographics, social
networks, and disaster preparedness. Crooks and Wise [93] built a spatially agent-based
model to simulate people’s survival considering the government’s humanitarian
25assistance under disasters, and designed decision and interaction rules for two types of
agents: Food distribution center agent and Individual agents. The individual agents’
decision rule is driven by their survival needs, in the sense that individuals seek food in
centers to increase their body energy. The travel behavior of individuals and their
interaction collectively affect the performance of transportation. Agent-based modeling
is widely used to incorporate individuals’ travel activities to simulate road systems and
several large simulation tools have been developed, such as MATSim, ALBATROSS,
TRANSIMS[94]. Han et al. [95] applied MATSim to disaster scenarios and evaluated
the impact of a disrupted road network due to storm surges on residents’ travel activities,
including working, shopping, schooling, leisure, and others.
As for subjective well-being impact estimation using agent-based modeling, in
addition to individuals’ adaptive behavior, their cognitions or emotions towards
infrastructure disruptions are modeled by several methods, such as the empirical model,
cognitive models, and dynamic modeling. Esmalian et al. [91] built a multi-agent model
incorporating hazard agents, infrastructure agents, and household agents, to evaluate
the impact of power outages on society's well-being, which is based on the hardship
experience method. Households’ tolerance level and hardship status are simulated by
adopting empirical statistical models and setting decision processes. With a similar
multi-agent framework, Yang et al. [96] further improved the decision rule of household
agents to explore the negative well-being impact of disruptions (water, power, and
transportation) and effective countermeasures. They proposed heuristic algorithms to
estimate people’s achievement of activities and intolerant states (societal impact) with
limited resources (water and food) by minimizing suffering level, which is based on the
deprivation cost method. To estimate the available resources, they designed the decision
process of households conducting protective behaviors, such as going to stores and
shelters for supplies. Silverman et al. [97] explored the population well-being impact
of different healthcare interventions by building a three-level (individual, organization,
and society) agent-based model. In the individual agent, a cognitive model (called
PMFserv), including Motives, States, and Actions in appraisal loops, is developed to
capture the mechanism of individuals’ well-being impact. Individual agent’s action
decision is driven by satisfying their current state in a way that is consistent with their
motives, and the current physiological, mental, and socioeconomic states of individuals
contribute to the well-being impact. Valinejad et al. [98] developed a multi-agent-based
stochastic dynamical model to estimate the mental and physical well-being impact of
power outages and built an emotion (fear) dynamic model to explore mental well-being
changes by considering the variation of risk perception, information-seeking behavior,
flexibility, cooperation, and experience of individuals.
In general, agent-based modeling for societal impact estimation provides a
powerful framework to incorporate the adaptive behaviors and interactions of multiple
agents under infrastructure disruptions. This approach can improve the rationality of
societal impact estimation, as well as facilitate exploring the mitigation effectiveness
26of different policies/measures. The key aspect of this approach is designing the decision
rule for various agents, among which individual/household agents and institution agents
are the most critical ones. Several methods have been integrated to support designing
agent’s decision rule, such as state chart, discrete event simulation, empirical model,
and heuristic algorithm. It is worth noting that the simulation scale of an individual
agent can be further narrowed deep into cognition level, in that sense, the cognitive
model and emotion dynamic model can be utilized to capture the mechanism of human
subjective well-being impact. Agent-based approaches have the advantages of
developing a comprehensive agent-based model that incorporates multi scale and multi
agent to simulate social systems. However, due to the flexibility and comprehension of
the model, this type of method has the following shortcomings: 1) it is challenging to
calibrate and validate the developed agent-based model of social systems, because the
model usually includes many influencing coupled factors, which requires large or multi-
source data to calibrate variables. The simulation results of social well-being impact are
not easy to justify, and the measurement of the well-being of society is still an
undergone question in social science. 2) the simulation results depend on the collective
decisions and interactions of multiple agents, which are usually simplified and assumed
using various methods without theoretical foundation, and a small inappropriate rule
could induce different results. Addressing these challenges requires the cross-valuation
of different data sources and integration with different study methods, for example,
theoretical study, empirical study, and mathematical modeling. This future work will be
further discussed in Section 4.
3.4 Big data-driven approaches
Big data-driven approaches explore and quantify the societal impact of
infrastructure disruptions using the posts data from social media or mobility data from
cell phones. The social consequences of disruptive events could be influenced by
various coupled factors and challenging to capture, but with advancements and
applications of contemporary information technologies and networked communication,
human’s actual activities and behaviors during disaster scenarios can be directly
recorded, facilitating the analysis of societal impact patterns [99]. Specifically, this type
of approach is specialized in understanding the reality of the dynamic human mobility
across spatial-temporal scales and addressing the diverse needs of people under
disruptive events. Integrated with the demographic characteristics of the affected
population, social inequalities of the disaster impact can also be reflected. Furthermore,
utilizing the large volumes of data generated from people, quantitative models can be
established to sense the changes in human mobility (activities) and mental well-beings,
and further help decision-makers to implement dynamic disaster risk reduction
decision-making.
3.4.1 Societal impact sensing by social media
Researchers have recognized the importance of social media within disaster
management, and made efforts to acquire disaster situational awareness information by
27labeling disaster-related posts, geo-mapping the post, and conducting sentiment
analysis. Distinguishing posts related to disasters from irrelevant posts is the first step
for retrieving timely situational information from social media data. Disaster-related
hashtags are commonly used to filter related posts, and various labeling taxonomies
based on supervised learning are more informative, which can identify different types
of damages (affected individuals, infrastructure, etc.). By aggregating disaster-related
posts from the temporal dimension or mapping them from the spatial dimension, we
can capture the patterns of individuals’ posting activities and their correlations with
disaster intensities or damages [100]. It is worth noting that spatial mapping requires
location information, but only around 1%–4% of social media (e.g., Twitter) data posts
are geo-tagged [101]. To mitigate this drawback, geoparsing (or geo-tagging) methods
are developed to predict the locations of social media posts based on the content of the
posts and the users’ social network information [102]. Finally, sentiment analysis
focuses on exploring people's sentiments, attitudes, emotions, and opinions about
hazard events and facts, which are extracted from post contents by different supervised
machine-learning approaches, including bag-of-words, part-of-speech tagging, n-grams,
and keywords representing different sentiments [22]. Indeed, sentiment analysis can
directly reflect residents’ experiences and hardships in facing disruptions, and can
therefore capture the nature and extent of societal impacts [103].
Using sentiment analysis of social media to investigate the individuals’ mental
well-being impact during disasters has been extensively studied over the past years.
However, how to apply this technique to assess the disruptions of infrastructure and
their impact on well-being (experienced hardship) has not yet been realized, which is
also recognized as one of important future directions by Zhang et al. [22]. One category
of sentiment analysis studies is labeling the posts with positive, neutral, or negative
sentiments[104], while the other category refined the negative sentiment into fear, anger,
and others [105]. These sentiments are usually extracted from posts in social media
where the languages have been analyzed by machine learning (ML) or natural language
processing (NLP) techniques[106]. For example, Li et al. [107] analyzed emotions and
psychological states extracted from the datasets of Weibo users using linguistic inquiry,
and word count (LIWC). Valinejad et al. [106] measured community well-being impact
(social well-being and mental well-being) by the use of frequency of well-being-related
words in tweets during a COVID-19 period using machine learning and text-mining
tools (LIWC). These studies showed how the thoughtful application of simple NLP
methods can provide insights into specific mental disorders and health under disasters.
In recent years, several studies made attempts to apply sentiment analysis of social
media to infrastructure disruption. For example, Roy et al. [108] presented a multilabel
classification approach to identify the cooccurrence of multiple types of infrastructure
disruptions considering the sentiment toward a disruption—whether a post is reporting
an actual disruption (negative), or a disruption in general (neutral), or not affected by a
disruption (positive). Zhang et al. [103] proposed a semi-automated social media
analytics approach for Social Sensing of Disaster Impacts and Societal Considerations
28(SocialDISC), which enabled analysts to quickly capture emotional well-being impact
(societal impact) associated with infrastructure disruptions from residents’ reaction
posts in social media. They focused only on the six basic emotions: anger, fear, surprise,
sadness, joy, and disgust, and quantified the emotion score using the emotional lexicon
collected and curated by the National Research Council of Canada [109].
In general, individuals’ posts about disasters on social media could provide
valuable and rich information about the descriptions of and people’s reactions to
disruption events, which could support a timely assessment of societal impacts,
especially for the mental well-being impact by sentiment analysis. Compared with
traditional questionnaire surveys (empirical approach), the social media approach could
capture and analyze the time-sensitive societal impact information in a timely enough
manner without conducting time-consuming and money-consuming social
investigation. Especially, residents’ memory may fade after the disruption passes,
which limits the effectiveness of post-disaster survey, but social media could record the
most real-time responses and reactions of people at the moment of disruptions. While
the social media approach has lots of strengths, this approach still faces the following
challenges: 1) whether social media users are a representative sample of the residents
to reflect the whole well-being impact of the society is still not verified. As we can
expect, the young are more active to post in social media than the old. 2) the disparity
impacts among different social groups are difficult to investigate due to the data privacy
issue. How to connect the socio-demographic information with the posting users is the
key challenge. 3) identifying the location of the post is crucial in examining the spatial
heterogeneity of the impact, while existing geo-parsing techniques have limitations in
terms of the level of detail and level of accuracy for disaster situational information
retrieval tasks.
3.4.2 Societal impact estimation by mobility data
Human mobility data usually record temporal and spatial information of human
activities in a very detailed manner, allowing researchers to estimate people’s daily
movements and lifestyle patterns, especially their changes under disruptive events.
Broadly speaking, human mobility data not only refer to the call detail records and
global positioning system (GPS) data collected from smartphones, but also include
other types of location-based data, such as the data from subway smart card, credit card
transaction data, etc [99]. These datasets have been widely applied to solve urban
challenges, such as population density estimation, dynamic traffic flow prediction,
resource allocation, and modeling the spread of epidemics [110,111]. The applications
of mobility data to the fields of urban resilience and disaster management are relatively
limited, and they received more attentions in recent years. Several studies have used
mobility data to analyze people’s activity patterns before and after disasters [110,112]
Actually, the mobility of a community is a complex but important variable for well-
being [113], which could be holistically captured by the fluctuations of mobility data.
For example, if households are economically impacted by disasters, or if they cannot
29access businesses (social institutions) due to road disruptions, or if institutions are
closed due to damage, collective effects of these perturbations are reflected in changes
in human activity patterns. Therefore, mobility data analysis could provide an
integrative measure for examining the impacts of disruptive events.
Based on the mobility data, the societal impacts of the disaster are usually
indicated by individuals’ activity patterns and statistically calculated by the change
percentage of individuals’ POI visits or credit card transactions (CCT) to/in social
institutions under disruptive events. For example, Podesta et al. [111] used the digital
trace data related to unique visits to POIs in Houston during 2017 Hurricane Harvey, to
quantify the community impact, which is measured by the percentage drop of POI visits
(compared to its corresponding baseline over past three weeks). The POIs are divided
into four groups according to their functions supporting people’s activities: POIs
essential for: 1) emergency preparedness, 2) emergency response, 3) lifestyle and well-
being, and 4) recovery activity. Focused on the same disaster, Hong et al. [114] utilized
large-scale smartphone geolocation data to quantify the community impact by the
change percentage of people’s mobility activity before and after the disaster as well. In
addition to comparing to the baseline visits, Yabe et al. [115] quantified the business
impact (e.g., grocery stores, hospitals, hotels, restaurant, supermarket etc.) by the
difference between the observed daily visits under disaster and predicted daily visits
under counterfactual situations (what if the disaster did not occur?), which are predicted
by Bayesian structural time series model. Furthermore, CCTs data could be used to
quantify the societal impact of disruptive events. For instance, Yuan et al. [116]
quantified the community impacts by the maximum drop of CCT fluctuations of each
sector (e.g., grocery store, drugstore, healthcare, etc.) in 2017 Hurricane Harvey, and
they examined spatial patterns of disaster impacts by Moran I and gaussian regression
analysis. Similarly, Dong et al. [117] measured the impact of a series of social protests
on consumer actions (the number of customers) and personal consumption (the median
spending) based on the ten million CCT data.
Using mobility data analysis, substantial existing studies have found that the
societal impact of collective disruptions is not consistent across different spatial regions
and different socioeconomic groups. These unequal impacts across spatial regions are
relatively easier to identify using spatial statistics methods (e.g., Moran I), because
mobility data contain sufficient location information. Due to the anonymity of the
mobility data, it is difficult to connect the socioeconomic characteristics of individuals
with their digital trace, consequently, leading to challenges in analyzing the disparate
impact across various social groups. To solve this problem, Hong et al. [114] assigned
each ping location from an individual device to the corresponding neighborhood grid
cell based on its location, and each grid contains socio-demographic characteristics. As
such, the activity pattern among groups with different socioeconomic status can be
separately analyzed. They categorized these grids into 4 neighborhood groups based on
disaster response and recovery patterns by an agglomerative clustering algorithm, and
30found clear socioeconomic and racial disparities in resilience capacity and evacuation
patterns. This method aggregates people’s movement into one grid, and it cannot
capture their detailed activity patterns, such as visiting stores, healthcare, shelters, etc.
To overcome this weakness, using location-based data, Esmalian et al. [118] built a
population-facility network structure and dynamic clustering techniques to uncover the
disparate access to grocery stores for socially vulnerable populations. They highlighted
that disaster disproportionately exacerbated access disruptions to stores for socially
vulnerable groups in the context of Hurricane Harvey. Overall, most existing studies
focused on understanding and examining the unequal impact of disruptive events using
mobility data, while few analytical methods and tools are available to guide mitigation
measures in achieving equality and resilience goals. Fan et al. [119] attempted to
calibrate models using 30 million anonymized smartphone-location data to optimize the
distribution of facilities (stores), which is driven by minimizing the total travel distances
of the residential populations to facilities and maximizing the equality of access to
facilities.
In general, mobility data like POI visits could provide a holistic view of people’s
daily activity impact due to disruptive events as it captures population impacts, social
institution interruptions, and infrastructure disruptions together. Compared with social
media data, mobility data contain sufficient location and movement information of
people but lack information related to individuals’ opinions, perceptions, sentiments
related to disasters. Thus, Mobility data analysis is suitable to measure the performance
of social institutions and the objective well-being impact of individuals from the
perspective of mobility activity, and social media data analysis advanced in capturing
individuals’ emotional well-being impact. In addition, mobility data analyses have the
following shortcomings: 1) the location-intelligence data may not be representative of
an affected population; in detail, mobile phone and credit card usage are lower in certain
populations such as children, the elderly, the poor, and women [99]. 2) the baseline of
mobility pattern is usually assigned by pre-disaster conditions of activities (normalcy),
and external factors not related to the disaster impact would influence baseline mobility
patterns, such as major community events or celebrations; resulting in increasing the
bias of impact estimation. 3) Large-scale disasters may interrupt the power supply or
destroy mobile towers, resulting in a complete loss of functionality of mobile phone
networks, which may also cause data bias. 4) Existing mobility data analyses focus on
understanding the unequal impact of disasters by statistics and machine learning
methods, however, very few mathematical models are developed to conduct scenario
analysis: predict the societal impact or mitigate the unequal impact.
4. Discussion
Section 3 reviews different approaches on modeling societal impact of
infrastructure disruption. This section first compares different approaches with several
criteria, and then summarizes the research challenge and future directions.
314.1 Comparisons of approaches
There exist several comparison criteria in the literature to review different
modeling approaches. For example, Ouyang [2] compared the interdependent modeling
approaches by the quantity and accessibility of input data, types of interdependencies,
computation complexity, maturity, and resilience. Given our focus is on modeling the
societal impact of infrastructure disruption, this paper includes the following three
criteria to compare and discuss different approaches: 1) Quantity and accessibility of
input data; 2) Types of societal impact; 3) Application scope of approaches.
(1) Quantity and accessibility of input data
The quantity of input data for different approaches is categorized into three levels:
small, medium, and large amount of required input data. Also, considering the difficulty
of data acquisition, this paper ranks the accessibility of input data by three levels: easy,
medium, and difficult access of required input data. Based on these criteria for the input
data, this paper compared those approaches introduced in Section 3, as shown in Table
2. Overall, the barriers to conducting big data-driven approaches are the most
challenging, as the quantity of required data is large but difficult to access. In particular,
majority of mobility data and social media data are recorded by apps in smartphones,
which involve millions of users’ opinions or location data across time and space. Due
to privacy and confidentiality issues, these users’ data are usually not allowed to be
shared with the public, and only through research collaboration or high data collection
costs. Also, scholars need to de-identify the mobility data to conduct such studies. In
contrast, empirical approaches, which are usually involved with social surveys to
collect relevant data, have the smallest barrier to conduct compared with others. In
addition, although the quantity of input data in extended physical infrastructure
modeling approaches is at a medium level, its accessibility is very difficult. To extend
infrastructure modeling to capture its affected population (societal impact), the spatial
distributions of infrastructure disruption usually need to be modeled using detailed
information about components or characteristics of infrastructure, which are difficult to
obtain due to privacy and national security issues. Finally, Agent-based approaches
focus on modeling individuals’ behaviors and interactions, which usually required large
volume and multiple types of data to calibrate the parameters and validate the model.
(2) Types of societal impact
As introduced in Section 2.2, the societal impact of infrastructure disruption can
be categorized into three types: social institution impact, objective well-being impact
and subjective well-being impact. According to the classification of societal impact,
this paper compared the applicability of four approaches, as shown in Table 2. Agent-
based approaches can capture all three types of societal impact due to the flexibility of
this approach to model interdependencies of infrastructure systems and social
systems[2,120]. It is worth noting that when narrowing down the modeling scale, agent-
based modeling could simulate the cognition process of an individual to further estimate
32the subjective well-being impact under disruptions. Big data-driven approaches mainly
capture individuals’ well-being impact because the data source is directly from human
activities. Specifically, social media-driven and mobility data-driven analysis are used
for sensing subjective and objective well-being impacts, respectively. Additionally, the
extended physical infrastructure approaches focused on modeling the functionality of
social institutions and affected individuals under disruptions. It is capable of evaluating
the social institution impact and individual objective well-being impact, but it cannot
capture people’s subjective opinions about disruptions. This is a contrary situation for
empirical approaches because they focusing on collecting people’s opinions or feelings
through questionnaires and are mainly used for capturing individuals’ subjective well-
being impact.
(3) Application scope of approaches
By reviewing substantial literature, this paper summarized the application scope
of the four approaches into three groups: understanding the impact, scenario analysis,
and social sensing. Empirically-based approaches and big data-driven approaches are
mainly applied to understand the societal impact caused by disruptions. In detail, they
focus on proposing quantitative instruments to indicate societal impact, and then using
collected data to capture the societal impact pattern, such as identifying the main
influencing factors, finding out the influencing pathway, and examining inequality of
impact across spatial regions and social groups. Also, these two approaches are rarely
used for scenario analysis independently, and in most situations, they are combined with
other models to estimate/predict the societal impact of disruptive events. Extended
infrastructure modeling and Agent-based modeling are popular in conducting scenario
analysis and focused on establishing the relationship between disruptions and social
systems (institutions and individuals). These two approaches are capable of estimating
societal impact according to the intensity of hazards or extent of infrastructure
disruption, and examining the effectiveness of different countermeasures. However,
they have difficulties in capturing the inequity and disparity of the impact, which
require fine-grained modeling and incorporating the heterogeneity of individuals, and
agent-based models have potential to overcome this challenge. Finally, benefit from
collecting real-time data, big data-driven approaches can be utilized to sense the societal
impact information in a short-time manner after disasters.

4.2 Challenges and future directions
Based on the review and approach comparison in Section 4.1, this subsection
analyses the challenges and future directions of research in modeling societal impacts
in disasters, as follows:
(1) The measurement of societal impact
Scholars from different backgrounds proposed various instruments to indicate the
societal impact of infrastructure disruptions, like the functionality reduction of social
institutions, objective well-being impact (e.g., the number of individuals without food,
water, housing, healthcare), subjective well-being impact (e.g., hardship experience,
suffering level, negative emotion). There is a dearth of quantitative methods for
quantifying the social costs of infrastructure disruptions and integrating them into
infrastructure resilience assessments. In particular, in economic analyses of
infrastructure resilience investments, the limited consideration and quantification of
societal impacts would lead to underestimating the benefits of resilience investments
and infeasibility of resilience investments. Future studies should aim for specifying
empirical and quantitative methods for societal impacts/costs of various infrastructure
services to complement the existing subjective measures.
Also, there is no general theoretical framework to support the societal impact
measurement due to the multi-facet of society and the different purposes of studies,
especially for the individual’s well-impact measurement. So far, the capabilities
approach may be a widely accepted theory to support the measurement of societal
impact. Based on this theory, the hardship experience or suffering level of individuals
is developed to better understand the negative impact, and this is regarded as the future
34direction of this field. However, the relevant existing studies mainly concentrated on
the empirical study of the U.S., and future work could be extended to conduct more
empirical case studies in other countries to further improve the theoretical and practical
foundations of societal impact measurement. In addition, it is necessary to explore the
methodology of modeling the mechanism of individuals’ negative emotion, suffering
level, or well-being impact in future work, e.g., individuals’ cognition modeling using
agent-based modeling[121], dynamics model, machine learning method, deep learning
method. In fact, the ultimate goal of the future work is constructing a universally
recognized theoretical framework and computational instruments for the societal
impact of disruptions.
(2) Model integration and co-simulation
Different approaches have their own limitations and strengthens, and utilize only
one approach usually cannot achieve accurate and entire assessment of the societal
impact, especially for the application of scenario analysis. It is necessary to take full
advantage of different approaches and integrate them to improve the estimation of
societal impact. Empirical approaches advance in identifying the influencing factors
and pathways of societal impact, which could facilitate building the relationship
between disruptions and social systems. Extended infrastructure modeling is more
suitable to derive the spatial distribution of service disruption from the perspective of
individuals’ or institutions’ impact, thus, it can provide more accurate service
disruptions for societal impact estimation. Agent-based approaches are very flexible
and capable of simulating the decision-making processes of multiple agents
(individuals and institutions) by mathematical equations or rules. Thus, the Agent-based
model is suitable to be a unified framework that integrates all approaches; at the same
time, agent-based simulation requires a large quantity of data to calibrate some
parameters, which can be supplemented by other approaches. For example, big data-
driven approaches collected plenty of real-time data, which can capture the real opinion
about disruptions from social media, and the collective daily activity impact of
individuals from smartphones. According to the purpose of the research, different
approaches are encouraged to be combined to improve the accuracy of the societal
impact estimation, e.g., the capabilities approach and big data-driven approaches [113].
(3) Cross-validation of models
It is crucial to validate the results of approaches before putting them into practical
applications, while both the measurement and modeling of societal impacts are all
involved with uncertainties, which increase the difficulties in approach validation. Also,
attributing to the background or data accessibility restriction of scholars, existing
studies usually validate the result by other literature indirectly or by one data source.
However, considering the large uncertainties of societal impact estimation, it is
necessary to conduct a cross-validation process with multiple datasets to enhance the
developed model. Future work can be extended to combine empirical data from social
35surveys with the mobility data from smartphones under the same case study to validate
the measurement of societal impact. At the same time, these data can be applied to
cross-validate the results derived from extended infrastructure modeling and agent-
based modeling.
(4) Decision tools for mitigating inequity and societal impact
Substantial existing studies revealed the inequity in societal impact of
infrastructure disruptions, and highlighted that socio-economic vulnerable groups
suffered disproportionally under the same extent of disruptions. Yet there are few
analytic approaches to optimize decision-makers' measures to reduce or mitigate the
inequity of the impact. In fact, the extended infrastructure approaches and agent-based
approaches are suitable for conducting scenario analysis, which mainly includes
examining the effectiveness of various countermeasures on mitigating societal impact.
However, the countermeasures of inequity are rarely explored because the socio-
economic statuses of individuals are difficult to be incorporated into modeling, and their
influences on individual’s autonomous decision-making increases the modeling
difficulties. It is recommended to apply agent-based modeling frameworks to overcome
these barriers by population synthetics, HUA, decision rule designing, and coupled with
multiple data to validate.
5. Concluding remarks
Infrastructure disruption due to disasters could cause tremendous socio-economic
impacts, in the past decades, substantial emphases were put on modeling interdependent
infrastructure systems to better protect them and improve their resilience. As the role of
infrastructure system in societal functioning has become increasingly critical, in recent
years, scholars have gradually shifted their focus to study on understanding and
modeling societal impacts of disruptions, and substantial progress has been made. To
better comprehend the progress in current literature, this paper summarized the
definitions and types of societal impacts of infrastructure disruptions, and reviewed
quantitative studies about the measurement of societal impact, as well as their modeling
approaches in the literature. The societal impact modeling approaches are grouped into
four types: extended physical infrastructure modeling approaches, empirical
approaches, agent-based approaches, and big data-driven approaches. For each type of
the approach, this paper organizes relevant literature in terms of certain principles, such
as the modeling idea, advantages, disadvantages, and the application scope.
In Section 4, different approaches are systematically compared and discussed
according to three criteria: the quantity and accessibility of input data, types of societal
impact, and application scopes. These comparisons facilitate scholars in understanding
the characteristics, pros, and cons of each approach and then selecting appropriate
approaches for their research. Building upon these, Section 4.2 outlines the remaining
challenges and future directions in societal impact estimation, including the
measurement of societal impact, model integration, cross-validation, and decision-
36making support tools. By improving the understanding of societal impact quantification
progress in the existing literature, this review could provide an introduction to new
scholars interested in this field and facilitate the development of these modeling
approaches in disaster risk reduction, and further promote the resilient cities and society.
