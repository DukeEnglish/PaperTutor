Existing studies [42,49] have attempted to address these challenges by lever-
agingthepowerfulgenerativecapabilitiesofthediffusionmodels.However,these
methods necessitate full model training, resulting in significant computational
overhead,andtheyhavenotbeensuccessfulindeliveringsatisfactoryoutcomes.
Forinstance,FADM[42]refinestheresultsofGAN-basedreenactmentmethods,
which improves image quality but still fails to resolve the blurring issue caused
by large pose variation. On the other hand, DiffSwap [49] produces blurry fa-
cial outcomes due to the lack of background information during training, which
hampersmodellearning.Moreover,thesemethodsdonotfullyexploitthepoten-
tial of large pre-trained diffusion models. To reduce training costs, some meth-
ods [31,39] have introduced face editing adapter plugins for large pre-trained
diffusion models. However, these approaches primarily focus on attribute edit-
ingusingtext,whichinevitablyweakensspatialcontroltoensuretexteditability.
For example, they can only use five points [31] to control facial poses, limiting
their ability to control expressions and gaze precisely. On the other hand, direct
inpainting with masks of the face area does not take into account facial shape
changes, leading to a decrease in identity preservation.Face-Adapter 3
Toaddresstheabovechallenges,wearecommittedtodevelopinganefficient

els, specifically targeting face reenactment and swapping tasks. The design mo-
tivationofFace-Adapteristhreefold:(1)FullydisentangledID,targetstructure,
and attribute control enable a ’one-model-two-tasks’ approach; (2) Addressing
overlooked issues; (3) Simple yet effective, plug and play. Specifically, the pro-
posed Face-Adapter comprises three components: 1) Spatial Condition Genera-
tor (SCG in Sec. 3.1) is designed to automatically predict 3D prior landmarks
and the mask of the varying foreground area, which provides more reasonable
and precise guidance for subsequent controlled generation. In addition, for face
reenactment, this strategy mitigates potential problems that could occur when
only extracting the background from the source image, such as inconsistencies
causedbyalterationsinthetargetbackgroundduetothemovementofthecam-
eraorfaceobjects;Forfaceswapping,themodellearnstomaintainbackground
consistency, glean clues about global lighting and spatial reference, and try to
generate content in harmony with the background. 2) Identity Encoder (IE in
Sec. 3.2) uses the pre-trained recognition model to extract face embeddings and
then transfers them to the text space by learnable queries from the transformer
decoder.Thismannergreatlyimprovestheidentityconsistencyofthegenerated
images. 3) Attribute Controller (AC in Sec. 3.3) includes two sub-modules: The
spatial control combines the landmarks of target motion with the unchanged
background obtained from the Spatial Condition Generator. The attribute tem-
plate supplements the absent attribute, encompassing lighting, a portion of the
background, and hair. Both two tasks can be perceived as a procedure that exe-
cutesconditionalinpainting,utilizingtheprovidedidentityandabsentattribute
content. This process adheres to the stipulations of the given spatial control,
attaining congruity and harmony with the background. Our contributions can
be summarized as follows:
– We introduce Face-Adapter, a lightweight facial editing adapter designed to
facilitateprecisecontroloveridentityandattributesforpre-traineddiffusion
models. This adapter efficiently and proficiently tackles face reenactment
and swapping tasks, surpassing previous state-of-the-art GAN-based and
diffusion-based methods.
– We propose a novel Spatial Condition Generator module to predict the req-
uisite generation areas, collaborating with the Identity Encoder and At-
tribute Controller to frame reenactment and swapping tasks as conditional
inpaintingwithsufficientspatialguidance,identity,andessentialattributes.
Through reasonable and highly decoupled condition designs, we unleash the
generative capabilities of pre-trained diffusion models for both tasks.
– Face-Adapterservesasatraining-efficient,plug-and-play,face-specificadapter

Face Reeactment involves extracting motion from a human face and transfer-
ring it to another face [1,3,22,28,35,38,43–45], which can be broadly divided
into warping-based and 3DMM-based methods. Warping-based methods [14,15,
28,29,32,48]typicallyextractlandmarksorregionpairstoestimatemotionfields
and perform warping on the feature maps to transfer motions. When dealing
with large motion variations, these methods tend to produce blurry and dis-

HEAT is limited by the dataset of frontal portraits, while HyperReenact suffers
from resolution constraints and background blurring. To further improve gen-
eration quality, diffusion models have gained popularity. FADM [42] combines
the previous reenactment model with diffusion refinements but the base model
limits the driving accuracy. Recently, AnimateAnyone [17] employs heavy tex-
ture representation encoders (CLIP and a copy of U-Net) to ensure the textural
quality of animated results, but this manner is costly. In contrast, we aim to

Face Swapping aims to transfer the facial identity of the source image to the
target image, with other attributes (i.e., lighting, hair, background, and mo-
tion) of the target image unchanged. Recent methods can be broadly classified
into GAN-based and diffusion-based approaches. 1) Most GAN-based meth-

sential attributes (e.g., lighting, a portion of the background, and hair) based
on the target motion (e.g., pose, expression, and gaze).
3.1 Spatial Condition Generator
To provide more reasonable and precise guidance for subsequent controlled gen-
eration, we design a novel Spatial Condition Generator (SCG) to automatically
predict 3D prior landmarks and the mask of the varying foreground area. In
detail, this component consists of two sub-modules:
3D Landmark Projector. To surmount alterations in facial shape, we utilize
a 3D facial reconstruction method [8] to extract the identity, expression indi-
vidually and pose coefficients of the source and target faces. Subsequently, we
recombine the identity coefficients of the source with the expression and pose
coefficients of the target, reconstruct a new 3D face, and project it to acquire
the corresponding landmarks.
Adapting Area Predictor. For face reenactment, prior methods assume that
only the subject is in motion, while the background remains static in the train-
ing data. However, we observe that the background actually undergoes changes,
encompassing the movement of both the camera and objects in the background,
as illustrated in Fig. 3. If the model lacks knowledge of the background motion
duringtraining,itwilllearntogenerateablurrybackground.Forfaceswapping,
supplying the target background can also give the model clues about environ-
mental lighting and spatial references. This added constraint of the background

Thus, we provide the background of the target image in the spatial condition during

Inviewoftheabove,weintroducealightweightAdaptingAreaPredictorfor
both face reenactment and swapping, automatically predicting the region the
model needs to generate (the adapting area) while maintaining the remaining
area unchanged. For face reenactment, the adapting area constitutes the region
occupied by the source image head before and after reenactment. We train aFace-Adapter 7

3.2 Identity Encoder
AsdemonstratedbyIP-Adapter-FaceID[39]andInstantID[31],ahigh-levelface
embedding can ensure more robust identity preservation. As we observed, there
is no need for heavy texture encoders [17] or additional identity networks [31]
in face reenactment/swapping. By merely tuning a lightweight mapping module
to map the face embedding into the fixed textual space, identity preservation
is guaranteed. Specifically, given a face image IS, the face embedding f is
id
obtained by a pre-trained face recognition model E [7]. Subsequently, a three-
id
layer transformer decoder ϕ is employed to project the face embedding f
dec id
into the fixed text semantic space of the pre-trained diffusion model, obtaining
the identity tokens. The specified number N (we set N = 77 in this paper) of
learnable queries q = {q ,q ,··· ,q } in the transformer decoder constrains

the sequence length of the identity embedding, ensuring it does not exceed the
maximum length of the text embedding. Through this approach, the U-Net of
the pre-trained diffusion model does not require any fine-tuning to adapt to the
face embedding.
3.3 Attribute Controller
Spatial Control. In line with ControlNet [46], we create a copy of U-Net ϕ

3.4 Strategies for Boosting Performance
Training. 1) Data Stream: For both reenactment and face-swapping tasks, we
usetwoimagesofthesamepersonindifferentposesassourceandtargetimages.
To support a “one model for both task” approach, we use a 50% probability to
choose between reenactment and face-swapping data streams during training,
i.e., the spatial control and attribute template in the Attribute Controller use
the data streams indicated by red and blue respectively. 2) Condition Dropping
for Classifier-free Guidance: The conditions we need to drop include identity
tokensandattributetokensinputintotheU-NetandControlNetcross-attention.
We use a 5% probability to simultaneously drop identity tokens and attribute
conditions to enhance the realism of the image. To fully utilize the identity
tokens for generation face images and improve identity preservation, we use an
additional 45% probability to drop attribute tokens.

4.1 Experimental Setup
Datasets.Duringtraining,weleveragetheVoxCeleb1andVoxCeleb2[6]dataset.
During the evaluation, we leverage the 491 test videos from the VoxCeleb1 [21]
dataset and randomly sample 1,000 images in quantitative evaluation for face
reenactment. We use FaceForensics++ [25] in quantitative evaluation for face
swapping. We also spare 1,000 images from VoxCeleb2 for qualitative evalua-
tion.FollowingthepreprocessingmethodinFOMM[29],wecropfacesfromthe
original videos and resize them to 512×512 for training and evaluation.
Evaluation Metrics. For face reenactment, we use PSNR and LPIPS [47]
to evaluate the reconstruction quality for same-identity reenactment. We use
FID [13] to evaluate the overall quality of the generated images. We use co-
sine similarity (CSIM) calculated by [18] to evaluate identity preservation. The
motion transfer error is measured by Pose, Exp, and Gaze, which calculate the
average Euclidean distances of pose, expression, and gaze coefficients between
the generated and drive images. For face swapping, ID retrieval (ID) retrieves
the closest face to evaluate identity modification, while Pose, Exp, and Gaze
evaluate the attribute error between the generated faces and target faces.
Implementation Details. The Adapting Area Predictor is modified from the
parsingmodel[41],with6inputchannelsand1outputchannel.Theidentity-to-
tokensisimplementedwitha3-layertransformerdecoder,alinearlayerisadded
to project the identity feature dimensions to 768. The architecture of attribute-
to-tokens is the same as the identity-to-tokens, except the input dimensions of
the linear layer are consistent with the output dimensions of the CLIP model.
We adopt the StableDiffusion v1-5 [9] as the pre-trained diffusion model and
clip-vit-large-patch14 [10] from OpenAI as the CLIP vision model in this paper.
We train our face-adapter for 70,000 steps on 8×V100 NVIDIA GPUs with a
constant learning rate of 1e-4 and a batch size of 32.

Duringinference,addingthesourcebackgroundinspatialconditionsignificantly
reduces the difficulty of generating backgrounds, improving background consis-
tency. As a result, our method is capable of producing high-quality images with
clear advantages in FID scores as well as in reconstruction metrics, i.e., PSNR
and LPIPS. In terms of motion control, our method performs well in pose and
gaze error, but not as well in expression error. As our landmarks are derived
from D3DFR, both the reconstruction and projection processes, along with the
sparsity of the landmarks, result in a loss of expression accuracy. Therefore, our
methodachievesarelativelymoderateperformanceintermsofexpressionerror.
In Fig. 5 and Fig. 6, we compare with SoTA methods qualitatively on Vox-
Celeb1 and Voxceleb2 test set. The Spatial Condition Generator effectively en-
sures that our results are consistent with the source background and meanwhile
reduces the training difficulty of the model, allowing it to focus more on face
generation and improve the image quality. Freezing all parameters of the U-
Net avoids overfitting and preserves as much of the powerful prior from the
pre-trained diffusion model as possible. As a result, compared to other GAN-
based methods and diffusion-based methods trained from scratch like FADM,
ourmethodiscapableofgeneratingfaithfulattributedetails, i.e.,hairtexture,
hat, and accessories, that are consistent with the source image.
In addition to local details, the attribute tokens in the Attribute Controller
effectively extract global illumination from the source image, significantly out-
performingothermethods.Thisfurtherhighlightsthestrengthsandcapabilities
of our proposed approach in capturing both local and global features, leading
to more realistic and accurate results. Even when dealing with large poses, the
Identity Encoder ensures robust identity preservation, and the pre-trained dif-

trained for 35,000 steps. Quantitative evaluations are conducted on Voxceleb1

Adapting Area Predictor. As demonstrated in Tab. 3 and Fig. 9, without
the Adapting Area Predictor, the spatial control lacks the background and only
includeslandmarksfromthe3DLandmarkProjector.Duringtraining,themodel
extracts the background features from the source image in face reenactment,
while using the target image background as the ground truth. This discrepancy

maintain consistency with the background of the source image during inference.
As for face swapping, the model is not trained with inpainting task, which leads
to noticeable unnatural artifacts when blending the face with the surrounding
area during inference.14 Y. Han et al.

and image quality. The pre-trained CLIP is trained for discrimination tasks and
lacks detailed texture features needed for generation tasks. Fine-tuning CLIP
helps to extract detailed attribute features, including hair, clothing, part of the
missing backgrounds, and global lighting; in addition to this, the fine-tuned
CLIP model also extracts some features related to face identity, which benefits
the identity similarity score in face reenactment.

5 Conclusion
In this paper, we present a novel Face-Adapter framework, a plug-and-play fa-
cial editing adapter that supports fine control over identity and attributes for
pretrained diffusion models. Utilizing only one model, this adapter effectively
addressesfacereenactmentandswappingtasks,surpassingpreviousstate-of-the-
art GAN-based and diffusion-based methods. It comprises a Spatial Condition
Generator, an Identity Encoder, and an Attribute Controller. The Spatial Con-
dition Generator is used to predict the 3D prior landmarks and the mask of the
areathatneedstobechanged,workingwiththeIdentityEncoderandAttribute
Controller to formulate reenactment and swapping tasks as conditional inpaint-
ing with sufficient spatial guidance, identity, and essential attributes. Through
reasonableandhighlydecoupledconditiondesign,weunleashthegenerativeca-
pabilitiesofpretraineddiffusionmodelsforfacereenactmentandswappingtasks.
Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the superiority
of our method.
Limitations Our unified model is unable to achieve temporal stability in video
face reenactment/ swapping, which requires incorporating additional temporal
fine-tuning in the future.
PotentialSocialImpactForthefirsttime,weexplorealightweightframework
based on diffusion for simultaneous face reenactment and swapping, which has
higher practical value while improving the quality of generated content. How-
ever, the potential misuse of Face-Adapter can lead to privacy invasion, mis-
information spread, and ethical concerns. To mitigate these risks, both visible
and invisible digital watermarks can be incorporated to help identify the origin
and authenticity of the content. On the other side, Face-Adapter can contribute
to the field of forgery detection, further enhancing the ability to identify and
combat deepfakes.
