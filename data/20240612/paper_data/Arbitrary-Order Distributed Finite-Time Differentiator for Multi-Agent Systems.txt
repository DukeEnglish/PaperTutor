I. INTRODUCTION
Sensornetworklocalizationandformationcontrolaretwofundamentalresearchproblemsinnetworkedmulti-agentsystems,
which have many applications in civil and military areas [1]–[4]. For the distributed cooperative control of leader-follower
multi-agent system, a basic problem is that a large number of followers can’t get the leader’s information directly, so it is
difficultfor mostfollowersto trackthe leader directly.Therefore,a commonmethodis to firstdesign a distributedobserverso
thatallfolloweragentscanestimatetheleader’sinformation,andthenthedistributedcooperativecontrolproblemistransformed
into a centralized tracking control problem.
For distributed observer,there exist manyresearches.Based on the distributedobserver,the cooperativeoutputregulationof
LTI plantwas solvedin [6]. A robustcontrollerfor multipleEuler- Lagrangesystems was designedin [7] based ondistributed
reduced-order observer. Robust distributed observers were proposed in [8], [9] to handle the uncertainty and disturbance of
the system. For fuzzy multi-agentsystems, a distributed observerbased composite controllaw was proposedin [10]. Adaptive
distributedobserverswereproposedin[11]–[13].Somedistributedfinite-time/fixed-timeobserverswereproposedin[14]–[19].
However, most of these observers need the leader’s internal state information or control input information, so they are not
distributed differentiators. To the best of our knowledge, no related algorithm can achieve the same function, i.e., distributed
finite-time differentiator.
Inmanypracticalapplications,onlytheoutputoftheleadersystemisavailable,whichmakesitdifficulttoapplycooperative
controlofleader-followerMASthatrequireseitherthefullstatesorpartialinternalstatesoftheleader[20].Insomescenarios,
it is common that only the relative output information can be obtained, instead of the absolute global output information. For
each follower agent, the relative position and relative velocity between itself and the leader are more crucial than the absolute
global position and velocity in formation control. As an example, in groups of mobile robots, obtaining the global positions
of the robots is often challenging or even impossible. Instead, the relative position measurements between the robots should
be used to perform cooperative control and achieve the desired collective behavior [21]. Moreover, compared with position
measurements, velocity and acceleration measurements are generally more challenging to obtain in practice [22], [23]. More
importantly,onlyrelativepositionisavailableinsteadofglobalabsolutepositionintheGPS-deniedenvironment.Therefore,the
study of distributed observer based only on the relative output informationhas important theoretical significance and practical
value [26], [27].
The main contributions of this paper are as follows.
• Arbitrary-order distributed finite-time differentiator via relative output information (AODFD-R) is proposed. Each fol-
lower agent can obtain the relative output information between itself and leader and the relative output’s arbitrary-order
derivatives, where the information to be measured is only the relative output information between each agent and its
neighboring agents.

then Ψ(A) is said to be an undirected graph. For every different vertices v and v , there is a path from v to v , then Ψ

vector b=[b ,b ,...,b ]T Rm. If agent i can get the leader’s information, then b >0, otherwise, b =0. Besides, define

1) Theoretical Motivation: In the distributed cooperative control of leader-follower multi-agent systems, a key problem
lies in how the follower agent obtains the leader’s position and its own position. In the GPS available environment, on the
one hand, each follower agent can obtain its real-time global position through GPS. On the other hand, a small number of
followeragentscanobtainleader’sinformationthroughGPS orreal-timecommunicationwith leader,andtransmitthe leader’s
information to all follower agents through distributed observer. At this point, each follower agent obtains its own information
and leader’s information, and obtains relative information through difference, which will be use for the next tracking control.
However, one premise of the above method is that global position information can be obtained by GPS. In the GPS-denied3
environment, as shown in Fig. 1, the above method is not available, which leads to a question: can a distributed observer be
designed only by the local relative output information between agents so that each follower agent can estimate the relative
output between itself and the leader and the relative output’s arbitrary-order derivatives?
2) A Physical Example (Formation Control of Unmanned Vehicles) : In the GPS-denied environment, the relative
position with neighboring vehicle can be obtained instead of absolute position. For simplicity, we assume that the model of
the j-th follower vehicle is
x˙ (t)=v (t), v˙ (t)=u (t)+δ (t), (1)
j j j j j
wherex ,v ,u R,andδ Risj-thfollowervehicle’sposition,velocity,controlinputandlumpeddisturbance,respectively.

To effectively track the leader agent, the j-th follower agent requires access to important information including relative
position x x , relative velocity v v , and unknown part of relative acceleration δ δ . However, the information to be

measured is only the local relative position information in the GPS-denied environment.
Thisraisesaspecificquestion:howtoobtaintherelativeposition,relativevelocity,andunknownpartofrelativeacceleration
between each follower vehicle and the leader vehicle where the information to be measured is only the relative position
information between each follower vehicle and its neighboring vehicles?
3) Solutions to the above issues: We propose an arbitrary-order distributed finite-time differentiator via relative output
information(AODFD-R) suchthateach followeragentcanobtainthe relativeoutputinformationbetweenitself andleaderand
the relative output’s arbitrary-order derivatives, where the information to be measured is only the relative output information
between each agent and its neighboringagents. As a simple extension of AODFD-R, the arbitrary-orderdistributed finite-time
differentiator via absolute output information (AODFD-A) is also given.
C. Comparison of different algorithms for distributed cooperative control of leader-follower multi-agent systems
One kind of distributed cooperative control method is to design a distributed controller directly using local relative infor-
mation. However, the leader’s control input is unknown to the follower agents, which is equivalent to the disturbance in the
consensus error system [31]–[33]. Therefore, it is generally assumed that the leader’s control input is 0 or the disturbance is
suppressed by discontinuous control method, which may bring chattering problem.
Anotherkindofdistributedcooperativecontrolmethodistodesignadistributedobservertoestimatetheleader’sinformation
and then design a centralized tracking controller [5], [15]–[17], [28]–[30], [34]. By using the AODFD-R (AODFD-A), each
followeragentcanobtaintherelativeoutputbetweenitselfandtheleaderandtherelativeoutput’sarbitrary-orderderivatives(the
absolute outputof the leader and the absolute output’sarbitrary-orderderivatives) in a finite time. At this time, the distributed
cooperativecontrolproblem becomesa centralized tracking controlproblem,and many centralized tracking algorithmscan be
used, so omitted here.
The information required by different algorithms and the corresponding performance are shown in Table I, which shows
thatthe algorithmsproposedin thispapernotonlyneedthe least information,butalso has goodconvergenceperformanceand
strong anti-interference ability.

IV. Numerical examples and simulations
In the simulations, we take second-order DFD (i.e., n = 3) as an example. One typical communication topology is shown
in Fig. 2.
A. Arbitrary-order distributed finite-time differentiator via relative output information (AODFD-R)
In the simulation, we set f(t) = sin(t),δ (t) = 0.53cos(0.5t),δ (t) = 0.53sin(0.5t),δ (t) = 1.13sin(1.1t), δ (t) =

It can be seen from the figures that each follower agent can estimate the relative output between itself and the leader and the
relative output’s first and second derivatives in a finite time, which verifies the effectiveness of AODFD-R.6

can estimate the output of leader and the output’s first and second derivatives in a finite time, which verifies the effectiveness
of AODFD-A.
V. Conclusion
In this paper, arbitrary-orderdistributed finite-time differentiator (AODFD) has been proposed by using relative or absolute
outputinformation,and its finite-time stability has been provedby skillfully constructingLyapunovfunction.In the future,we
will apply the algorithm to formation control by only using relative output information.
