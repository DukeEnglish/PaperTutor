expertise in AI who are nonetheless affected by AI decisions. A particular challenge
with lay users is that basic assumptions around numeracy, literacy, and technological
competencecannotbetakenforgranted[9,10]. Thissuggeststhattheappropriateness
of certain kinds of user studies may be very different for lay users compared to other
stakeholders. Atthesametime, layusersmaybelessablethanotherstakeholdersto
protect themselves against the negative effects of AI [11], so developing appropriate
XAIforlayusersseemscrucialtothebroaderaimsofethicalAI.

conducted over seven weeks in early 2023. The study involved 18 participants from

a consumer-grade smart heating application, called Squid, that combined consumer

prices used by the models to make predictions (evasion attacks). Poisoning attacks

3.2 XAIFeatures
Amachinelearningmodelisaglass-boxmodel(orinherentlyinterpretablemodel)if
its internals can be inspected and ascribed meaning that is intuitive to humans (e.g.
decision trees, linear models). Conversely, a machine learning model is a black-box
model if its internals cannot be inspected or can be inspected but cannot be ascribed
5intuitivemeaning(e.g.neuralnetworks,ensemblemodels). XAIformachinelearning
is commonly divided between interpretability-by-design (i.e. use glass-box models)
andpost-hocmethods(i.e.explain/interpretanyalready-trainedmodel)[42,17]. Itis
commonlyacceptedthatthereisatrade-offbetweeninterpretabilityandperformance,
withblack-boxmodelsbeingmoreperformantthanglass-boxmodels[43]. Choosing
interpretability-by-designcanthusbeunderstoodassacrificingperformanceforthesake
ofinterpretability. However,thefactthatamodelmaybeinherentlyinterpretabledoes
not imply that it is inherently comprehensible, although these two concepts are often
conflatedintheliterature[44]. Aclassicexampleisadecisiontreewiththousandsof
nodes: itisaglass-boxmodelconsistingofatreewherenodeshaveintuitivemeaning
(e.g.if ùëã >ùëå thengotochild ùê¥elsegotochild ùêµ)andapathcanbeeasilytracedto

abilitytoinspectaglass-boxmodeldoesnotexplainwhythemodellooksasitdoes,so
interpretability-by-designinitselfdoesnotavoidotherchallengesfacingXAI.
As a linear model, Bayesian linear regression would typically be regarded as a
glass-boxmodel[17]. Squidcanthusbesaidtofollowtheapproachofinterpretability-
by-design, albeit as a consequence of SmartThermo having implicitly followed the
sameapproach. Squidreliesonasingleinputfeature(price)andasingletargetfeature
(setpoint),whichgivesrisetoonlytwomodelparameters(biasandslope). Thisplaces
Squidarguablyamongthesimplestinstancesofaparticularkindofglass-boxmodel.
Inturnthisposesaninterestingresearchquestion: canlayusersunderstandwhatmay
be regarded by AI experts as an especially simple glass-box model? If not, it seems
unlikelythatlayuserswouldfairmuchbetterwithamoreperformantblack-boxmodel,
irrespective of the choice of post-hoc method(s). As mentioned, interpretability-by-
design does not itself avoid other challenges facing XAI, and this is especially true
in the context of lay users. Two major challenges in Squid are: (i) that the model
expresses (probabilistic) uncertainty over learned user preferences and (ii) that the
modelevolvesovertimebasedonuserinputs, apredefinedpriordistributionùëö , and
1
aninputnoiseparameter ùõΩ. Howtocommunicatethisinformationtolayusers‚Äîina
waythatisaccurateyetrelevanttotheirneeds‚Äîisfarfromclear,giventhatitrelieson
mathematicalconceptsthatmaybeunfamiliartothem.
Popularpost-hocmethodsinXAIinclude: globalfeaturedependencymethods[45,
46],whichmeasuretherelationshipbetweeninputfeaturesandmodelpredictions;local
featureimportancemethods[47,48],whichmeasuretheimportanceofinputfeatureson
thepredictionforagivendatapoint;andcounterfactualexamplemethods[49,50],which
select alternative datapoints leading to some desired prediction. All three methods
would trivialise in Squid, e.g. feature-based methods would reduce to a single input
feature(price)whilecounterfactualexamplemethodswouldreducetoinspectingatwo-
dimensional line chart (price vs. setpoint) that is also linear. An obvious alternative
then is to expose the glass-box model to users with the aid of visualisations [51, 52],
especiallyinteractivevisualisations[42]. ThisistheapproachtakeninSquid,whichis
supportedbypreviousfindingsonthebenefitsofinteractivenessinXAI(seeSection2).

madeonaveragelessthatthreesetpointadjustmentsbeforeoptingtoresettheirlearned

models. ApossibleexplanationisthatthedesignofSmartThermofailedtocaptureany
temporalityinuserpreferences: eachuserhadasingleBayesianmodelthatwasactive
regardlessoftime-of-dayorday-of-week,andthemodelitselfdidnotconsideranydata
thatmightgivetemporalcontexttouserinputs. In[13]theauthorsacknowledgethat

Arguably this issue is analogous to the distinction between a traditional thermostat
and a programmable thermostat, where the former relies on a setpoint that is fixed
regardlessoftime-of-dayorday-of-week,andthelatterreliesonasetpointthatfollows
a programmable setpoint schedule, typically a rolling one-week schedule. Following
thisidea,areasonablegeneralisationofSmartThermothatisconsistentwiththedesign

temporalityinuserpreferences,includingthetemporalcontextofuserinputs,without
changing the underlying Bayesian method proposed by Shann et al. We expect that
this would improve user satisfaction in learned preferences over the design used by
SmartThermo, so this is the design we adopt in Squid. We will now outline the four
mainelementsoftheuserinterface,whichvariouslyreflectthisdesign.
SchedulePage
Theschedulepage(Figure4a)displaystheuser‚Äôscurrentweeklyschedule,comprised
ofanindependentscheduleforeachdayoftheweek. Theschedulefollowsthetypical
design used by programmable thermostats (e.g. EPH CP4) where each day is parti-
tioned into a set of timeslots aligned to 15-minute intervals (e.g. 06:45‚Äì08:30). In a
programmable thermostat each timeslot would be allocated a setpoint. In Squid each
timeslotisallocatedoneoffiveprofiles,eachhavingitsownBayesianmodelasdefined
inSection3.1. Thefiveprofilesarecolour-codedandgivenconcretemeaningviapre-

Finally, selecting an individual timeslot on the schedule page opens the timeslot

ProfilesPage
Theprofilespage(Figure5a)allowsuserstoinspectand/orresetanyofthefiveprofiles.
Thepageconsistsofthreeinsightsintothemodelofaselectedprofile: achartshowing

whichisalsothemodelusedtoinitialiseprofilesforallnewuseraccounts.
IntheBayesianmodel,pricesensitivityisan(unbounded)dimensionlessparameter,
whichmayprovedifficultforlayuserstocomprehend. Thegaugeisintendedtoaddress
this issue by interpreting the parameter on a six-point scale; it consists of four cyan-
colouredsegments,tworedsegments,andadialthatpointstooneofthosesegments
based on the price sensitivity of the selected profile. The two red segments appear
on either side of the cyan segments. The segments are determined by bucketing
price sensitivity values into categories based on a lower bound ùúá ùë†ùëñ = 0 and an upper
bound ùúá ùë†ùëñ = (cid:0)ùúá ùëèùëñ ‚àíùë¶ min(cid:1) /35 such that ùë¶ min is some low setpoint (ùë¶ min < ùúá ùëèùëñ). This

Originally the low setpoint was defined as the minimum setpoint supported by the
Netatmo hardware (7¬∞C) but this was found to cause the gauge to be insufficiently
discriminative under typical usage. During the study the low setpoint was instead
defined as 12.2¬∞C based on observed gauge behaviour under typical usage. The left
redsegmentindicatesthatthepricesensitivityisbelowthelowerbound(i.e.negative
pricesensitivity),andtherightredsegmentindicatesthatthepricesensitivityisabove
theupperbound(i.e.contextuallyhighpricesensitivity). Thefourcyansegmentsthen

13QuickAccessPanel
Thequickaccesspanel(Figure6)representstheprimaryelementoftheuserinterface.
On larger displays (e.g. desktops) the panel is always visible and appears to the right
oftheuserinterface. Onsmallerdisplays(e.g.mobile)thepanelappearsinanoverlay
accessedviaahamburgerbuttonatthetop-leftoftheinterface. Thepanelisdivided
intotwosections: Heating(top)andEnergy(bottom).
Theheatingsectionconsistsofthecurrenttemperatureindicator(top-left),setpoint
controller(top-right),valvestatusandactiveprofileindicators(bottom-left),andsystem
modecontroller(bottom-right). Thecurrenttemperatureandvalvestatus(open/closed)
areasreportedbytheNetatmohardware,whiletheactiveprofileistheprofileallocated
to the current timeslot by the user‚Äôs schedule. The setpoint controller is an input
slider that ranges from 7¬∞C to 30¬∞C in increments of 0.5¬∞C (i.e. setpoints supported
by the hardware). The current setpoint is indicated by the slider handle. Moving
this handle allows the user to adjust the setpoint. If the handle is moved, Yes and
Cancel buttons appear, prompting the user to confirm their choice. There are four
systemmodes: on,off,auto,andoverride. Thesystemmodecontrollerisathree-way
toggle that allows the user to switch between these modes. In on mode, setpoints
are temporarily disabled and the valve is set to remain open. Likewise, in off mode,
setpointsaretemporarilydisabledandthevalveissettoremainclosed. Inautomode,
the setpoint is automatically controlled by the system according to the active profile
andcurrentenergyprice. Conversely,inoverridemode,automaticsetpointcontrolis
temporarily disabled and the setpoint is instead based on the user‚Äôs input. Compared
to SmartThermo [13, 14], on mode is equivalent to its boost option, while override
modeisequivalenttoitsindirectlearningdesign. Ifeitheronoroffmodeisselected,
the mode is enabled for a period of one hour, after which the system returns to auto
mode. Ifthesetpointisadjusted, themodelisupdatedandoverridemodeisenabled

displayed below the system mode controller. These modes may be terminated at any
timebyselectingtheautooptiononthesystemmodecontroller. Overridemodemay
also be terminated by selecting a Cancel button that appears beside the system mode
controllerwhileinoverridemode.
Finally, theenergysectionconsistsofthecurrentenergypriceindicator(top)and
the price summary indicator (bottom). The current energy price indicator simply
displays the price for the current 30-minute slot. The price summary indicator then

Thenotificationspage(Figure7)providesalogofeventnotificationsallowingusers
to inspect the complete history of events associated with their user account. The
notificationsaredisplayedinapaginatedtablewithfourcolumns: date,time,category,

thecategorycolumn,eventsarepartitionedintotwotypes: userandsystem. Theuser
category includes four event types: user setpoint adjustments, system mode changes,
profile resets, and schedule updates. The system category includes two event types:
auto setpoint adjustments (e.g. due to price changes) and profile updates. Each event
type has a notification template used to generate a text-based message shown in the

4.1 UserComprehension
TheSmartThermostudywasnotfocusedonXAI,andlargelypredatesthere-emergence
ofXAIseeninrecentyears. Theauthorsnonethelessanalysedusercomprehensionof
itsAIfeature,whichtheyframedintermsofusermentalmodelsasdemonstratedduring
exit interviews [13]. Results from that analysis offer an interesting companion to our
ownstudy. Evenbytheendofthatstudy,someSmartThermousersweredemonstrating
little curiosity in its AI feature: ‚Äúwhen we asked the users‚Äô opinion about what the
thermostat was learning in the interviews, three users [out of 20] reported that they
hadnotthoughtaboutitbefore.‚Äù Fortheremainingusers,theauthorssaidthat‚Äúmost
participantsappearedtohaveanunderstandingthat[was]well-matchedwiththeactual
underpinningsofthethermostat‚Äôslearningfeature‚Äù,e.g.oneuserdescribeditasfollows:
As you input your set point changes according to the prices and then the
systemstartstounderstandwhatyourviewsareofthatcostIsuppose. That
iswhatyouthinkisexpensiveandthatiswhatyouthinkischeap,andthen
makechanges.
Cruciallytheauthorsalsosaidthatseveralusersdemonstatedanincorrectmentalmodel
oftheAIfeature,withtheirunderstandingbeingthatitlearnedusersetpointpreferences
asafunctionoftime(withoutreferencetoprice),e.g.accordingtooneuser:
If I play a particular temperature as the setpoint and then click on save
and learn, from what I understand is the system will take this reading to
considerationforwhethertoturntheboileronoroffbutatthesametime
try to see that at this particular time of the day, whether it‚Äôs weekday or
weekendandthentrytoreplicatethatduringotherdays.
Theauthorsdidnotreportexactlyhowmanyusersdemonstratedthisincorrectmental
modelbutsaidthatit‚Äúwasmoreprevalentamongtheindirectlearningthermostatusers
thanamongtheusersofthedirectlearningthermostat‚Äù. Thissuggeststhatthenumber
20ofuserswiththisincorrectmentalmodelwasnon-neglible. Moreover,thefactthatit
was more prevalent among indirect learning users makes it of particular relevance to
our study, given that the indirect learning design was the design replicated in Squid.
According to the authors, no user reported familiarity with existing consumer smart
thermstats,includingthosethatdoseektolearnusersetpointpreferencesasafunction
of time (e.g. Nest Learning Thermostat), so they discounted the possibility that users
mayhavebeenbiasedbypriorexperience.
Reflectingonourinterviews,wefoundnoevidencethatanyparticipantdeveloped
anincorrectmentalmodeloftheAIfeatureinSquid,includingonesimilartothatseenin
theSmartThermostudy. Ofcourse,SquidandSmartThermowerenotpartofthesame
study so we cannot draw concrete conclusions about why our results were different.
Nonetheless,ourresultsareconsistentwithahypothesisthatdesignchangesinSquid
wouldhaveapositiveeffectonusercomprehensioncomparedtoSmartThermo. These
designchangesinclude(butarenotlimitedto)theadditionofmultipleBayesianmodels
as outlined in Section 3.4 and the addition of some XAI-related features as outlined
earlierinSection4. WhileweintroducedtemporalityintotheAIfeatureviamultiple
models, thereis noevidence that anyparticipant believedthat the modelsthemselves
learned user setpoint preferences as a function of time. For example, Ernesto and
Theo both gave accurate explanations regarding the model itself, and although Theo
expressed some confusion regarding the impact of having multiple models, Simone
gaveaccurateexplanationsofboth:
Ernesto: TheAIwilltrytoadjust,toreducethetemperature,butnotalot,

At the conclusion of Phase 1, during Interview 2, participants were asked to rank six

Quickaccesspanel
As mentioned, the quick access panel was reported as the most-used feature during
Phase1,whilesetpointadjustments(madeviathequickaccesspanel)werefoundtobe

Timeslotoverlay
Ender and Ac¬∏elya both described the timeslot overlay as ‚Äúunderstandable‚Äù. Sam was

Maya: I think it is very clear what it says, this the price, this is the
temperature and when the price is really high the AI tends to lower the
temperaturealittlebitbutinaccordancewithyourdesiredtemperature,so
itgoesbackup.
In terms of usage, Debora said that she relied on the timeslot overlay to inspect her

Againitseemsthatthechosenterminologymayhavebeenafactorinthisconfusion.
The gauge divided opinion and was generally not well-understood. For example,
whileDeborasaidthegaugewas‚Äúveryinteresting‚Äù,SamandMarabothsaiditwasnot
understandable. Theconceptofpricesensitivityasakindofmeasurablecharactertrait
seemedtoengageusers,butinsomecasesthelearnedvalueconflictedwiththeuser‚Äôs

Thedesignofthegaugewasintendedtodescribethecurrentpricesensitivityvaluein
terms of a typical range, with the teal segments indicating typical values and the red

Barƒ±s¬∏: Ifwegotoleft,red,thatmeanswe‚Äôrekeepingcold.
Aris: Ifitgoestothered,youarespendingeverything.
As mentioned in Section 3.4, the gauge was also designed to avoid implying to users
that a particular price sentivity value in the typical range was objectively desirable.
While this design choice was largely successful in its aim, the lack of an objectively
desirablepricesensitivityvaluewasasourceoffrustrationforIsaad:
Isaad: It‚Äôs just trying to stay in the middle. It doesn‚Äôt tell me anything.
That only has a meaning if there‚Äôs a target, if there‚Äôs a limit, if there‚Äôs
somethingyou‚Äôreaimingfor. Thisisjust,yes,indicative,butindicativeof
whatIdon‚Äôtknow,and,again,itdoesn‚Äôtdrivemetodoanything.
ThiscommentechoestheearliercommentfromIsaadthatthechartontheprofilespage
did not provide actionable information. However, these two comments were outliers;
mostusersseemedsatisfiedthattheprofilespagedescribedwhatthesystemhadlearned
about their preferences, and that this information was implicitly actionable, i.e. if the
user was unsatisified with the current learned preferences, they could intervene by
providingmoreinputsand/orbyresettingtheprofile. Makingthisactionabilitymore
explicitontheprofilespagemayhavemitigatedtheissuesraisedbyIsaad.
Theprofilespagealloweduserstoinspect(andthuscompare)anyprofilebyselecting

Most users framed the notifications page as a traditional log file. Sam described the
entriesasarepresentationofhis‚Äúhistory‚Äù. Debora,Aris,andCarriealldescribedthe

27XAIoverlay
Among the four charts on the XAI overlay, the fourth chart was frequently cited as
themostusefulandintuitive. CarrieandRiabothdescribedthefourthchartas‚Äúeasy
to understand‚Äù, while Ender said it was ‚Äúunderstandable‚Äù. Theo said the fourth chart
‚Äúmakesthemostsense‚Äù,whichwasasentimentechoedbySimone:

As noted already, the XAI overlay was generally not used much during Phase 1.
Some users complained that the XAI overlay required too much effort to understand,

31Ender: Generally people just want the results, so if I am using some AI

Mara and Sam both felt that an embedded video tutorial would offer users an easier

userswhendiscussingPhase2, likelyduetoitsprominenceintheinterfaceandtheir
preoccupation with AI attacks; when prompted, however, users tended to report that
it was still frequently used. The schedule page was also largely overlooked by users;

DiagnosticStrategies
AsoutlinedinSection3.5,therewerevariousdirectandindirectindicatorsofAIattacks
within the web interface, including the quick access panel, timeslot overlay, profiles
33page,XAIoverlay,andnotificationspage. TheoandNaadirbothusedthequickaccess

Theo described the notifications page as ‚Äústraightforward‚Äù, while Simone said it was
useful because it allowed her to ‚Äúsee back in time‚Äù. Kevin felt that inspecting the

Kevin: Becausethisone,thisnotification,Icancheckthetargettempera-

UnreliableStategies
There is strong evidence that some users adopted unreliable strategies for diagnosing
AI attacks by rigidly interpreting atypical system behaviour as attack indicators. For
example, Simone and Ernesto both appear to have adopted unreliable strategies for
interpretingthechartontheprofilespage,e.g.whereattackswouldonlybeindicated
byazeroornegativepricesensitivity:
Simone: Thetoptwo,poisoning,atleastIknew,kindofforsure,because
the[line]wouldbegoinguporstraight,itwouldn‚Äôtgodown.
Ernesto: Yes, that when slope is so obvious, it means they have altered
the data, or things, because you expect it to be more steady, very low
slope. Whenyouseeamuchhigherone, itisquiteclear, anywayweare
not‚Äîbecausethatone,wasnotliketheinitialoneswherekindofwerean

Maya: But the thing is we could, if we mess with our temperature too
often, also mislead that gauge thing so I would never be sure if it‚Äôs off

Only Ender reported to have seen the unknown setting of the gauge (see Section 3.4)
and,similartoKlara‚Äôsinterpretationoftheredsegments,concludedthatthisindicated
anattackbecauseitwas‚Äúnotnormal‚Äù.
Detections&Misdetections
Ernesto first detected an A-1 attack while inspecting the profiles page, subsequently
confirminghissuspicionbycheckingthenotificationspage:
Ernesto: Then I noticed that as soon as I did that one of the profiles
changed. Then, I went to the notifications and then the user said, ‚ÄúYou
havedonethis.‚Äù I‚Äômlike,‚ÄúAh,Ihaven‚Äôtdonethat.‚Äù Ijustkindofcatchit
onthespot,Ibelieve.
Carrie detected an A-1 attack by identifying anomalous user-category events on the
notificationspage:
Carrie: I was actually looking for where the temperature had been set
because, a couple of times, it set it to seven degrees and that was really
obviouslywhatwasgoingon.
Comments from Naadir suggest that he was unaware of the possibility of indirect
indicatorsofattacks,focusinginsteadonenvironmentalindicatorsforA-2attacks:
Naadir: Not only that, I think realising one of the attacks was one that
didn‚Äôt record in the notifications. That, sort of, maybe changed my look
atitinaway. Itwasmorereallylisteningtothatasopposedtochecking
them,thenotesandthenotification.
DeboradetectedanA-2attackbyobservinganomalousbehaviouronthegauge:

ExplaininghowtheysuccessfullydetectedA-3attacks,SimoneandMayabothfeltthat
it was due to their understanding of the AI model itself, which was supported by the
chartontheprofilespage:
Simone: Whereasthethirdone,itwaslogical. Ifyoulookedatthegauge
andyoulookedatthe[line],itwasgoingtherightdirection. Becausethe
price was so high, it was being set very low. So this kind of made me
doubt, ‚ÄúIs this right?‚Äù Then I thought, ‚ÄúAh, this is another way to do an
attack,they‚Äôregoingtochangetheprice. That‚ÄôswhatIthought.
Maya: So I checked the overall temperature/price ratio and I thought,
‚ÄúMaybeit‚Äôsthinkingthepriceisreallyhighsoithadtomakeitlike7¬∞.‚Äù
SoIwasthinkingit‚ÄôsthelogicoftheAI,basically.

Ernesto: Knowing that they‚Äôre fake, you really bring something in your

In [14] the authors conducted a linear regression analysis of user setpoint adjust-

statistically significant results (ùëù < 0.05) that were said to confirm a hypothesis that

The Squid web interface was originally developed for desktops and tablets, with the
expectationthatparticipantswouldaccessitusingpersonaldevices. Havingasuitable

It was decided early in development that smartphones would not be supported due to
theirlimitedscreenrealestate. Throughoutdevelopmentthewebinterfacewastested
on various devices, including a desktop monitor (Dell U2719D), a laptop (MacBook
Pro),andastandard-sizedtablet(iPadAir). However,adecisionwasmaderatherlate
in development to provide each household with the same tablet (Galaxy Tab). This
wasintendedtoensureauniformexperienceforallusers. Unfortunatelyseveralusers
reportedusabilityandaccessibilityissuesinrelationtothetablet:
Debora: Andactually,sometimesitcanbealittlebitdifficultonthetablet

Theselectedtabletprovedtooffersignificantlylessscreenrealestatethanhadbeen

Forexample,theiPadAirhasover1.5timesthevirtualscreenrealestatecomparedto
the Galaxy Tab, and almost double the physical real estate. Compared to any device
that had been tested previously, the Galaxy Tab was able to display less information
on-screenatanyonetime. ComparedtotheiPadAir,thesameinformationon-screen
would also appear smaller. Aspect ratios of 1.68:1 for the GalaxyTab and 1.33:1 for
the iPad Air meant that vertical real estate on the Galaxy Tab was much narrower in
landscapemodethanontheiPadAir. Atthesametime,theGalaxyTabofferedmore
screen real estate than a standard smartphone, so it was still technically within the

AIattacks
The AI attacks simulated during the study were based on an existing taxonomy of
attacksonmachinelearning[19]. Inallcasesthesimulatedattacksweredesignedto
impactusersviathesetpointlearningfeature,specificallytocausethesystemtoadopt
a setpoint lower than it would otherwise have adopted. Interviews suggest that users
largelydidnotfindtheseattacksplausibleduetotheperceivedeffortrequiredfromthe
attackerversusthepotentialrewardsavailabletotheattacker:
Carrie: I find it quite hard to imagine why people would be attacking
individuals apart from, somehow, to get into the banking systems but
it seems like a very complex thing to have to do for a relatively small
financialgain.
Sam: Yesitis,becausethereisonlyamaximumyoucouldevergoonone

havetowakeupinthemiddleofthenight. Whereasabreachofdatafor
anycomputer,andwhenIsaycomputerImeananydevice,Alexa,mobile
or whatever. That is a bit more sensitive, because we are talking about
security.
Participants generally framed the AI attacks on Squid in terms of harrassment of the
user, butfeltthatthemostplausibleattackswouldbethoseofferingtheattackerwith
aclearsourceoffinancialgain. Whenparticipantswerepromptedwiththepossibility
thattheAIattacksonSquidcouldformpartofalarge-scaleattackontheenergygrid,
they generally felt that this was more plausible due to the significance of its impact.
However, in this instance participants generally felt that the software owner and/or
energyprovidershouldbeartheresponsibilityofdefendingagainsttheattacks, rather
45than end-users. Interviews provide no particular evidence that the plausibility of AI
attacks impacted user engagement during the study. Nonetheless, the responses raise
interestingquestionsforfutureworkintermsofwhenandhowbesttoprotectlayusers
