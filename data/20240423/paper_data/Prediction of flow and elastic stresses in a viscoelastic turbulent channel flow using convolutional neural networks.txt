1. Introduction
Viscoelasticfluidsarewidelyusedinindustrialprocesses,andanunderstandingofcomplex-
fluidbehaviourbecomescrucialforenterprisesworkingwithnon-Newtonianflows.Further,
in real-world scenarios, turbulent flows predominate, exhibiting chaotic and multi-scale
dynamics. The turbulent flows of purely viscoelastic fluids have important technological
implications due to increased mixing efficiencies at low Reynolds numbers and have also
piquedtheinterestindrag-reductionandflowcontrolcommunitiesathighReynoldsnumbers.

sequenceofactiveandhibernatingphases.Thesephasesaredistinguishedbyflowstructures
exhibiting strong vortices and wavy streaks during the active phase, and weak streamwise
vortices during the hibernation phase, with viscoelastic flows characterized by increased
hibernation intervals. Additional insights into the influence of polymer additives on drag
reductionaredetailedinXi(2019).
Identifying such effects of elasticity sparked an interest to detect and understand drag-
reducingbehaviourinthepresenceofbothelasticityandplasticityinthefluid.LeClainche
et al. (2020) analysed the simulation data of Rosti et al. (2018) using high-order dynamic
modedecomposition,andcomparedthemodesincomplexfluids(non-Newtonianfluids)with
thoseinNewtonianfluids.Theirresultsindicatedthatelasticityandplasticityofthecomplex
fluidshavesimilareffectsonthecoherentstructures;inbothcases,theflowisdominatedby
long streaks disrupted by rapid, localised perturbations. On the other hand, the Newtonian
flow displays short streaks and more chaotic dynamics. Izbassarov et al. (2021) found that
the largest amount of drag reduction is achieved with a combination of finite elasticity and
plasticity,andwhilethehighlyplasticflow(highBinghamnumbers)relaminarizes,elasticity
affectstherelaminarizationinacomplexandnon-monotonicfashion.
However, when it comes to canonical (and practical) flows of interest, direct numerical
simulations (DNSs) of viscoelastic (and/or elasto-viscoplastic) flow face challenges due to
substantial computational costs associated with capturing the diverse physical mechanisms
driving the flow. On the other hand, experimental investigations of drag reduction in
viscoelastic flows encounter limitations stemming from near-wall measurements and the
capabilities of experimental techniques to accurately quantify the flow, without perturbing
it.Whileacompletedescriptionofviscoelasticturbulencewouldrequirecharacterizationof

excellent capabilities in predicting the instantaneous state of the Newtonian turbulent flow
using quantities measured at the wall (Guastoni et al. 2021). Hence in the present study,
the idea of non-intrusive sensing has been applied to viscoelastic turbulent channel flow
to predict the velocity fluctuations and polymeric stress components near the wall using
the quantities measured at the wall. To this end, the convolutional-neural-network (CNN)
models are employed to predict the two-dimensional velocity fluctuations and polymeric-
stress fluctuation fields at different wall-normal distances. The present work highlights the

2. Methodology
2.1. Dataset
The dataset for training and evaluation of the network model is obtained through a direct
numerical simulation of turbulent channel flow of viscoelastic fluid at a Reynolds number
basedonthebulkvelocityofRe=𝑈 𝑏ℎ/𝜈 =2800(wherethebulkvelocity𝑈 𝑏correspondsto

beingthedensityand3
total viscosity of the fluid, respectively), which corresponds to a friction Reynolds number
Re𝜏 = 180 (where Re𝜏 is defined in terms of ℎ and friction velocity 𝑢 𝜏) for a Newtonian
fluid. In this study, the turbulent channel flow simulations are performed at a Weissenberg
number Wi = 8, (where Wi = 𝜆𝑈 𝑏/ℎ, with 𝜆 corresponding to the relaxation time of the
polymeric stresses and Wi quantifies the elastic forces with respect to the viscous forces,
thereby quantifying the degree of anisotropy in the flow). The ratio of polymeric viscosity
(cid:0)𝜇 𝑝(cid:1) to the total viscosity (𝜇 0), which is denoted by 𝛼, is set to 0.1, indicating that we

maximumpolymerextensibility 𝐿 = 60.Thedifficultiesassociatedwithproperrheological
characterization of real fluids by adequate constitutive equations is an important area of
research on its own and rather, we assume that the adopted model adequately describes
the intended fluid properties. Furthermore, to circumvent the high Weissenberg number
problem, log-conformation approach (Fattal & Kupferman 2004) is utilized to ensure the
postivie-definiteness of the conformation tensor. Here, the conformation tensor provides a
macroscopicviewofthepolymerdeformation.

The viscoelastic turbulent channel flow is simulated using a finite-difference-based in-
house code on a computational domain of size 6ℎ×2ℎ×3ℎ in the streamwise (𝑥), wall-
normal (𝑦) and spanwise directions (𝑧), respectively as shown in figure 1. The readers
are referred to Izbassarov et al. (2021) for a complete description of the viscoelastic
turbulentchannelsimulationemployedinthisstudy.Thecomputationaldomainisuniformly
discretized using 1728×576×864 grid points along 𝑥,𝑦 and 𝑧, respectively. The spatial
resolution of Δ𝑥+ = Δ𝑦+ = Δ𝑧+ < 0.6 is chosen to fully resolve the turbulent scales in
the viscoelastic turbulent flow (Rosti et al. 2018). Here, the superscript ‘+’ denotes the
scaling in terms of friction velocity 𝑢

shear stress) as the velocity scale and viscous length ℓ∗(= 𝜈/𝑢 𝜏) as the length scale.
Note that the value of 𝑢 𝜏 obtained with Wi = 8 is lower than that in the Newtonian
case (cid:0)𝑢

the Newtonian case (Wi = 0) in figure 2. Here, 𝑈 𝑦 corresponds to the wall-normal
derivative of the streamwise velocity and ⟨·⟩ denotes the spatial averaging in 𝑥 and

𝑧 directions in the channel. The Reynolds decomposition of an instantaneous field 𝑈 is
denoted as ⟨𝑈⟩ +𝑢, with 𝑢 identifying the fluctuations. From figure 2, identifying the

To this end, a database consisting of instantaneous fluctuation fields of wall-shear-stress
components,wall-pressurefluctuation,two-dimensionalvelocity-fluctuationandpolymeric-
stress-fluctuation fields are obtained at different wall-normal locations, 𝑦+ ≈ 13.6,26.7
and 44.2 (𝑦/ℎ ≈ 0.09,0.17 and 0.28, respectively). Note that these wall-normal locations
correspond respectively to 𝑦+ = 15,30 and 50 for a Newtonian turbulent channel flow and
hence, for simplicity we refer to these locations as 𝑦+ ≈ 15,30 and 50, respectively in this
study. The simulations are run for ∼ 120ℎ/𝑢 𝜏 time-units and a total of 40,600 samples is
obtained with a sampling period of Δ𝑡+ ≈ 1 for training the network model. The sampled
𝑠
instantaneous two-dimensional fields are down-sampled to a resolution of 432×432 in 𝑥
and 𝑧, respectively. The fields at both the walls are utilized in this study, and they are split

the samples in the test dataset which consists of 10,000 samples. The samples in the test

2.2. Neural-networkmodel
In this work, a fully convolutional neural network (FCN) similar to the one proposed
by Guastoni et al. (2021) is used, with increased hidden layers (see figure 1) to obtain a
more complex combination of abstract turbulent features identified by the kernels in the
network.Here,weutilizeanexistingarchitecture,acknowledgingthatfurtherenhancements
could be achieved with newer architectures that require extensive datasets. Our focus is
on proposing a methodology for viscoelastic stress predictions in turbulent flows aimed
towards experimental applications and in establishing baseline performance using current
convolutional architectures. The considered FCN consists of 30 hidden layers with a total
number of trainable parameters amounting to 985,105. The convolution operations are

The inputs to the network are normalized using respective mean and standard deviation of

In this study, three types of predictions have been undertaken to highlight the capability

FCN and random sampling of mini-batches during the training process. The instantaneous

3. Results
3.1. V-predictions
A qualitative prediction field for V-predictions is shown in figure 3 (corresponding to an
instant in the test dataset where the input wall-shear rate is higher than the mean wall-
shear rate). We observe the predicted velocity fields to be visually well correlated with
the DNS fields at different target wall-normal locations. The linear correlation coefficient
between the predicted and true streamwise-velocity fluctuation field exceeded 99% for
predictions at 𝑦+ ≈ 15, and gradually declining but remaining above 80% at 𝑦+ ≈ 50.

Due to the absence of polymeric-stress information in the inputs to the network model for

When assessing the accuracy of the instantaneous predictions based on mean-absolute
errors,asillustratedinfigure4,itbecomesapparentthattheMAE(ineachtestsample)varies
with wall-shear rate for different target wall-normal locations. Specifically, in instances of
low-wall-shear-rate,theabsoluteerrorsarenotablylower,andincreasewithwall-shearrate.
Thisisduetothefactthatlow-drageventstypicallyexhibitreducedfluctuationintensityand
itincreaseswithwall-shearrate,leadingtoincreasedconcentrationofenergyinsmall-scale
features. Consequently, the network encounters relative difficulty in accurately predicting
thesesmall-scalefeatures,resultinginhigherpredictionerrorsatlargewall-shear-rateinputs.
ItisworthnotingthatthevariationofMAE(ineachtestsample)withwall-shearratestems
from the selection of the loss function utilized in the network. Nevertheless, the obtained
network model exhibits superior predictive performance in capturing velocity-fluctuation
fields during low-wall-shear rate events. This observation underscores the potential utility
of such models in obtaining sufficiently accurate velocity fluctuations in an experimental
setting,moreparticularlyforstudyinghibernationeventsindetail.

Note that in V-E-predictions the polymeric stresses are predicted directly from the wall
inputs, without having access to the true velocity fields at the wall-normal location where
those stresses are predicted. Instead, predicted auxiliary velocity fields at that location
(together with wall inputs) are used to predict the polymeric stress fields. The obtained
errors of around 40% indicate that a small error in predicting velocity-fluctuation fields
significantly impacts the errors in predicting the polymeric-stress fields, indicating that
the auxiliary velocity fluctuation fields in V-E-predictions lack certain information that is
connected to the polymeric activity in the small wavelengths. Nevertheless, the large-scale

Examining the accuracy of instantaneous predictions based on mean-absolute errors, as
depicted in figure 6 for E-predictions and V-E-predictions, reveals a similar trend in MAE
(in each test sample) with respect to wall-shear rate as observed in V-predictions. Overall,
the absolute errors increase with wall-shear rate. Further, the magnitude of such absolute
errors in the field is nearly doubled for V-E-predictions (figure 6𝑏, 𝑑) compared to E-
predictions (figure 6𝑎, 𝑐). Moreover, the MAE in predicting polymer-stress quantities of

TheRMSofthetraceofthepolymerstressdecreasesaswemoveawayfromthewallfor

as the wall-normal distance increases. One plausible explanation for this phenomenon lies
in the increased presence of energetic large-scale structures in the diagonal components
of polymer stress tensor with respect to the wall-normal distance (see figure 8𝑏). Further,
the trace of the polymer stress exhibits an increasing anti-correlation with the streamwise

4. Conclusions
Thepresentworkhighlightsthecapabilityofadata-drivenapproachtoperformnon-intrusive
sensing in viscoelastic turbulent flows. Here we demonstrate the ability of CNN-based
modelstoaccuratelyreconstructthevelocityfluctuationsinviscoelasticturbulenceclosethe
wall,utilizingthetwowall-shearfluctuationcomponentsandthewall-pressurefluctuations
as inputs. Additionally, the network models successfully reproduce the polymeric-stress
fluctuation fields from the DNS velocity-fluctuation fields. Moreover, the feasibility of
these network models to extract polymer stress fluctuation fields of interest solely from
wallinputfluctuationsandpredictedvelocity-fluctuationsisexplored.Overall,thenetwork
