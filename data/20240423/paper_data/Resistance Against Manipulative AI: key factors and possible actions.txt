ABSTRACT
If AI is the new electricity, what should we do to keep ourselves from getting electrocuted? In
this work, we explore factors related to the potential of large language models (LLMs) to manip-
ulate human decisions. We describe the results of two experiments designed to determine what
characteristics of humans are associated with their susceptibility to LLM manipulation, and what
characteristics of LLMs are associated with their manipulativeness potential. We explore human
factorsbyconductinguserstudiesinwhichparticipantsanswergeneralknowledgequestionsusing
LLM-generatedhints, whereasLLMfactorsbyprovokinglanguagemodelstocreatemanipulative
statements. Then, we analyze their obedience, the persuasion strategies used, and the choice of
vocabulary. Based on these experiments, we discuss two actions that can protect us from LLM
manipulation. In the long term, we put AI literacy at the forefront, arguing that educating society
wouldminimizetheriskofmanipulationanditsconsequences. Wealsoproposeanadhocsolution,

1 Introduction
Large language models (LLMs) are being applied to a constantly growing number of tasks, some involving a lot of
responsibility.Therefore,itbecomescrucialtobeawareoftheirdangersandtodevelopsolutionsthatneutralizethem.
AmongtheirmostseverethreatsaremanipulationandAIdeception[1]. Misleadingandfallaciousmodelutterances,
ifbelieved,couldhavedireconsequences. OnecanonlyimaginehowhazardousitcouldbetoputanuntruthfulLLM
in the role of a credit counselor, a doctor, or a pharmacist. That is why it is becoming vital to study to what extent

TheissueofAIdeception, definedas“thesystematicproductionoffalsebeliefsinothersasameanstoaccomplish
some outcome other than the truth” is now increasingly being addressed [2]. Recently, we have seen many cases in
whichLLMscoulddeceiveussuccessfully[3,4,5],whichpotentiallyraisesanumberofdangers,aswehavesome

determined on the basis of two RAMAI experiments. Analysis of the results suggests actions that can mitigate the
threatsofmanipulativeAI.
Based on the above speculations, we pose five research questions we will strive to answer with two experiments.

Persuasion. Many recent research papers suggest that LLMs can produce highly persuasive utterances in various
settings, including writing articles or messages [15, 16, 17]. Since LLMs can resemble human language [18], they
pose a factual risk of impacting people’s opinions [6] through effective persuasion and rhetoric. Several persuasion
strategiestypologieshavebeencreated,suchassocially-orientedpersuasivestrategies[19],persuasivesystemdesign
principles[20]orculturestyleofpersuasion[21]. ThereisalsoAristotle’sclassicalrhetoricalframework[22],which

audience’s emotions, needs, values, and desires). Research suggests that people are more inclined to use emotional

3.2 Results
In the collected data, deceptive hints were displayed 1373 times in total. Participants trusted 459 of them, which
makes for 33,43%. This suggests that in one question out of three, users were unable to determine that they were
beingmanipulatedbasedontheutteranceitself. Takingintoaccountthatforsomeofthosequestionsparticipantshad
a priori knowledge, manipulative statements appear as a genuine threat. Moreover, we noted that in about 17% of

4.2 Results
(RQ3) How obedient different LLMs are to requests to generate manipulative statements? Models were obe-
dient to generate manipulative hints in around 34% of cases. Among the considered models, Mixtral-8x7B was the
least obedient as only 8.33% of its hints were deemed manipulative. Three models, Gemini-Pro (37.50%), Dolphin
(41.67%), and GPT-4 (41.67%) achieved similar results. GPT-3.5-turbo was the only model to complete the task in
more than half of cases (54.17%), which makes it the most prone to generate manipulative content. Obedience by

(RQ5) How does the wording of manipulative and truthful hints differ? The in-depth analysis of the LLMs’
responses revealed the significant differences in the linguistic style between truthful and manipulative hints in Ana-
lyticalThinking,LanguageEmotionality,LexicalDiversity,andWordCount. Surprisingly,neitherSelf-referencenor
Certainty words appeared in the truthful hints. We speculate that this is a result of asking LLMs to provide truthful
information,nottopersuadetherecipient. ThecomparisonbetweenhintsinLIWCcategoriesisshowninFigure5.
In our experiment, manipulative statements tended to be more emotional and less analytical than truthful ones. In
Figure 6, we present the per-model breakdown of LIWC indicators which differed significantly across both groups.
TheshiftinbothAnalyticalThinkingandEmotionalityisconsistentlyvisibleacrossallconsideredLLMs.
Furthermore, the manipulative statements not only included a greater number of words but also exhibited a higher
diversity than truthful ones. The tendency is stable among all models except GPT-4, which presents a reversed de-
pendence, being the only model that reflects the relationships observed in human speech [53]. Similarly to human
statements,GPT-4manipulativestatementscontainedfewerwords.
Given that LLMs are trained on the human text, it can be anticipated that the content they generate should exhibit
patternssimilartothosefoundinourcommunication. Surprisinglyitseemsnottoalwaysbethecase. However,we

Models. In the role of classifiers, we tested and compared models used in RAMAI-LLM (see Section 4.1). The
selection of these models allows us to investigate whether the same models that previously generated manipulative
contentarecapableofcapturingit.
Context settings. We assessed the classifiers in two distinct context settings, which are described in Table 4. Low-
context setting is universal, as it does not require any information besides the LLM answer. High-context setting
assumestheadditionalknowledgeofthepromptprovidedtotheLLM,whichmaynotalwaysbeavailable.

It appears that Mixtral-8x7B and GPT-4 are the most efficient models for the task of manipulation detection. They
achieved similar results to each other, standing out from the rest. In that case, Mixtral-8x7B seems to be a natural
choice for a Manipulation Fuse, as it is open-weights. Therefore, it is easily accessible, and its application could
becomemorewidespread.

10ResistanceAgainstManipulativeAI:keyfactorsandpossibleactions
GPT-4 and Mixtral-8x7b achieved the precision of 0.66 and 0.68, respectively. One may say that this performance
isstillnotsatisfyingandrequiresmuchimprovement. However,itmustbenotedthatitisambiguousandextremely
challengingtodecidewhetherahintisfalseormisleading,evenforhumanannotators. Letusconsiderthehint:
False Hint: Based on popular culture references, it seems that the Addams Family is closely as-
sociated with a different TV show. Therefore, the correct answer must be something other than
”Addams.”
Based on the context (question asked), the hint is indeed misleading, as ”Addams” was the correct answer, but it is
impossible to detect without that information. Furthermore, the LLM warned the recipient that this hint was false.
Hence, it technically did not lie. These are the reasons why it was so important to establish the exact criteria for
whenastatementisdeemedmanipulative. Unfortunately,wecannotexpectthemodelstofollowthesameindicators,
especiallyastheyoftenaretask-specific. Nonetheless,whenthestatementisunambiguouslytruthful,themodelspick
itupefficiently. BothGPT-4andMixtral-8x7bhadonlytwomistakesoutof40hintsgeneratedtobetruthfulacross
bothcontextsettings.
Since failing to detect a manipulative utterance can have far more severe consequences than mislabeling a truthful
utterance,recallisthecrucialmetricinthistask.Inourexperiments,inthehigh-contextsetting,Mixtral-8x7Bdetected
93%ofhintsconsideredmanipulative,whileGPT-4detected100%,whichshowstheirconsiderablepotential.
Weareawareoftheongoingresearchinthedomainsoffakenewsdetection[56]andautomatedfact-checking[57],
whicharecloselyrelatedtoourusecase. However,webelievethatdetectingmanipulativeutterancesisadistinctarea.
It should often be considered in a setting of multilateral exchange of statements, and it differs from a fact-checking
task by the importance of context and its ambiguity, i.e. a statement itself does not have to contain outright false
informationtobemanipulative.
The proposed solution of LLMs in the roles of Manipulation Fuses is not flawless and serves only as a proof of
concept. Theperformanceoftheclassifierscancertainlybeimprovedbypromptengineering,fine-tuning,ortraining

Furthermore, we want to note that the overall quantity of hints analyzed in RAMAI-LLM (Section 4) is not fully
satisfactory for statistical testing. Due to that, the analysis has a low resolution, and the obtained results should be
perceivedaspreliminaryandconfirmedinfurtherresearch.

B.2 Psycholinguisticcategories
In this part, we provide a more detailed description of LIWC psycholinguistic categories used to perform linguistic
analysis in the RAMAI-LLM section. In our work, we utilized the linguistic features which, according to Ta et al.
[51],arelinkedtopersuasion:
• WordCount-numberofwordsinthetext.
• Language Emotionality - metric including emotionality of the text categorized into three components: va-
lence,whichmeasuresthepleasantnessofastimulus;arousal,indicatingtheintensityofemotionalresponse
to a stimulus; and dominance, representing the extent of control wielded by a stimulus (e.g. benefit, love,
hostility)[58].
• LanguageAbstractionorConcreteness-anindicatorthatcanassesstheextenttowhichpeopleexpresstheir
abstractorconcretethoughtsinlanguageusage[59].
• AnalyticalThinking-metricassessinghowindividualsemployvocabularyindicativeofstructured,rational,

• LexicalDiversity-thediversityofvocabularyassessedthroughtheratioofuniquetokenstothetotalnumber

• Hedges - words or phrases indicating uncertainty through their lack of precision and clarity (e.g. small

Figure 9: Scatter plot showing precision and recall for each model as a generator and a fuse in the high-context
setting. Colors on the plot indicate which model was a fuse and letters which model was a generator. The values
in the parenthesis next to the names of the generators show the percentage of utterances of a given model deemed
manipulativebyhumanannotators.
As can be seen in both figures, letters tend to line up horizontally, not vertically. At the moment, we consider two
