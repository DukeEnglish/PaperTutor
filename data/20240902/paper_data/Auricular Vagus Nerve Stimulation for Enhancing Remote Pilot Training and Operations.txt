Abstract
The rapid growth of the drone industry, particularly in the use of small unmanned aerial systems
(sUAS) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), requires the development of advanced training
protocols for remote pilots. Remote pilots must develop a combination of technical and cognitive
skills to manage the complexities of modern drone operations. This paper explores the integration
of neurotechnology, specifically auricular vagus nerve stimulation (aVNS), as a method to enhance
remote pilot training and performance. The scientific literature shows aVNS can safely improve
cognitive functions such as attention, learning, and memory. It has also been shown useful to
manage stress responses. For safe and efficient sUAS/UAV operation, it is essential for pilots to
maintain high levels of vigilance and decision-making under pressure. By modulating sympathetic
stress and cortical arousal, aVNS can prime cognitive faculties before training, help maintain focus
during training and improve stress recovery post-training. Furthermore, aVNS has demonstrated
the potential to enhance multitasking and cognitive control. This may help remote pilots during
complex sUAS operations by potentially reducing the risk of impulsive decision-making or
cognitive errors. This paper advocates for the inclusion of aVNS in remote pilot training programs
by proposing that it can provide significant benefits in improving cognitive readiness, skill and
knowledge acquisition, as well as operational safety and efficiency. Future research should focus
on optimizing aVNS protocols for drone pilots while assessing long-term benefits to industrial
safety and workforce readiness in real-world scenarios.

The iconographic illustrations depict some example applications of sUAS/UAVs that are creating an impact on many
different industries. The development and deployment of different types of sensors and edge computing methods has
led to a growing adoption of drones for remote applications. This broadening use of semi-autonomous sUAS/UAVs
in commercial, security, and defense applications means workforce and talent development efforts will also grow to
include the establishment of RP training programs and certifications. Some training programs will incorporate modern
neurotechnology methods, such as auricular vagus nerve stimulation to enhance RP cognition and performance.
Like the growth of drone industry, the noninvasive vagus nerve stimulation (VNS)
field of neuroengineering has also have been shown to enhance learning during
experienced recent growth. There have been pilot training, as well as pilot operations in

equipped with numerous features including obstacle avoidance and flow sensors, gyroscopes and accelerometers,
global positioning system (GPS) sensors, many types of optical, infrared, and multi-spectral cameras, as well as other
sensors and actuators. A. Several different types of drone quadcopters or small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS) are
shown in addition to various controller interfaces. The DJI Mavic Mini drone (left) is shown with a handheld remote-
control system, which includes flight joysticks and a display for GPS information, navigation data, speed, altitude,
battery information, and a real-time video feed from a CMOS camera sensor. The DJI Avata 2 (middle) is shown with
a first-person view (FPV) head-mounted display and a motion sensitive controller. Using the sUAS configuration
shown, RPs navigate and control the drone using a combination of motion gestures and buttons while using FPV visual
inputs streamed from the drone. The drone ground control system (right) shows a more sophisticated mobile control
center with a RF antenna for streaming analog information including video feeds and sensor data. B. Larger versions
of sUAS systems are shown to illustrate broad applications. The Teledyne FLIR SIRAS (left) is an industrial
quadcopter drone capable of thermal imaging for inspection, surveillance, search, and rescue operations. The Delair
UX11 fixed-wing drone (middle) was designed for professional mapping applications while achieving long flight
ranges. The DJI Agras T40 (right) is another sUAS quadcopter capable of higher payloads designed for agricultural
applications including mapping, inspection, and spraying. The sUAS/UAVs shown in A and B all require different
skills, levels of attention, and cognitive engagement ranging from simple to complex. The drones illustrated represent
a small fraction of the types of aerial drones available to industry and consumers.

approaches to conducting auricular vagus nerve stimulation (aVNS) have been developed. From human factors and
biomedical engineering perspectives, these aVNS methods use different skin-electrode coupling methods. Ensuring
user comfort is critical to aVNS efficacy as any distracting or uncomfortable sensations will produced a confounding
increase in sympathetic arousal. A. Some aVNS methods and devices utilize metal clip electrodes like the clip (Soterix
Medical, Inc) shown on the left. These clips are used to mechanically couple the skin to a metal electrode using an
electrolyte solution or gel. This approach creates a distracting pinching sensation and can produce electrical biting or
prickling sensations. The Xen (Neuvana, Inc) aVNS device shown (middle-left) implements a different skin-electrode
coupling approach using a saline-sprayed conductive rubber electrode placed in the left external acoustic meatus. This
creates a distracting wet feeling in the ear of users. Due to body motion, fluid flux, absorption, and dehydration this
wet coupling method also leads to electromechanical distortions in the fluid coupling layer between hard charge carrier
(i.e. metal electrode) and irregular surfaces of the skin. A problem in general for the entire field of bioelectronics,
electromechanical mismatches between the electrode and soft, sensitive skin lead to local electrical hotspots and cause
distracting sensations or discomfort for the user. Other aVNS methods like the Nemos device (Cerbomed GmbH)
shown middle-right use small, steel ball electrodes that can produce high current densities resulting in discomfort or
electrical biting and stinging sensations. The Tinnoff device (SaluStim Group) shown at right features a different type
of aVNS clip electrode that can cause distracting sensations as discussed. B. Images of the BRAIN Buds aVNS
electrodes (IST, LLC) shown in the left and middle panels were developed as conductive hydrogel earbud electrodes
to produce an easy-to-use, comfortable user-experience. To overcome the electromechanical problems when coupling
electrodes to the skin discussed, materials and bioelectronics engineers have recently developed soft hydrogels that
mimic the electrical, thermal, and mechanical properties of skin. Using conductive hydrogels to couple electrodes to
the skin results in more uniform current distributions and enhanced user comfort during transcutaneous electrical
stimulation. As shown on the right, BRAIN Buds were designed as a bilateral aVNS system to be used like earbud
headphones.

that can be annoying or distracting. These distracting sensations that may reduce VNS
mismatches are aggravated by wet coupling efficacy [51]. Methods that use small metal
methods, which use a saline spray or electrode balls or other small area of
electrolyte gel coating on conductive rubber skin/metal contact can produce high current
or metal electrodes. In this case, due to body densities resulting in uncomfortable
motion, fluid flux, and dehydration, the sensations during stimulation. Metal or

(aVNS) to enhance human drone interactions and RP performance. B. aVNS enables bottom-up modulation of higher
brain regions by influencing nuclei of the ascending reticular activating system. The schematic illustration shows brain
circuits and general concepts involved in the bottom-up regulation of neural networks to enhance plasticity and
performance using aVNS. The delivery of pulsed electrical currents across the skin of the ear can modulate the activity
of cranial and cervical nerves (blue pathways). The trigeminal, cervical, facial, and vagus nerves send afferent inputs
to the trigeminal nucleus sensory complex (TNSC) and nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) in the brain stem. These
first nuclei then send projections to higher nuclei of the ascending reticular activating system (RAS). The RAS
includes pedunculopontine nuclei (PPN), the locus coeruleus (LC), and raphe nuclei (RN), which transmit
acetylcholine (ACh), norepinephrine (NE), and serotonin (5-HT) respectively to various parts of the brain. These
regions and processes highlighted in red serve as the chief control centers in the brain for regulating arousal, attention,
learning, memory, sleep onset, and stages of sleep. Changes in these networks and brain regions produced by aVNS
can enhance RP training and performance by improving stress responses, attention, learning, memory, cognitive
control, multitasking, and decision making. In the future, biosensors measuring attention, cognitive load, and stress
