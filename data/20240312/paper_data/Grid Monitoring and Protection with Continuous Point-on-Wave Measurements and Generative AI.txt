Overthepastdecades,thepowergridhasundergoneunprecedentedchanges,fromone
with high-inertial synchronous generators dispatched to follow predictable demands
to one with substantial non-dispatchable stochastic renewable resources integrated
into the grid via power electronics operating at the nano-second time scale. With
highlyvariableinverter-basedresources(IBRs)suchaswind/solarandreducedsystem
inertia, the grid is increasingly stochastic and dynamic, frequently operating near
its limits. Externally, accelerated occurrences of climate-related events put enormous
stress on the aging grid. Outage events increased by 78% in the decade of 2011-2021
over the previous one [1], causing an average annual economic loss of over 150 billion
dollars [2].
Not all outages can be prevented, but it begs the question: How many outages
can be mitigated, load sheds restored quickly, and economic impacts minimized with
today’stechnologyandadvancesincomputing,networking,andartificialintelligence?

and high-fidelity grid monitoring and protection beyond the capability of the state-
of-the-art synchrophasor technology. To this end, we present an AI-enabled data-

1.1 Beyond PMU with CPOW Measurements
At the outset, it is highly relevant to address a cogent question: why should one
consider new types of measurements when the phasor measurement units (PMUs)
and synchrophasor technology can already provide synchronized measurements with
resolutionshigherthanthestate-of-the-artSCADAmeasurements?WhatcanCPOW
measurements reveal that SCADA and PMU measurements cannot?
PMU was invented over thirty years ago as a technology for wide-area situational
awareness.ThenumberofPMUsdeployedinutilitiesintheUSfinallysurpassed3000
in2022,farfromadequatetocovertheoperationfootprintofasmalltomedium-sized
systemoperator.Afterthreedecadesof(mostlygovernmental)investmentsworldwide
and decades of extensive research, the technology has yet to take off. The unfulfilled
promise of PMU is not because its technology is ahead of its time; PMU is based on
the digital signal processing and the global positioning technologies of the seventies
and eighties; both are inexpensive and widely used in commercial sensing and com-
munication devices, including miniature wearable devices such as smartwatches and
earbuds. It is difficult to foresee that PMU technologies can make significant impacts
on reducing and preventing future blackouts.
One technical reason for the lack of deployment is that the 10 to 250 Hz reporting
ratesofthestate-of-the-artPMUcoveronlyasmallfractionofsignificantgridevents,
asshowninFig.1.Inparticular,PMUextractscurrentandvoltagephasorsassociated
with the fundamental frequency of 50 or 60 Hz, removing the frequency contents

outside a narrow frequency band around the fundamental frequency. As such, PMU
measurements are insensitive to most grid event waveforms shown in Fig. 1, unable
to capture critical grid events when the network is under stress while producing too
muchdatawhenthegridisnormal.Thereisalsotheeconomicreasonforthechicken-
and-eggtrap:insufficientmonitoringresolutionandcoveragemakePMUineffectiveas
a practical wide-area monitoring of impactful events, and the lack of compelling use
cases limits necessary investments and broad deployments to realize its potential.
Interestingly, CPOW data are ubiquitous in modern grids in the form of direct
Nyquist-sampledcurrentandvoltagewaves.Measurementsatalldigitalsensors,intel-
ligent electronic devices (IEDs), PMUs, digital relays, and digital fault recorders are
allCPOWdatawithsufficientlyhighsamplingratestocapturehighlydynamicsignal
waveforms from grid events. These high-resolution data rarely go beyond substations
for grid situational awareness. Why not use CPOW data for high-resolution moni-
toring and control then? The common wisdom has been that (i) streaming CPOW
measurements requires substantial infrastructure investments and bandwidth alloca-
tion; (ii) when the grid is in normal operating conditions, even PMU measurements
are not ”useful” most of the time. Why go with a technology with 10 to 100 times
higher data rates?
The inadequate bandwidth argument against high-resolution CPOW streaming
is unconvincing with today’s technology. Since the invention of PMU, the rate of
communications has increased by nearly six orders of magnitude, and the world of
communicationshasgrownfromzerocellphonesto5G/6Gdigitalcellular,fromtext-
basedcommunicationstoreal-timestreamingoflivesportsevents.Underlyingallthese
3are signal processing and networking technologies that deliver high-fidelity entertain-
ment and real-time control of robots, autonomous vehicles, and drones. If there are
data communications technology barriers, they are by no means insurmountable.
Theeconomicargumentdeservesmorecarefuldeliberation.Indeed,itseemswaste-
ful to allocate bandwidth for contingencies that occur on rare occasions. It is also
true that efficient data analytic methods are needed to sieve through large amounts
of data in searching for early signs of network instability and actionable information.
However,nothavinghigh-resolutiondataessentialforabroadspectrumofgridevents

While not deployed in practice, the idea of using CPOW data for grid monitor-
ing has been considered in the literature in recent years [6, 9–12]. Recent reviews of
synchronized CPOW technology (a.k.a synchro-wave) are [13, 14], where the authors
articulate broad visions of using CPOW data for monitoring, protection, and control.

1.2 Scope, Contributions, and Organization
This paper addresses two challenges in future grid monitoring systems: (i) efficient
compression and communications for real-time streaming of CPOW measurements
within the current bandwidth limits for PMU streaming technology and (ii) rapid
and reliable detection of faults and novel trends from highly stochastic CPOW
measurements.
Themaincontributionofthisworkistwofold.First,wedevelopanovelcompression
architecture that combines machine-learning-based data analytics and data compres-
sion for CPOW data streaming. Such technology is critical for bandwidth-efficient,
dynamic, and interactive operations among IEDs, substations, and the control center
during severe grid events. Second, we propose a sequential detection approach for the
reliable and rapid detection of anomalies and novel trends from CPOW data stream-
ing. Built on the classic innovation representation of time series pioneered by Wiener
andKallianpur,theproposedgenerativemachinelearningtechniquedistinguishesthe
normal and the faulty in the feature domain of the underlying probability distri-
butions of CPOW data, in contrast to conventional methods that directly compare
current and voltage phasors with their nominal values. Finally, we apply the pro-
posed anomaly detection approach to over-current protection in distribution systems,
where the presence of distributed stochastic generations causes protection blinding
and sympathetic tripping. We demonstrate 16% improvements in detection accuracy
and 67.9% in detection speed.

data compression and anomaly detection. In particular, anomaly detection problems

2 Learning Innovation Representations
The proposed AI-powered monitoring and anomaly/novelty detection approaches are
rooted in the classic idea of innovation representation of time series first proposed by
Wiener and Kallianpur [3], who made a profound conjecture that stationary random
processes can be represented by an IID uniform (or Gaussian) innovation sequence.
By removing temporal dependencies and converting a generic stationary process to
a canonical IID sequence with simple uniform/Gaussian marginals, the innovation
representationisarguablythemostefficientrepresentationofanonparametricrandom
process.
2.1 Wiener-Kallianpur Innovation Representation
In the parlance of modern machine learning, an innovation representation of a sta-
tionary random process (X ) is a causal autoencoder shown in Fig. 2, with the latent
t
process (V ) being an IID-uniform innovation sequence. As suggested by the word
t
innovation, V represents the new information contained in X not present in (i.e.,
t t
statistically independent of) the past X ={X ,X ,···}.
0:t t−1 t−2
Mathematically, the innovation representation of the time series is defined by a
pair of causal mappings (G,H) and the innovation sequence (V ):

The idea of innovation representation became popular in engineering in the 1960s
[15], especially in signal processing and control. The measurement-update step in
Kalman filtering is an example of how innovations are used in estimation, prediction,
and control. Despite the generality of the Wiener-Kallianpur innovation represen-
tation, its practical applications are limited to Gaussian and additive Gaussian
models—theonlytwocaseswhencausalautoencoder(G,H)canbeconstructedexplic-
itlyandimplementedinpractice.Nogeneralcomputationallytractablewaytoextract
the innovations sequence exists, even when the underlying probability distributions
of (X ) are known. Outside the recent work of [16], no existing work is capable of
t
learning the innovation representation.
2.2 Learning Innovation Representation
In [16], the authors proposed a generative adversary network (GAN) based approach
tolearningtheWiener-Kallianpurinnovationrepresentationbyjointlyminimizingthe
Wasserstein distance between the latent process and the uniform IID process and the
mean-squarederror(l distance)oftheautoencoderoutputasanestimateoftheinput.

Related Work
The detection model (4) belongs to the category of nonparametric hypothesis testing
[17], for which classical approaches in statistics generally assume known probability
model P under H . Standard techniques such as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and

Modern machine learning removes the assumption of known probability models
under both H and H , though techniques specializing in anomaly/novelty detec-

tion in time series are limited because the probability structures for nonparametric
time series are infinite-dimensional. Standard approaches reduce the problem to a
finite-dimensionalapproximationbyconsideringfinite-durationsegmentsoftimeseries
samples.See,e.g., [19–21].Suchsegmentationsoverlookthetemporaldependenciesof
the time series, which are crucial in anomaly/novelty detection unless the segments
are chosen to be very large. This results in a long detection delay and intractable
computation complexity.
With an unknown probability model under H , the state-of-the-art approaches
0
roughly fall into three categories. One is based on classifiers such as the one-class
support vector machine [22] and its many variants for different applications [23–25].
Such techniques implicitly assume that the support of the anomalous CPOW data
distribution is largely disjoint from that of the anomaly-free. With only training data
under H , these techniques perform poorly when anomaly and anomaly-free models
0
have overlapping support domains.
8The second group of techniques simulates samples under H using hypothetical
1
distributions some distance away from that under H [26–28]. It is, however, difficult

to capture all possible alternative distributions. The third category captures many
machinelearningsolutionsdevelopedinrecentyears,wherethedetectionisperformed
in a transformed “feature domain”, where some types of confidence scores on the
learned anomaly-free model are used to detect anomaly [29–32]. As shown in [33],
however, even with the perfect density estimate, detection may still perform poorly.

Detection via Innovation Representation
The approach presented here is based on the innovation representation discussed in
Sec. 2 and was originally developed in [16, 43]. The most striking feature of the
innovation-basedanomalydetectionisthattheinnovationautoencodertransformsthe
problem of anomaly detection with an unknown probability model under H to one
0
under the known and simple model of IID uniform (or Gaussian). The new contribu-
tion here is the application of Neyman’s Smooth Test (NST) for anomaly detection
and a sequential technique for quick detection.

While the underlying hypothesis testing problem remains challenging because of the

3 Compression and Data Analytic Architecture
This section presents an innovation-based compression and data analytic architecture
that combines subband coding, innovation representation, and local/central anoma-
ly/novelty detection. The schematic of the proposed compression system is shown in
Fig. 5 with key components explained next.
The upper branch of Fig. 5 is the schematic for an IED that takes analog curren-
t/voltage measurement x(t). Power system signals are narrow passband signals with
special subband spectral structure illustrated in Fig. 5. Around the fundamental fre-
quency ±f is the fundamental frequency band regulated with frequency deviations

due to nonlinear devices in the network. There may also be inter-harmonic frequency
componentsrepresentedbythegreyarea.Higher-orderharmonicsandinter-harmonics
may appear sporadically; they are modeled as on-off random processes.
Subband Coding
The A/D converter samples x(t) at the Nyquist rate to obtain a digital CPOW sig-
nal x[n]. Depending on the spectral bandwidth of x(t), the Nyquist sampling rate is
typically in the tens of kHz (or higher) range, resulting in more than 600 K samples
per cycle. The subband coding scheme proposed in [5] greatly reduces the Nyquist-
sampled data rate via the subband decomposition and encodes each harmonic (and
inter-harmonic) subband separately. By the passband Nyquist sampling theorem, a
harmonicsubbandwithpassbandbandwidthW requiresonlya2W samplingrate.For
instance, if the fundamental subband has the bandwidth of W =1 (Hz), one sample
0
per30cyclesissufficienttocapturethesignalinthefundamentalfrequencybandfully.
Foranmharmonic-subbandspectrum,eachwithW Hzpassbandbandwidth,mW/30
samples per cycle are sufficient for lossless compression. The subband coding block
extractsthebasebandcomponentsofX(f),down-samplingtheNyquist-sampleddata
to achieve two to three orders of magnitude data rate reduction. The subband coding
technique is well developed for multi-media compression and is embedded in practical
audio/video communications data-streaming technologies. The subband encoder pro-
posed in [5] can be easily implemented by off-the-shelf filter banks. See details in [5].
Notetheper-cycledatasamplesofthesubbandCPOWsignals{(x [n])}arebaseband
i
representations of the signal spectrum, typically at the rate of less than one sample
per cycle under normal operating conditions.
11Innovation Autoencoder and Local Data Analytics
While the subband coding scheme significantly reduces the data rate of the direct
Nyquist sampled (x[n]), further data rate reductions can be achieved through
information-theoretic approaches that offer an optimal tradeoff between the compres-
sion rate and distortions of reconstruction. Additional data rate reduction can be
achieved through local data analytics that adaptively selects harmonic subbands for
transmission. For instance, harmonic and inter-harmonic subbands may be inactive
under normal operating conditions. During significant network events, signal contents
from only a few harmonic subbands may be informative.
TheinnovationautoencoderdiscussedinSec.2isusedtotransformsubbandsignals

sequences. For minimum data compression over the typical additive Gaussian noise
channel of the utility network, it is natural that the innovation sequence (v [n]) is IID
i
Gaussian with matching mean and variance with (x [n]), from which optimal bits-
i
allocation to each subband innovations can be determined. This is discussed as part
of the vector quantization encoder in Sec. 3.
The local data analytics unit detects anomalies and novelties using techniques
presented in Sec. 2.3. The local data analytics unit produces the local state sequence
(s ) that can be used to compress data further and provide summary statistics for
t
the control center. Specifically, (s ) may include the normal/fault state sequence and
t
estimated fault locations when faults are detected locally. Under the normal system
state, data from many subbands can be suppressed, and the control center can recall
the suppressed signal if necessary.

which the estimation error is controlled by D in the rate-distortion function.
Central Data Analytics and Interactive Networking
Integrating data analytics with compression and networking provides the key com-
ponent for interactive networking: the local IEDs can initiate the interaction based
on local detection and transmit anomalous waveforms. Likewise, with the received
data feeds from multiple IEDs, the central data analytics unit can initiate requests
for high-resolution data when data feeds result in ambiguities and inference with low
confidence. Here, we do not discuss networking protocols that realize such interactive
networking.
4 Over-current Fault Detection and Protection
Traditional power system protection is based on a deterministic power system model.
Forshortcircuitfaults,apre-determinedthreshold(thepickupcurrent)issetsuchthat
current flows exceeding the threshold trigger relay actions. The significant presence
of distributed stochastic generations and IBRs causes two types of erroneous relay
actions.Oneistheso-calledprotectionblindingshownontheleftpanelofFig.6,where
the stochastic distributed generation (SDG) offsets the high current flow through the
protection device (PD), causing Type II (miss-detection) error in PD’s decision. The
second type is the sympathetic tripping shown on the right panel of Fig. 6, where the
PD experiences high current flow from SDG, causing a Type I (false alarm) error and
a PD’s unnecessary tripping action.

to this category design pickup current settings corresponding to different DG output
levels, and the DG conditions are usually classified via data-driven methods [55]. In
[56], fuzzy logic is applied to determine the DG working states and transferred to
relays to adjust their setting. The authors of [57] applied wavelet transformation to

4.1 Innovation-Based Sequential Fault Detection
Weproposeaninnovation-basedsequentialfaultdetection(ISFD)approachtoreduce
protection errors and decision time. ISFD is a data-driven approach that makes test-
ing decisions based on the latent process of the innovation autoencoder trained with
anomaly-free realizations of possibly multiple stochastic CPOW measurements. In
contrast, conventional techniques typically compare current phasor magnitudes with
a pre-determined threshold. Such approaches are vulnerable to stochastic distributed
generations,resultinginhighfalsepositiveandnegativeratesthatleadtosympathetic
trippingandprotectionblinding,respectively.ISFDusesempiricaldistribution-related
statisticstoseparatenormalfromfaultymeasurementswhen,inthetimedomain,the
waveform corresponding to the two cases is very close. This is an instance in which
choosing the right feature for detection is crucial.
ISFD is designed to achieve short detection delay by implementing a sequential
version of NST based on the classical notion of change detection. When distribution
statistic shows that the distribution of observed CPOW has a large distance from the
normaldistributionP underH ,theprocedureterminatesquicklybydeclaringfault.

When the observed CPOW is close to P under H , the observed data will likely be

ISFD implements the above sequential procedure using the so-called doubling
search technique [62]. At each iteration, ISFD executes NST with a fixed-sized batch
of samples. If the output of the detecting technique is H , the batch size will be dou-

4.2 Performance Evaluations
Simulation setting
We evaluated the performance of ISFD and two competing methods using the IEEE
13-bus distribution network shown in Fig. 7. To account for randomness in the mea-
surementsintroducedbyrenewableenergyresources,weaddeda1MWDGcontrolled
byreal-worldcurrentprofilecollectedatthemicro-gridlocatedinEPFLbetweennode
692 and 675. The DG was driven by EPFL’s current profile at the battery connec-
tion1,andcurrentmeasurementsampleswerecollectedat50KHzsamplingfrequency.
The entire system is simulated through MATLAB/Simulink.
Fig. 7 shows multiple fault scenarios considered in the simulation study, with red
arrowsindicatingfaultlocationsandblueboxesfortheprotectiverelays.Wesimulated
single-phase short circuit faults for each fault location, using MATLAB Simulink to
generate CPOW measurements. Specifically, fault F1 and F3 were chosen to test the
impact of SDG under sympathetic tripping whereas F2 was chosen to evaluate the
system’s performance under protection blinding.
When a single-phase short circuit fault happens at F1, R3 is the primary relay
for F1 and R2 a backup. During F1, sympathetic tripping at R4 may occur because
the current feed from SDG downstream could increase significantly. Similarly, when
F3 happens, R4 is also subject to sympathetic tripping due to current flow from
downstreamDG.Inthiscase,theprimaryrelayisR2andthebackupR1.Ontheother

hand, the primary relay R5 for fault scenario F2 faces protection blinding because of
DG’s support for current and voltage at R5 during fault at F2.
Algorithm Implementations and Performance Metrics
We compared ISFD with two overcurrent protection baselines: (i) the “conventional”
over-current relay protection with predetermined a fixed pickup current and inverse
time function defined by the IEEE 37112 standard [63], and (ii) AOCR—an adaptive
methodproposedin[64]–withpickupcurrentasalinearfunctionof10-secondmoving-
average current and minimum fault current in the zone.
All three methods required detection threshold settings. The ISFD threshold can
beobtainedanalyticallyforagivenfalsepositiverate(FPR).Incontrast,thethreshold
settings for the conventional and AOCR methods were obtained empirically through
simulations to meet the FPR target.
Intheexperiments,ISFDwasimplementedbasedona4th-orderNeyman’ssmooth
test with the doubling search procedure as described in Algorithm 1. We chose C =
42.5 and λ = 20. We generated 10,000 samples under the anomaly-free condition for
innovationautoencodertraining.WeadoptedAdamoptimizerwithlr =1e−5totrain
the innovation autoencoder. The threshold of the conventional method and AOCR
are chosen manually to cap the FPR at 0.05. The inverse-time characteristics of these
two over-current relay-based methods are chosen according to the moderately inverse
characteristics in IEEE standard [63].
We evaluate the performance of each protection scheme by True Positive Rate
(TPR), False Positive Rate (FPR), and detection delays. For each fault scenario, we
conducted1,000independentrunsofthesamesystem,drivingtheSDGcurrentprofile
with 1,000 different trajectories learned from the EPFL dataset. The trajectories
were learned through a weaker version of innovation autoencoder (WIAE) with the l

distance.WIAEwastrainedbytheEPFLcurrentprofile,andSDGcurrenttrajectories
from the same distribution as the EPFL current profile can then be drawn as the
output sequence (Xˆ ) of the decoder. The detailed implementation of WIAE can be

17True Positive Rate of Detection: From the TPR column evaluated under faults
F1, F2, and F3, respectively, the primary and backup relays should trip for all faults.
We see that ISFD achieved the best detection accuracy for the primary and backup
relays whenever a relay served as either a primary or a backup under all three faults.
For example, under F1, the fault detection rate is 100% at the primary relay R3 and
99.91% at the backup relay R2. Similar performance were observed under F2 and F3.
ISFD did have sympathetic tripping due to false positive detection at Relay R4 7.8%
of the time due to the presence of SDG.
Both AOCR and the conventional did not perform well at the primary relay R3
under all three faults with detection rates under 90%. At the backup relays, AOCR
and the conventional performed well under F1 but insufficient under F2 and F3.
Sympathetic tripping occurred 100% of the time under F1 and F3.
False Positive Rate of Detection: All methods achieved FPR smaller than 5%,
since we computed their corresponding decision threshold by setting their empirical
FPRs to be 0.05, analytically or empirically. In particular, for ISFD, the decision
threshold is computed analytically, and its FPR under all cases is smaller than 5%,
showing that the innovation autoencoder transformer current measurements to IID
uniform samples effectively.
Detection Delay: The delay column shows how quickly the detection decisions were
rendered by the three methods. ISFD significantly outperformed both AOCR and the
conventional,reducingthedetectiontimeby90%atprimaryrelays.Atbackuprelays,
ISFDperformedbetterformostcasesexceptunderF1(worsethanAOCR)andunder
F2 (comparable with the conventional).

Test statistics under ISFD: For ISFD, we plotted the histogram of the innovation

The top row of the figure shows the histograms of the latent processes under three
faults. The bottom row shows the scatter plots of ISFD’s decision statistics.
The leftmost panel shows the case of F1 at R4 unrelated to F1. For this case, the

that the histograms of the latent processes were approximately uniform, indicating
that the observations were deemed normal. The scatter plots below show that the
Neyman smooth test statistics were below the threshold most of the time. Thus the
rates of positive tests was about 7% and 5%, respectively.
The middle panel shows the case of F2 at R5. As the primary relay, R5 should
trip with low detection delays. The top-middle figure shows that the distributions of
innovations under fault and no-fault cases exhibit clear distinctions. The anomaly-
free histogram was uniform, whereas the anomalous one showed significant deviation
from the uniform distribution. Consequently, Neyman smooth test statistics for the
anomalous case were mostly above the decision threshold, resulting in a TPR higher
than 98%.
Test statistics under the conventional method: For the conventional method,
the test statistic was based on the pickup current. We plotted the maximum current
magnitude in each decision block with decision threshold I , shown in Fig. 9.

In other words, the maximum current magnitude.
TheleftmostpanelshowsthecaseofF1atR4,wherethecurrentmagnitudeshowed
a slight increase due to the presence of SDG. This challenges the detection accuracy
of the conventional method, where the decision is made solely based on the current
magnitude. As seen from the leftmost panel of Fig. 9, since the magnitude of current
during fault at R4 is higher than its no-fault counterpart, R4 trips 100% of the times,
19leading to the sympathetic tripping phenomenon. A similar pattern is shown under
the case F3 at R4, as supported by the rightmost panel.
The middle panel displays the current magnitude under the case of F2 at R5. Due
to R5’s geographical closeness to the SDG, the no-fault current at R5 exhibits great
randomness, and the fault current is decreased compared to the no-SDG counter-
part, as supported by the middle panel of Fig. 9. Hence, achieving high TPRs while
maintaining FPRs smaller than 5% is not attainable with a single pre-set threshold.
Test statistics under AOCR: AOCR compares current maximum magnitude with
an adaptively chosen threshold. We plotted the difference between the maximum cur-
rent magnitude and the adaptively chosen thresholds in each decision block in Fig. 9.
A difference greater than 0 implies fault for AOCR.

mitigate the problem by choosing the threshold adaptively, it cannot accommodate
high volatility in SGD’s output power, thus resulting in lower detection accuracy.
5 Conclusion
The future power grid will be dominated by power electronics-operated energy
resourceswithfastdynamicsandrichstochasticity.Thestate-of-the-artgridmonitor-
ing and control is ill-equipped to address formidable challenges brought by large-scale
20integrationofrenewables,multi-sectorelectrification,andclimate-change-inducednat-
ural disasters. Therefore, next-generation monitoring must be based on synchronized
CPOW measurements to provide high-fidelity and high-resolution situational aware-
ness and control. To this end, this paper offers an approach to compression and
interactive networking of CPOW data streaming integrated with data analytics at
local IED and control centers.
