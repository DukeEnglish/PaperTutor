Abstract
We investigate the emergence of periodic behavior in opinion dynamics and its underlying geometry.
For this, we use a bounded-confidence model with contrarian agents in a convolution social network.
This means that agents adapt their opinions by interacting with their neighbors in a time-varying
social network. Being contrarian, the agents are kept from reaching consensus. This is the key
feature that allows the emergence of cyclical trends. We show that the systems either converge
to nonconsensual equilibrium or are attracted to periodic or quasi-periodic orbits. We bound the
dimension of the attractors and the period of cyclical trends. We exhibit instances where each orbit
is dense and uniformly distributed within its attractor. We also investigate the case of randomly
changing social networks.

1 Introduction
Muchoftheworkintheareaofopiniondynamicshasfocusedonconsensusandpolarization[3,
14]. Typical questions include: How do agents come to agree or disagree? How do exogenous
forces drive them to consensus? How long does it take for opinion formation to settle?
Largely left out of the discussion has been the emergence of cyclical trends. Periodic patterns
in opinions and preferences is a complex, multifactorial social phenomenon beyond the scope
of this work [24]. A question worth examining, however, is whether the process conceals
deeper mathematical structure. The purpose of this work is to show that it is, indeed, the
case.
This work began with a thought experiment and a computer simulation. The latter
revealedhighlyunexpectedbehavior,whichinturncompelledustosearchforanexplanation.
Our main result is a proof that adding a simple contrarian rule to the classic bounded-
confidence model suffices to produce quasi-periodic trajectories. The model is a slight variant
of the classic HK framework: a finite collection of agents hold opinions on several topics,
which they update at discrete time steps by consulting their neighbors in a (time-varying)
social network. The modification is the addition of a simple repulsive force field that keep
agents away from tight consensus. The idea is partly inspired by swarming dynamics. For
example, birds refrain from flocking too closely. Likewise, near-consensus on a large enough
scale tends to induce contrarian reactions among agents [1, 20]. Some political scientists
have pointed to contrarianism as one of the reasons for the closeness of some national
elections [19, 18].

symmetries in the networks. We prove that the condition is sufficient (though its necessity is
still open). Another mystery was why contrarian opinions tend to orbit toward an attractor
whose dimensionality is independent of the number of opinions held by a single agent. These
attracting sets are typically Minkowski sums of ellipses. They emerge algorithmically and
constitute a natural focus of interest in distributed computational geometry.
Our inquiry builds on the pioneering work of French [16], DeGroot [10], Friedkin &
Johnsen [17], and Deffuant et al. [9]. The model we use is a minor modification of the
bounded-confidence model model [5, 21]. A Hegselmann-Krause (HK) system consists of n
agents, each one represented by a point in Rd. The d coordinates for each agent i represent
their current opinions on d different topics: thus, d is the dimension of the opinion space.
At any (discrete) time, each agent i moves to the mass center of the agents within a fixed
distance r , which represents its radius of influence (Fig. 1). This step is repeated ad
i
infinitum. Formally, the agents are positioned at x (t),...,x (t)∈Rd at time t and for any

Interpreting each N (t) as the set of neighbors of agent i defines the social network G at
i t
time t. In the special case where all the radii of influence are equal (r =R), convergence
i
into fixed-point clusters occurs within a polynomial number of steps [4, 13, 25]. Computer
simulation suggests that the same remains true even when the radii differ but a proof has
remained elusive. For cyclical trends to emerge, the social networks require a higher degree
of underlying structure. In this work, we assume vertex transitivity (via Cayley graphs),
which stipulates that agents cannot be distinguished by their local environment. Before
defining the model formally in the next section, we summarize our main findings.
Undirected networks always drive the agents to nonconsensual convergence, ie, to fixed
points at which they “agree to disagree.” For their behavior to become periodic or
quasi-periodic,thesocialnetworksneedtobedirected. Weprovethatsuchsystemseither
converge or are attracted to periodic or quasi-periodic orbits. We give precise formulas
for the orbits.
We investigate the geometry of the attractors (Fig. 2). We bound the rotation number,
which indicates the speed at which (quasi)-periodic opinions undergo a full cycle. We
exhibitinstanceswhereeachlimitingorbitformsasetthatisdenseand,infact,uniformly
distributed on its attractor.
We explore the case of social networks changing randomly at each step. We prove
the surprising result that the dimension of the attractor can decrease because of the
randomization. This is a rare case where adding entropy to a system can reduce its
dimensionality.
The dynamics of contrarian views has been studied before [1, 11, 15, 19, 18, 20, 26] but, to
our knowledge, not for the purpose of explaining cyclical trends. Our mathematical findingsB. Chazelle, K. Karntikoon, and J. Nogler 3
can be viewed as a grand generalization of the affine-invariant evolution of planar polygons
studied in [6, 8, 12, 22].

2 Contrarian Opinion Dynamics
The social network is a time-dependent Cayley graph over an abelian group. All finite
abelian groups are isomorphic to a direct sum of cyclic groups (Z/n Z)⊕···⊕(Z/n Z).
1 m
For notational convenience, we set n = n. We regard the toral grid V = (Z/nZ)m as a
i
vector space, and we write N =|V|=nm. Let x (t) be the position of agent v in Rd at time
v
t. We fix x (0) and abbreviate it as x . Choose p such that 1/N < p < 1 and let (C )
v v t t≥0
be an infinite sequence of subsets of V. For technical convenience, we assume that each set
C spans the vector space V; hence |C | ≥ m. In the spirit of HK systems, we define the
t t
dynamics as follows: for t=0,1,...,
1−p X
x (t+1)=px (t)+ x (t). (2)
v v |C | w
t
w∈v+Ct
Becauseofthepresenceofthe“self-confidence”weightp,wemayassumethattheconvolution
set C does not contain the origin 0. If we view each x (t) as a row vector in Rd, the
t v
update (2) specifies an N-by-N stochastic matrix F . Let x(t) denote the N-by-d matrix
Ct
whose rows are the N agent positions x (t), for v ∈ V. We have x(t+1) = F x(t). The
v Ct
matrix F may not be symmetric but it is always doubly-stochastic. This means that the
Ct
mass center 1⊤x(t)/N is time-invariant. Since the dynamics itself is translation-invariant, we
are free to move the mass center to the origin, which we do by assuming 1⊤x=0⊤, where x
denotes x(0).
Obviously, some initial conditions are uninteresting: for example, x=0. For this reason,
we choose x randomly; specifically, each x is picked iid from the d−dimensional normal
v
distribution N(0,1). In the following, we use the phrase “with high probability,” to refer to
an event occurring with probability at least 1−ε, for any fixed ε>0. Once we’ve picked the
matrix x randomly, we place the mass center of the agents at the origin by subtracting its
displacement from the origin: x←x− 111⊤x.
N
The agents will be attracted to the origin to form a single-point cluster of consensus in
the limit. Responding to their contrarian nature, the agents will restore mutual differences
by boosting the own opinions. For that reason we consider the scaled dynamics: y(0)=x
and, for t≥0,
y(t+1)=ξ F y(t), (3)

2.1 Preliminaries

We define the directed graph G = (V,E ) at time t ≥ 0, where E = {(v,v+c)|v ∈
Ct t t
V,c∈C } and N ={(v,w)|w ∈v+C ⊆V}. For clarity, we drop the subscript t for the
t v t
remainder of this section; so we write C for C .

▶ Lemma 1. The convolution set C spans the vector space V if and only if the graph G is
C
strongly connected.
Proof. If C spans V, then for any pair u,v ∈ V, there exist a ∈ Z/nZ, for each h ∈ C,
h
such that v−u=P a h. The right-hand side specifies P a edges (sum taken over N)
h∈C h h h
that form a path from u to v ; therefore G is strongly connected. Conversely, assuming the
latter, there is a path from u to v: (w ,w ),...,(w ,w ), with w =u and w =v. Thus,
1 2 k−1 k 1 k
v−u=P c , where c =w −w ∈C; therefore C spans V. ◀
i i i i i−1
Our assumption about C implies that each G is strongly connected. The presence of
C
the weight p>0 in (2) ensures that the diagonal of F is positive. Together with the strong
C
connnectivity assumption, this makes the matrix F primitive, meaning that Fk >0, for
C C
somek >0. BythePerron-Frobeniustheorem[27],alltheeigenvaluesofF liestrictlyinside
C
the unit circle in C, except for the dominant eigenvalue 1, which has multiplicity 1. For any
u,v ∈V, we write ψv =ω⟨u,v⟩, where ω :=e2πi/n. We define the vector ψv =(ψv|u∈V)
u u
and easily verify that {ψv|v ∈V} forms an orthogonal eigenbasis for F . The eigenvalue λ
C v
corresponding to ψv satisfies
1−p X 1−p(cid:16)X (cid:17)
λ ψv =pψv + ψv =pψv + ψv ψv.

We conclude:
▶ Lemma 2. Each v ∈V corresponds to a distinct eigenvector ψv, which together form an
orthogonal basis for CN. The corresponding eigenvalue is given by
1−p X
λ =p+ ω⟨v,h⟩.
v |C|
h∈C
We define λ = max {|λ | < 1} and denote by W = {v ∈ V : |λ | = λ} the set of
v∈V v v
subdominant eigenvectors. The argument of λ plays a key role in our discussion, so we
v
define θ
v
such that λ
v
=|λ v|ωθv, with θ
v
∈(−n/2,n/2]. By (6), λ
v
̸=0 for v ∈W, so θ
v
is
well defined.
2.2 The evolution of opinions
We begin with the case of a fixed convolution set C = C. The initial position of the
t
agents is expressed in eigenspace as x= 1 P ψv(ψv)Hx. Let z denote the row vector
N v∈V v
(ψv)Hx=P ω−⟨v,u⟩x . Because (ψv)Hx=1⊤x=0⊤, for v =0∈V,

Ω 1/N =∥z ∥ =O dNlogdN .
v 2
Proof. Let a = (a ) be the first column of the matrix x. For each u ∈ V, by the
u u∈V
initialization of the system, a =ζ −δ, where ζ ∼N(0,1) and δ = 11⊤ζ. Given v ̸=0,
u u u N
ψv is orthogonal to ψ0 = 1; hence (ψv)Ha = (ψv)H(ζ −δ1) = (ψv)Hζ. Since the random
vector ζ is unbiased and |ω−⟨v,u⟩| = 1, it follows that var(cid:2) (ψv)Ha(cid:3) = P varζ = N.
u∈V u
Thus, the first coordinate z of z is of the form a+ib, where a and b are sampled (not
v,1 v
independently) from N(0,σ2) and N(0,σ2), respectively, such that σ2 +σ2 = N. Thus,
1 √ 2 1 2
|z |≤δ with probability at most 2δ/ πN. Conversely, by the inequality erfc(z)≤e−z2 for
v,1
p
z >0, we find that |z |=O( Nlog(dN/ε)), with probability at least 1−ε/dN, for any
v,1
p
0 < ε < 1; hence ∥z ∥ = O( dNlog(dN/ε)), with probability at least 1−ε/N. Setting
v 2
δ =εp π/4N and using a union bound completes the proof. ◀
We upscale the system by setting ξ =1/λ; hence y(t+1)=y(t)/λ.

▶ Theorem 4. Let a and b be the row vectors whose u-th coordinates (u ∈ V) are
h h
cos(2π⟨h,u⟩/n) and sin(2π⟨h,u⟩/n), respectively. With high probability, for each v ∈V, the
agent v is attracted to the trajectory of y∗(t), where

Let µ := max{|λ |/λ < 1} be the third largest (upscaled) eigenvalue, measured in distinct

Proof. Since the eigenvalues sum up to trF = pN and 1 has multiplicity 1, we have

2.3 Geometric investigations
The trajectory y∗(t) is called the limiting orbit.1 Theorem 4 indicates that, with high
v
probability, every orbit is attracted to its limiting form at an exponential rate, so we may
focus on the latter. Given the initial placement x of the agents, all the limiting orbits lie in
the set S, expressed in parametric form by
S= 1 X (cid:8) (a x)cosX +(b x)sinX (cid:9) . (8)

Recall that a x and b x are row vectors in Rd. The attractor S is the Minkowski sum of a

that λ ̸=0 by (6), so there remain the following cases for the subdominant eigenvalues:

present in W. The contribution of an eigenvalue is the same as that of its conjugate since
a =a and b =−b . So the contribution of a given θ >0 is equal to e x, where

Proof of Theorem 5. Pick two distinct u,v ∈W. Applying Lemma 6 in the complex plane,

|C| h∈C |C| h∈C u v
implies that the segments Oe and Of are of the same length. Abusing notation by treating
a,b,c as both vectors and complex numbers, we have (b−a)·c=ℜ(b−a); therefore,
(cid:0) 2ℜ(b−a)+|a|2−|b|2(cid:1) p=|a|2−|b|2.
1. If 2ℜ(b−a)+|a|2 −|b|2 = 0, then |a| = |b|, which in turn implies that ℜ(b−a) = 0;

In some cases, regularity holds with no need to exclude values of p:

exactly two eigenvalues: p+ 1−p(ω−1) and its conjugate.

i h∈C
(1,0,...,0) appears for exactly one value v ∈V and the same is true of (−1,0,...,0). This
holds true of any one-hot vector with a single ±1 at any place and 0 elsewhere. This means
that, for 2m values of v, the eigenvalue λ is of the form p+ 1−p(m−1+ω) or its conjugate.

2.3.3 Opinion velocities
Assume that the system is regular, so W is associated with either a single real eigenvalue or
two complex conjugate ones. If ϑ=∅, by (12), every agent converges to a fixed point of the
attractor S or its limiting orbit has a period of 2. The other case ϑ={θ} is more interesting.
The agent approaches its limiting orbit, which is periodic or quasi-periodic. The rotation
number, α:=θ/n, is the (average) fraction of a whole rotation covered in a single step. It
measures the speed at which the agent cycles around its orbit. We prove a lower bound on
that speed.3

vector in {−1,0,1}N. It follows that β ψv =Aψv, for an N-by-N matrix A whose nonzero
v
elements are ±1 and whose rows are given by g⊤. Thus, β is an imaginary eigenvalue of A;
u v
hence a complex root of the characteristic polynomial det(A−γI). Let r ≥1 be the rank
of A and let γ ,...,γ be its nonzero eigenvalues. Expansion of the determinant gives us a

Our next result formalizes the intuitive fact that self-confidence slows down motion.
Self-assured agents are reluctant to change opinions.
▶ Theorem 10. The rotation number of a regular system cannot increase with p.
Proof. We must have |ϑ|=1. Let λ be (an) eigenvalue corresponding to the unique angle
h
in ϑ; recall that 0 < θ < n/2. As we replace p by p′ > p, we use the prime sign with all
h
relevant quantities post-substitution. Thus, the subdominant eigenvalue for p′ associated
with ϑ′ is denoted by λ′; again, we assume that |ϑ′|=1. Note that v might not necessarily
v
be equal to h; hence the case analysis:
3 Itsupperboundis1/2.10 The Geometry of Cyclical Social Trends
v =h: Using the same notation for complex numbers and the points in the plane they
represent (Fig. 5), we see that λ′ lies in (the relative interior of) the segment 1λ ; hence
h h
θ′ <θ .
h h
v ̸=h: We prove that, as illustrated in Fig. 5, all three conditions |λ |>|λ |, |λ′|<|λ′|,
h v h v
and θ <θ′ ≤n/2, cannot hold at the same time, which will establish the theorem. If we
h v
increase q continuously from p to p′, θ (q) decreases continuously. (We use the argument
h
q to denote the fact that θ corresponds to the eigenvalue defined with p replaced by
h
q.) Since, at the end of that motion, |λ (q)| < |λ (q)|, by continuity we have p < p′,
h v o
where p =min{q >p : |λ (q)|=|λ (q)|}. To simplify the notation, we repurpose the
o h v
use of the prime superscript to refer to p (eg, p′ =p ). So, we now have |λ′|=|λ′| and
o o h v
θ < θ′ < θ ≤ n/2. It follows that (i) the point λ lies in the pie slice of radius |λ |
h v v v h
running counterclockwise from λ to −|λ | on the real axis. Also, because |λ′| = |λ′|
h h h v
and |λ | > |λ |, setting c = 1 as before in Lemma 6 shows that (ii) ℜ(λ ) > ℜ(λ ).4

2.4 Equidistributed orbits
The attractor S is the Minkowski sum of a number of ellipses bounded by |W|. An agent
orbits around an ellipse as it gets attracted to it exponentially fast. In a regular system with
ϑ̸=∅, its limiting orbit is periodic if the unique angle θ of ϑ is rational; it is quasi-periodic
h
otherwise. In fact, it then forms a dense subset of the ellipse. By (12), this follows from
Weyl’s ergodicity principle [23], which states that the set {αt (mod 1),|t≥0} is uniformly
distributed in [0,1), for any irrational α.
Dropping the regularity requirement may produce more exotic dynamics. We exhibit
instances where a limiting orbit will not only be dense over the entire attracting set but, in
fact, uniformly distributed. In other words, an agent will approach every possible opinion
with equal frequency. This will occur when this property holds:5

▶ Assumption A. The numbers in ϑ∪{1} are linearly independent over the rationals.
We explain this phenomenon next. Order the angles of ϑ arbitrarily and define the vector
α = (α ,...,α ) ∈
(cid:2) 0,1(cid:3)s
, where s = |ϑ| and α = θ/n for the j-th angle θ ∈ ϑ. We may
1 s 2 j
assume that c =d =0 in (12) since these cases are rotationally trivial. By Assumption A,
v v
0 is the only integer vector whose dot product with α is an integer. We use the standard
notation ∥α∥R/Z =max k≤smin a∈Z|α k−a|. By Kronecker’s approximation theorem [7], for
any β ∈ [0,1]s and any ε > 0, there exists q ∈ Z such that ∥qα−β∥R/Z ≤ ε. It follows
directly that, with high probability, any limiting orbit is dense over the attractor S. We
prove the stronger result:
▶ Theorem 11. Under Assumption A, any limiting orbit is uniformly distributed over the
attractor S.
We mention that, in general, Assumption A might be difficult to verify analytically.
Empirically, however, density is fairly obvious to ascertain numerically with suitable visual
evidence (Fig. 6). We define the discrepancy D(S ) of S =(p ,...,p ), with p ∈Rs, as

difference from the previous case comes from the limit behavior of the agents. They are
not attracted to a fixed point but, rather, to a surface. With high probability, the orbits
are asymptotically periodic if θ is rational, and quasi-periodic otherwise. For a case of the
former, consider p=0, which gives us

3 Dynamic Social Networks
We define a mixed model of contrarian opinion dynamics. Let M={C ,...,C } be a set of
1 s
s nonempty subsets, each one spanning the vector space V. At each time step t, we define
the matrix F by choosing, as convolution set C, a random, uniformly distributed element of
C
M. As before, we assume that 1⊤x=0. Let λ be the eigenvalue of F associated with
j,v Cj
v ∈V. Given an infinite sequence I of indices from [s], we denote by I =k ,...,k be the
∞ t 1 t

λ = 1 lie strictly inside the unit circle, we have λ < 1. Without loss of generality, we
j,0
can assume that λ > 0. Indeed, suppose that λ = 0; then, for every v ∈ V \{0}, there is
j = j(v) such that λ = 0. This presents us with a “coupon collector’s” scenario: with
j,v
probability at most N(1−1/s)t ≤ Ne−t/s, we have Λ (I ) ̸= 0 for at least one nonzero
v t
v ∈V. In other words, with high probability, every coordinate of x(t) in the eigenbasis will
vanish after O(slogN) steps; hence x(t) = 0 for all t large enough. This case is of little
interest, so we dismiss it and assume that λ is positive. We redefine W ={v ∈V |λ× =λ}.

Note that the high-probability event applies to all times t larger than a fixed constant. The
proof involves the comparison of two multiplicative random walks.
Proof. Fix w ∈ W and w′ ∈ W′. We prove that |Λ (I )| ≤ ct|Λ (I )|. If λ× = 0, then
w′ t w t w′
λ =0, for some j. With high probability, the sequence I includes the index j at least
j,w′ t
once for any t large enough; hence |Λ (I )| = 0 and the lemma holds. Assume now that

λ× > 0; for all j, both of λ and λ are nonzero. Write S (I ) = logQ |λ |, for

small constant a > 0. Since P 1/t2 = π2/6, it follows that, for arbitrarily small fixed

3.2 Surprising attractors
Adding mixing to a model increases the entropy of the system. It is thus to be expected that
the attractor of a mixed model should have higher dimensionality than its pure components.
The surprise is that this need not be the case. We exhibit instances of contrarian opinion
dynamics where mixing decreases the dimension of the attractor. To keep the notation
simple, we consider two pure models M = {C }, M = {C } alongside their mixture
1 1 2 2
M ={C ,C }.
3 1 2
▶ Theorem 14. For any k ∈[m], there is a choice of C and C such that dimM =k and
1 2 3
dimM = dimM = m; in other words, the dimension of the mixture’s attractor can be
1 2
arbitrarily smaller than those of its pure components.
Proof. We define C =(e ,...,e ) and C =(e ,...,e ,2e ,...,2e ), for any k ∈[m],
1 1 m 2 1 k k+1 m
where e is the one-hot vector of V whose i-th coordinate is 1 and all the others 0. Let
i
W denote the set W corresponding to the system M . We easily verify that W = ±C
i i 1 1
and W = ±(cid:8) e ,...,e ,2−1e ,...,2−1e (cid:9) , where 2−1 is the inverse of 2 in the field

sets are C ={(1,0),(0,1)} and C ={(1,0),(0,2)}. The initial positions are random and
1 2
identical in all three cases.
We can generalize the mixed model by picking C (resp. C ) with probability 1−q (resp.
1 2
q), where 0≤q ≤1. For this, we redefine λ× v(q)=(cid:12) (cid:12)λ1 1− ,vqλq 2,v(cid:12) (cid:12) and λ(q)=max v∈V\{0}λ× v(q).16 The Geometry of Cyclical Social Trends

1 2 3 1 2
in other words, the dimension of the mixture’s attractor can be larger than those of its pure

Proof. Borrowing the notation of the previous proof, we define C = (e ,...,e ) and
1 1 m
C = (2e ,...,2e ) and verify that W = ±C and W = ±{2−1e ,...,2−1e (cid:9) ; hence

Regarding the mixed system, we have W(q)={v ∈V : λ×(q)=λ(q)}, where W(0)=W
v 1
and W(1)=W . Around q =0, we have, for all v ∈W(0),
2
(cid:12) 1−p (cid:12)1−q (cid:12) 1−p (cid:12)q
λ×(q)=(cid:12)1+ (ω−1)(cid:12) ×(cid:12)1+ (ω2−1)(cid:12) . (18)
v (cid:12) m (cid:12) (cid:12) m (cid:12)
Since W(0) ̸= W(1), by continuity, there are q ∈ (0,1) and w ∈ W(q)\W(0) such that
λ×(q) is equal to the right-hand side of (18). This implies that W(q)⊇W(0)∪{w}, which
w
completes the proof. ◀
Figure 11 illustrates the theorem. We have m = 2, n = 29, and p = 0.9. The two
convolution sets are C ={(1,0),(0,1)} and C ={(2,0),(0,2)}; the mixture probability is
1 2
q =0.0306. The initial positions are random and identical in all three cases.
