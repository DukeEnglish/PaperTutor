Abstract. Whilepersonalizedtext-to-imagegenerationhasenabledthe
learning of a single concept from multiple images, a more practical yet
challenging scenario involves learning multiple concepts within a single
image. However, existing works tackling this scenario heavily rely on
extensive human annotations. In this paper, we introduce a novel task
named Unsupervised Concept Extraction (UCE) that considers an un-
supervisedsettingwithoutanyhumanknowledgeoftheconcepts.Given
an image that contains multiple concepts, the task aims to extract and

that tackles UCE by unleashing the inherent capabilities of pretrained
diffusion models in two aspects. Specifically, a concept localization ap-

the lookup association between a concept and a conceptual token, a

paper, we try to provide an answer to this question by harnessing the potential
of Stable Diffusion [54] in concept extraction.

Fig.1: Unsupervised concept extraction. We focuson the unsupervisedproblem
of extracting multiple concepts from a single image. Given an image that contains
multiple concepts (e.g., Star Wars characters C-3PO, R2-D2, and desert), we aim to
harness a frozen pretrained diffusion model to automatically learn the conceptual to-
kens. Using the learned conceptual tokens, we can regenerate the extracted concepts

dencesuggeststheirunderlyingcapabilitiesinvarioustasks,includingclassifica-
tion[37],segmentation[28,44,66,69,76],andsemanticcorrespondence[22,39,81].
This indicates that diffusion models embed significant world knowledge, poten-
tially enabling them to perceive and recreate concepts akin to skilled painters.
Motivated by this insight, we delve into this problem and explore the untapped
potentialofStableDiffusion[54]inconceptextraction.Whilerecentresearch[2,
26]hasmadeinitialattemptsinexploringconceptextractionusingStableDiffu-
sion, existing approaches heavily rely on external human knowledge for supervi-
sion during the learning process. For example, Break-A-Scene [2] demands pre-
annotated object masks, while MCPL [26] requires accurate concept-descriptive
captions.However,thesehumanaidsarebothcostlyandofteninaccessible.This
criticalconstraintrendersexistingapproachesinfeasible,asnoneofthemextract
concepts without using any prior knowledge of the concepts.
To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel and challenging task named Unsu-
pervisedConceptExtraction (UCE).Givenanimagecontainingmultipleobjects,
UCE aims to automatically extract the object concepts such that they can be
used to generate new images. In UCE, we consider a strict and realistic “unsu-
pervised” setting, in which there is no prior knowledge about the image or the
concepts present within it. Specifically, “unsupervised” emphasizes (1) no con-
cept descriptors for proper word embedding initialization, (2) no object masks
for concept localization and disentanglement, and (3) no instance number for a
definite number of concepts to be extracted. We illustrate UCE in Fig. 1.
To tackle this problem, we introduce ConceptExpress, the first method
designedforunsupervisedconceptextraction.ConceptExpressunleashesthein-
herentcapabilitiesofpretrainedStableDiffusion,enablingittodisentangleeach
concept in the compositional scene and learn discriminative conceptual tokens
that represent each individual concept. ConceptExpress presents two major in-
novations. (1) For concept disentanglement, we propose a concept localization
approach that automatically locates salient concepts within the image. This ap-
proachinvolvesclusteringspatialpointsontheself-attentionmap,buildingupon

steps,namelypre-clustering,filtering,andpost-clustering,seamlesslyintegrating

Additionally, our approach automatically determines the number of concepts
based on self-adaptive clustering constraints. (2) For conceptual token learning,
weemployconcept-wisemaskeddenoisingoptimizationbyreconstructingthelo-
catedconcept.Thisoptimizationisbasedonatokenlookuptablethatassociates
eachlocatedconceptwithitscorrespondingconceptualtoken.Toaddresstheis-
sueofabsenceofinitialwords,whichcandetrimentallyimpactoptimization[16],
we introduce a split-and-merge strategy for robust token initialization, mitigat-
ing performance degradation. To prevent undesired cross-attention activation
with the wrong concept, we incorporate regularization to align cross-attention
maps with the desired concept activation exhibited in self-attention maps.
To evaluate the new UCE task, we construct a new dataset that contains
various multi-concept images, and introduce an evaluation protocol including
two metrics tailored for unsupervised concept extraction. We use concept simi-
larity, including identity similarity and compositional similarity, to measure the
absolute similarity between the source and the generated concepts. We also use
classificationaccuracytoassessthedegreeofconceptdisentanglement.Through
comprehensive experiments, our results demonstrate that ConceptExpress suc-
cessfully tackles the challenge of unsupervised concept extraction, as evidenced
by both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

optimizes the generated image at test time using CLIP similarity without any

and LDM [54]. Based on the implementation of LDMs [54], Stable Diffusion
(SD), large-scale trained on LAION-5B [59], achieves unprecedented text-to-
image synthesis performance. Diffusion models are widely used for various tasks
such as controllable generation [82,85], global [9,67] and local editing [3,5,13,

Generative concept learning Recently, many works [12,16,17,21,25,36,38,
42,48,55,60,65,73] have emerged, aiming to learn a generative concept from
multiple images. For example, Textual Inversion [16] learns an embedding vec-
tor that represents a concept in the textual embedding space. Liu et al. [40]4 S. Hao et al.
extended it to multi-concept discovery using composable diffusion models [15].
Theirworkoperatesinanunsupervisedsettinglikeours.However,thereisama-
jor difference: they extract concepts from multiple images, each containing only
one concept, whereas our focus is on extracting multiple concepts from a single
image. Our work is closely related to Break-A-Scene [2] which relies heavily on
human-annotated masks that are not available in our setting. The concurrent
works,MCPL[26]andDisenDiff[84],addressasimilarproblem,buttheyrequire

Attention-based segmentation Pre-trained Stable Diffusion [54] possesses
highly informative semantic representations within its attention layers. This
property effectively enables its cross-attention layers to indicate the interrela-

thespatialcorrespondenceamongimagetokens.Consequently,priorworks[7,28,
44,66,69,76]haveexploredtheutilizationofthepre-trainedStableDiffusionfor
semantic segmentation, showing remarkable performance in unsupervised zero-
shot segmentation. Diffsegmenter [69] and FTM [76] use cross-attention to ini-
tialize segmentation maps, and then extract affinity weights from self-attention
for further refinement. DiffSeg [66] achieves unsupervised zero-shot segmenta-
tionbyclusteringaggregatedself-attentionmaps.Theirinvestigationoftheself-

3 Unsupervised Concept Extraction
We aim to learn discriminative tokens that can represent multiple instance-level
concepts from a single image in an unsupervised manner. Specifically, given an
imageI containingmultiplesalientinstances,weuseapretrainedtext-to-image
diffusion model to discover a set of conceptual tokens S = {[V ]}N and their
i i=1
corresponding embedding vectors V = {v }N , which capture discriminative
i i=1
concepts from I. The concept number N is automatically determined in the
discovery process. By prompting the i-th token [V ] ∈ S, we can recreate the
i
corresponding concept extracted from I. We present ConceptExpress to tackle
this problem. Fig. 2 gives an overview of ConceptExpress.

self-attention maps from different layers into an identical resolution h×w, we
follow the practice in [66] to interpolate the last two dimensions, duplicate the

of which is an h×w dimensional distribution, i.e., A = {a | a ∈ Rh×w}h×w.

By clustering on A, we can naturally derive latent masks that align with the
semantic segmentation of the original image. This is because latent patches
sharing similar semantics tend to possess consistent self-attention activations.
Themasksareformedbycombiningspatialsamplesbelongingtothesameclus-
ter, effectively representing specific segments in the image. However, accurately
locating instance-level concepts and effectively filtering out the background re-
main challenging when our goal is to disentangle multiple instances rather than
solely segmenting semantics. To tackle this challenge, we adapt the hierarchical

We set the upper limit of the number of discovered concepts to N . We then

identify the clustering level with the cluster number N′ closest to but greater
than N . At this level, we construct a mask for each cluster from all spa-
max
tial points within the cluster. We denote the resulting masks as {m | m ∈
i i
{0,1}h×w}N′ . Since spatial samples within the same cluster share consistent
i=1
semantics, the distribution distance between them serves as an effective indi-
cator for distinguishing between different semantic instances. Therefore, we useConceptExpress 7
the largest intra-cluster distance at this level, denoted as δ, as a self-adaptive
threshold to determine the final clustering level in the post-clustering phase.
Filtering The obtained masks cover all areas on the latent map, encompass-
ing both the foreground instances with clear semantics and the indistinct back-
groundregions.Indiffusionmodels,thecross-attentionmapoftheend-of-textto-
ken([EOT])demonstratesrobustforegroundlocalizationcapabilities[21],where
salient regions exhibit higher magnitudes and vice versa. This characteristic
makes it suited for automatically distinguishing between distinct instances and
indistinct backgrounds. Let e∈Rh×w denote the cross-attention map of [EOT].
Based on e, we discard masks whose masked regions satisfy
∥vec(m ⊙e)∥ ∥vec(e)∥
i 1 < 1 (5)
∥vec(m )∥ h×w
i 1
where vec(·), ∥·∥ , and ⊙ denote matrix vectorization, ℓ norm, and Hadamard

productrespectively.Byapplyingthiscriterion,wefilteroutthosemaskswhose
masked regions show magnitudes lower than the average level, indicating that
they correspond to indistinct regions. This criterion helps identify and exclude
masks that correspond to indistinct regions in the [EOT] cross-attention map.
Post-clustering After filtering, we reapply FINCH to the remaining clusters
iteratively. Additionally, we introduce two extra constraints to determine the
stopping point in the clustering procedure. (1) To enhance the proximity of
semantic relationships within the same mask, we set G(i,j)=0 if the distance
d(a ,a ) exceeds δ, which is determined in the level with N′ clusters of pre-
i j
clustering. By removing such connections, we hinder the grouping of strong se-
manticvariationswithinthesamemask.(2)Weforbidnon-adjacentmasksfrom
grouping together, i.e., masks that are not spatially adjacent to each other can-
not be clustered together, regardless of their connectivity in G. With these two
constraints, the clustering will automatically terminate and yield N masks that
locate the latent spaces corresponding to the N target concepts. The mean at-
tentionactivationsofeachconceptregionispreciselythecentroidofeachcluster,
given by
f =m1×(h×w)·A(h×w)×(h×w) / ∥vec(m )∥ (6)

where the centroid f ∈R1×(h×w) represents the average attention activations of
i
i-th masked latent region to the entire h×w latent space. The latent masks and
their corresponding attention activations are ready for token optimization. The
concept localization process is visualized in Fig. 3 (left).
3.3 Concept-wise Masked Denoising
We construct a token lookup table

where the i-th conceptual token [V ] corresponds to a learnable embedding vec-

greater opportunity for convergence into an embedding vector that can more

where τ is the temperature, V is the full set of embedding vectors, and V is

the subset of embedding vectors that correspond to the i-th concept. Eq. (10)
enforces tokens representing the same concept to be closer to each other, induc-
ing these randomly initialized embedding vectors to converge to a shared space
during several warm-up training steps. Afterward, we merge the tokens by com-
puting the mean value of the g embeddings associated with each concept. The
token lookup table is reset to Eq. (7), where the token embeddings are good
initializers to robustly represent the corresponding concepts. In the subsequentConceptExpress 9
training steps, we use the denoising loss described in Eq. (8) to optimize the
merged tokens that represent each concept on a one-to-one basis. We depict the
training process using split-and-merge in Fig. 4.
Attention alignment Althougheachconceptualtokenisoptimizedtorecon-
struct the masked region, there is a lack of direct alignment between the tokens
and individual concepts within a compositional scene. This absence of align-
ment leads to inaccurate cross-attention activation for the learned conceptual
tokens, which hinders the performance of compositional generation. To address
thisproblem,foreachtokeninthelookuptable,wealignitscross-attentionmap
with the mean attention f of the correspondingmaskedregion using a location-
i
aware earth mover’s distance (EMD) regularization. The earth moving cost is
computed as the Euclidean distance between the 2D locations on two attention
maps. Let the cross attention map of the token [V ]j be c ∈ Rh×w, where j

can be omitted after token merging. The regularization loss is formulated as
Lreg =EMD(c ,f ) (11)

which softly guides the cross-attention map to match the desired concept acti-
vations exhibited in the self-attention map.

We train the tokens in two phases for a total of 500 steps, with a learning rate
of 5e-4. In the first 100 steps, we optimize the tokens [V ]j ∈Tsplit using

We use Stable Diffusion v2-1 [54] as our base model. We set α=1e-3, β=1e-5,

In our implementation, self-attention used in concept localization is computed
using the unconditional text prompt ∅ at timestep 0, which induces minimal
textual intervention and maximal denoising of the given image.

4.1 Dataset and Baseline
Dataset In our work, we do not rely on predefined object masks or manually
selected initial words for training images. This allows us to gather high-quality
imagesfromtheInternetwithouthumanannotationstoformourdataset.Specif-
ically, we collect a set D of 961 images from Unsplash2, ensuring that each

provided by [2]. For evaluation, we generate 8 testing images for each training
image using the prompt “a photo of [V ]”.

Baseline To the best of our knowledge, Break-A-Scene [2] is the only work
that is closely related to the problem in this paper. However, Break-A-Scene
operates under a strongly supervised setting, which requires significant prior
knowledgeofthetrainingimage,includingthenumberofconcepts,objectmasks,
andproperlyselectedinitialwords.Toensureafairandmeaningfulcomparison,
weadaptBreak-A-Scenetoourunsupervisedsetting.Specifically,wedisablethe
use of manually picked initial words and instead apply random initialization.
Additionally, we leverage the instance masks identified by our method as the
annotated masks for Break-A-Scene. Finally, we exclusively train the learnable
tokens without fine-tuning the diffusion model. We use this adapted version of
Break-A-Scene, denoted as BaS†, as the baseline method for comparison.
4.2 Evaluation Metric
We establish an evaluation protocol for the UCE problem, which includes two
tailored metrics described as follows.
Concept similarity To quantify how well the model is able to recreate the
concepts accurately, we evaluate the concept similarity, including identity sim-
ilarity (SIMI) and compositional similarity (SIMC). Identity similarity mea-
suresthesimilaritybetweeneachconceptinthetrainingimageandtheconcept-
specific generated images. We employ CLIP [49] and DINO [10] to compute the
similarities. To ensure that the similarity is computed specifically for the i-th
concept,weobtainconcept-wisemaskswithSAM[33]byidentifyingthespecific
SAMmaskassociatedwithourextractedconcept.Specifically,foreachconcept,
we prompt SAM with 3 randomly sampled points on our extracted mask to
produce SAM masks. The training image is then masked with the SAM mask
corresponding to the i-th concept. The metric of identity similarity provides a
crucial criterion for evaluating the intra-concept performance of unsupervised
concept extraction. Compositional similarity measures the CLIP or DINO sim-
ilarity between the source image and the generated image, conditioned on the
prompt “a photo of [V ] and [V ] ... [V ]”. This metric quantifies the degree to
1 2 N
which the source image can be reversed using the extracted concepts.

264 concepts in D and 19 concepts in D . We use these concept features as

4.3 Performance
Quantitative comparison WecompareConceptExpresswithBaS† basedon
conceptsimilarityandclassificationaccuracymetrics.Thequantitativecompar-
ison results on the two datasets are reported in Tabs. 1a and 1b, respectively
with CLIP [49] and DINO [10] as the visual encoder. Notably, ConceptExpress
outperforms BaS† by a significant margin on all evaluation metrics. It achieves
higher concept similarity SIMI and SIMC, indicating a closer alignment with
the source concepts. It also achieves higher classification accuracy ACC1 and
ACC3,indicatingamoresignificantlevelofdisentanglementamongtheindivid-
ually extracted concepts. These results highlight the limitations of the existing
concept extraction approach [2] and establish ConceptExpress as the state-of-
the-art method for the UCE problem.
Qualitative comparison We show several generation samples of Concept-
Express and BaS† in Fig. 5. ConceptExpress presents overall better generation12 S. Hao et al.

fidelity and quality than BaS†. We observe some defects in the generations of
BaS†. For example, in the top left ❸ and the top center ❷, the generation of
BaS† deviates from the source concept. In addition, BaS† fails to preserve the
characteristics of the source concept in the top center ❸ and the bottom left ❶
❷. ConceptExpress effectively overcomes the defects of wrong identity and poor
preservation observed in the generations in BaS†. ConceptExpress consistently
generates high-quality images that precisely align with the source concepts.
4.4 Ablation Study
WeconductaquantitativeablationstudyonthetrainingcomponentsinTab.2.
Effectiveness of split-and-merge strategy (SnM) By comparing Rows
(0)and(1),wevalidatethebenefitofthesplit-and-mergestrategytoinitializer-
absent training. The split-and-merge strategy effectively improves identity sim-
ilarity and classification accuracy while slightly sacrificing compositional sim-
ilarity due to its strong focus on a single concept. In Fig. 6, we present the
generated images at different training steps, which reveals how SnM rectifies
the training direction. The results illustrate that SnM effectively expands the
concept space, allowing learnable tokens to explore a wider range of concepts,
ultimately resulting in a more faithful concept indicator.
Effectiveness of regularization By comparing Rows (0) and (2) in Tab. 2,
we observe that regularizing the attention map can enhance the generation per-
formance of individual concepts. Row (3) is our full method which further im-
proves the performance regarding all metrics compared to incorporating each
component in Rows (1) and (2). The thorough ablation study indicates the ef-
fectiveness of each training component in ConceptExpress.
4.5 Concept Localization Analysis
Self-attention clustering To validate the significance of our three-phase
method for concept localization, we compare it with k-means and our base
method FINCH [58]. Since k-means requires a predefined cluster number and
FINCH requires a stopping point, we set a proper cluster number of 7 for them.

calization performance, we establish a benchmark by (1) building a test dataset
of multi-concept images along with ground-truth concept masks, and (2) devis-
ing tailored metrics for concept localization. The test dataset is sourced from
CLEVR[27],asyntheticdatasetfeaturingcleanbackgroundsandclear,distinct

ates the proportion of true concepts the model can discover, and (3) Precision

details of this evaluation benchmark for concept localization in Appendix B.
Quantitative evaluation Based on the established benchmark, we evaluate
our method compared to k-means and FINCH with various predefined cluster
numbers in Tab. 3. We also report the results of a training-free segmentation
method MaskCut (MC) introduced in CutLER [71] for reference, which per-
forms comparably to our method. When using k-means and FINCH, the prede-

4.6 Unsupervised vs. Supervised
Although ConceptExpress is an unsupervised model, it would be intriguing to
compare ConceptExpress to some supervised methods. Motivated by this, we14 S. Hao et al.

experiment by providing initial words and ground-truth object masks (obtained
by SAM [33]) for the supervised method Break-A-Scene [2]. We compare our
method, BaS†, and three supervised methods by adding different supervision to
Break-A-Scene, as shown in Fig. 8. We can observe that adding initial words
guides the generation towards the specified category, while adding ground-truth
object masks enhances the preservation of texture details. However, even with
these two settings, the generated results of Break-A-Scene still fall short com-
pared to our unsupervised model. Despite being trained in a completely unsu-
pervised manner, our model performs on par with the fully supervised setting,
where both types of supervision are used. This result further highlights the ef-
fectiveness of our model in addressing the concept extraction problem.
4.7 Text-prompted Generation
With the extracted generative concepts, we can perform text-prompted gener-
ation. In Fig. 9, we showcase the results conditioned on various text prompts
using both individual concepts and compositional concepts. The results demon-
strate that the learned conceptual tokens can generate images with high text
fidelity, aligning faithfully with the text prompt. Furthermore, the images gen-
erated with theconceptual tokens also preserve consistent concept identitywith

5 Conclusion
In this paper, we introduce Unsupervised Concept Extraction (UCE) that aims
to leverage diffusion models to learn individual concepts from a single image in
an unsupervised manner. We present ConceptExpress to tackle the UCE prob-
lem by harnessing the capabilities of pretrained diffusion models to locate con-
cepts and learn their corresponding conceptual tokens. Moreover, we establish
an evaluation protocol for the UCE problem. Extensive experiments highlight
ConceptExpress as a promising solution to the UCE task.ConceptExpress 15

A More Details on Implementation
Attention aggregation Theself-attentionmapsindifferentlayershavevary-
ing resolutions. To aggregate them into a single map for further processing, we
follow the approach used in [66]. Each self-attention map A [I,J,:,:] represents
l
the correlation between the location (I,J) and all spatial locations. As a result,
the last two dimensions of the self-attention maps have spatial consistency, and
weinterpolatethemtoensureuniformity.Ontheotherhand,thefirsttwodimen-
sions of the self-attention maps indicate the locations to which attention maps
refer. Therefore, we duplicate these dimensions. By interpolation and duplica-
tion,wealigntheself-attentionmapsinalllayerstoacommonlatentresolution
(i.e., 64×64). Finally, we compute the average of all attention maps to obtain
theaggregatedmap.Thisaggregationstepallowsustocreateaunifiedattention

tions and instead only use the full composition. This decision is made to ensure
that the proportionof using single tokens remains high during training. This, in
turn, facilitates effective learning of each individual conceptual token.

In our problem, the cross-attention map c represents the supply, while the

considers differences not only between elements at the same location but also
between elements at different locations. This means that the EMD takes into
account both spatial alignment and the magnitude of differences, providing a
more comprehensive measure of dissimilarity.2 S. Hao et al.

B Concept Localization Benchmark
In the main paper, we present a novel benchmark to evaluate concept local-
ization performance. This benchmark effectively assesses our model’s concept
localization capability in two aspects: (1) concept discovery accuracy and (2)
concept segmentation efficacy. Here, we offer further details on the benchmark,
including the dataset and evaluation metrics.
Datasetcuration Toassessconceptlocalization,thebenchmarkdatasetmust
meet two criteria: (1) clear and distinct concept definition, and (2) accurate
ground-truth concept masks. Natural images lack these characteristics. Instead,
we source our images from CLEVR [27], a dataset known for its well-defined
objects,diverseincolors,materials,andshapes,setagainstauniformgreyback-
ground. We collect a total of 25 images, each containing 3 to 5 concepts, along
withtheircorrespondingground-truthsegmentationmasks.Weshowimagesam-
ples from the dataset alongside the generated images of our extracted concepts
in Fig. 10 (left).
Evaluationmetrics Wefurtherintroduceevaluationmetricstailoredforcon-
cept localization. The process of concept localization incorporates two parts:
(1) concept discovery and (2) concept segmentation. For these two parts, we
devise three metrics: recall and precision to assess concept discovery, and av-
erageintersectionoverunion(IoU)toassessconceptsegmentation.Specifically,
let P = {m }N denote the set of the N concept segments discovered by the
i i=1
model, and let Q={µ }M denote the set of the M ground-truth concept seg-

where M′ = min(M,N) and Λ(M,M′) denotes the set of all M′-permutations
of integers ranging from 1 to M. Similarly, Λ(N,M′) represents the set of all
M′-permutations of integers ranging from 1 to N. We use Hungarian optimal
assignmentalgorithm[34]tosolvethemaximizationproblemofEq.(18)overthe
set of permutations. The maximum value of the average IoU reflects the overall
segmentation proficiency of our localized concepts. The permutations λ and

λ together give the matching correspondence between ground-truth concepts

and discovered concepts. We further examine the count of true positive concept
matches that yield non-zero IoUs by

C User Study
Toensuretheassessmentofgenerationqualityalignswithhumanpreference,we
conduct a user study comparing the generated results from BaS† and Concept-
Express. We asked 14 users to vote between our method and BaS† by viewing
the generated images of 19 concepts from 7 images in D . For each concept,

we presented the users with 8 images, randomly generated by ConceptExpress
andBaS† respectively,alongwiththemaskedimageofthesourceconcept.They
werethenaskedtoindicatewhichmodelproducedimagesthatbetterresembled
the source concept. Finally, we collected a total of 266 user votes, representing
human preference. Among all the votes, 18.8% of the votes favored BaS† while
81.2% preferred our model. Detailed statistics of the votes for each concept are
present in Fig. 11. The user study further indicates that ConceptExpress out-
performs BaS† in generating concept images that align with human judgment.4 S. Hao et al.

D Additional Ablation Studies
D.1 Self-attention Clustering
In Fig. 12, we present additional self-attention clustering results, comparing our
approach with k-means and FINCH [58]. Upon observation, we note that k-
means and FINCH may separate a single concept (as seen in the 1st, 2nd, and
3rd rows) or include background regions (as seen in the 4th row) within their
clusters. In contrast, our approach consistently demonstrates high accuracy in
locating each concept, ensuring precise concept localization within the image.
D.2 Split-and-merge Strategy

Effect of contrastive loss We further investigate the impact of the con-
trastive loss during the splitting phase. The contrastive loss encourages split
tokens representing the same concept to be closer together, promoting better

Effect of the number of split tokens To observe the impact of the num-
ber of split tokens, i.e., the value of g, on the training process, we evaluate the
performance of our model using different numbers of split tokens. The results
are reported in Tab. 6. From the table, we can make the following observations:
(1)Usingonlyasingletoken(g=1),i.e.,excludingthesplit-and-mergestrategy,
yields poor performance, again demonstrating the significance of the split-and-
mergestrategy;(2)g=3performscomparablytooursetting(g=5),withaslight
improvement in identity similarity and a moderate drop in classification accu-
racy; (3) A larger number (e.g., g=7) may decrease the performance across all
metrics to some extent. In the main paper, we set g=5 to balance all metrics.
This experiment underscores the significance of our split-and-merge strategy for
robust token initialization, which can greatly impact performance.
D.3 Attention Alignment
We compare training with EMD attention alignment (ours) to training with
MSE attention alignment and training without attention alignment, as present
in Fig. 15. From the observation, we can see that when attention alignment is
not used, some concepts in the compositional generated image may be missed.6 S. Hao et al.

On the other hand, using mask MSE can lead to unsatisfactory single-concept
generations. In contrast, our EMD attention alignment strikes a balance be-
tween these two extremes and performs well in both aspects. It ensures that
the model captures and represents all the desired concepts in the compositional
image while also generating high-quality single-concept images. Our attention
alignment approach achieves a favorable trade-off.

E.2 Text Guidance
We also explore the performance of subject-driven text-to-image generation. To
do this, we utilize a set of prompts to generate text-conditioned images with all
extracted concepts and their compositions. We expand the set of prompts used
in [2] from 10 to 15 in Tab. 8. We evaluate the generated images by measuring
theirCLIPimagesimilaritywiththemaskedsourceimage,aswellastheirCLIP

strates significant superiority over BaS† across all evaluation criteria, regardless
of whether the larger or the original classifier is employed.

annotated initializers and (2) model-annotated initializers. For human annota-
tion,wedirectlyassignasuitablewordtoanextractedconceptbasedonhuman

to retrieve a word from CLIP text tokenizer’s vocabulary. This word is selected
based on the highest similarity to the extracted concept, determined by com-
paring features between each word in the vocabulary set and the masked image
part of the concept. We apply these two types of initializers to BaS† and our
model, and compare the experimental results in Tab. 10.
We observe the following: (1) Our model consistently outperforms BaS†, re-
gardless of the type of initializer; (2) Human annotation generally yields better

H Unsatisfactory Cases
In our analysis, we have noticed two limitations of ConceptExpress. The first
limitation is its difficulty in distinguishing instances from the same semantic
category. The second limitation is its struggle to accurately learn concepts for
instanceswitharelativelysmalloccurrence.Wehavediscussedtheselimitations
in Sec. 5 in the main paper.
Tofurtherillustratetheselimitations,weprovideexamplesofunsatisfactory
cases in Fig. 18. The first case arises because similar patches of instances
from the same category (such as bird wings) exhibit close distributions in self-
attentionmaps,leadingtoearlygroupinginthepre-clusteringphase.Asaresult,
we localize the two birds as a single concept, which may affect the number of
instances shown in the generated image. We considered including spatial bias
to address this, but we found it might impede the normal grouping of complete
concepts. Therefore, we opt for our current approach. It is important to note
that this limitation does not significantly impact the overall generation quality.

I Broader Impact
This paper presents a convenient and efficient concept extraction method that
does not require external manual intervention. The extracted concepts can be
used to generate new images. On one hand, this greatly facilitates the effort-
less disentanglement of instances from an image and enables the generation of
personalized images. It even allows for the creation of a vast concept library by
processing a large batch of images, which can be archived for the use of swift
generation.Ontheotherhand,however,thistechnologycanalsobemeticulously
exploitedtohandleandgeneratesensitiveimages,suchasviolent,pornographic,
or privacy-compromising content. Moreover, due to its unsupervised nature, or-
ganizations with massive image datasets can easily perform concept extraction
and build extensive concept libraries, which may include a substantial amount
of harmful or sensitive content. We believe it is crucial to continuously observe
and regulate this technology to ensure its responsible use in the future.
Limitation ConceptExpress has the following limitations that remain to be
addressed in future research. The first limitation is related to processing im-
agescontainingmultipleinstancesfromthesamesemanticcategory,suchastwo
instances of a bird. In this case, self-attention correspondence struggles to dis-
entangle these instances and tends to identify them as a single concept, rather
than recognizing them as separate instances. The second limitation is that cer-
tainconceptswitharelativelysmalloccurrenceintheimagemaybediscovered.
Thiscanresultinpoorconceptlearningduetothelackofsufficientinformation
for reconstructing the concept in the latent space with a resolution of 64×64.
The third limitation is that our model requires a certain level of input image
quality. In the future, it can be further enhanced to robustly handle uncurated
