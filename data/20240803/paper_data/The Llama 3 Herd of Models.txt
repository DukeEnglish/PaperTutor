1 Introduction
Foundation models are general models of language, vision, speech, and/or other modalities that are designed
to support a large variety of AI tasks. They form the basis of many modern AI systems.
The development of modern foundation models consists of two main stages: a pre-training stage in which
(1)
the model is trained at massive scale using straightforward tasks such as next-word prediction or captioning
and a post-training stage in which the model is tuned to follow instructions, align with human preferences,
(2)
and improve specific capabilities (for example, coding and reasoning).
In this paper, we present a new set of foundation models for language, called . The Llama 3 Herd
Llama3
of models natively supports multilinguality, coding, reasoning, and tool usage. Our largest model is dense
Transformer with 405B parameters, processing information in a context window of up to 128K tokens. Each
member of the herd is listed in Table 1. All the results presented in this paper are for the Llama 3.1 models,
which we will refer to as Llama 3 throughout for brevity.
We believe there are three key levers in the development of high-quality foundation models: data, scale, and
managing complexity. We seek to optimize for these three levers in our development process:

to maximize training stability. Similarly, we adopt a relatively simple post-training procedure based
on supervised finetuning (SFT), rejection sampling (RS), and direct preference optimization (DPO;
Rafailov et al. (2023)) as opposed to more complex reinforcement learning algorithms (Ouyang et al.,
2022; Schulman et al., 2017) that tend to be less stable and harder to scale.
The result of our work is Llama 3: a herd of three multilingual1 language models with 8B, 70B, and 405B
parameters. We evaluate the performance of Llama 3 on a plethora of benchmark datasets that span a wide
range of language understanding tasks. In addition, we perform extensive human evaluations that compare
Llama 3 with competing models. An overview of the performance of the flagship Llama 3 model on key
benchmarks is presented in Table 2. Our experimental evaluation suggests that our flagship model performs
on par with leading language models such as GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023a) across a variety of tasks, and is close to
matching the state-of-the-art. Our smaller models are best-in-class, outperforming alternative models with
similar numbers of parameters (Bai et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2023). Llama 3 also delivers a much better
balance between helpfulness and harmlessness than its predecessor (Touvron et al., 2023b). We present a
detailed analysis of the safety of Llama 3 in Section 5.4.

language model and a new version of our Llama Guard model (Inan et al., 2023) for input and output safety.
We hope that the open release of a flagship model will spur a wave of innovation in the research community,
and accelerate a responsible path towards the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI).
As part of the Llama 3 development process we also develop multimodal extensions to the models, enabling
image recognition, video recognition, and speech understanding capabilities. These models are still under
active development and not yet ready for release. In addition to our language modeling results, the paper
presents results of our initial experiments with those multimodal models.

2 GeneralOverview
The model architecture of Llama 3 is illustrated in Figure 1. The development of our Llama 3 language
models comprises two main stages:
• We start by converting a large, multilingual text corpus to discrete tokens
Languagemodelpre-training.
and pre-training a large language model (LLM) on the resulting data to perform next-token prediction.
In the language model pre-training stage, the model learns the structure of language and obtains large
amounts of knowledge about the world from the text it is “reading”. To do this effectively, pre-training
is performed at massive scale: we pre-train a model with 405B parameters on 15.6T tokens using a
context window of 8K tokens. This standard pre-training stage is followed by a continued pre-training
stage that increases the supported context window to 128K tokens. See Section 3 for details.
• The pre-trained language model has a rich understanding of language

but it does not yet follow instructions or behave in the way we would expect an assistant to. We
align the model with human feedback in several rounds, each of which involves supervised finetuning
(SFT) on instruction tuning data and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO; Rafailov et al., 2024).
At this post-training2 stage, we also integrate new capabilities, such as tool-use, and observe strong
improvements in other areas, such as coding and reasoning. See Section 4 for details. Finally, safety
mitigations are also incorporated into the model at the post-training stage, the details of which are
described in Section 5.4.
The resulting models have a rich set of capabilities. They can answer questions in at least eight languages,
write high-quality code, solve complex reasoning problems, and use tools out-of-the-box or in a zero-shot way.
We also perform experiments in which we add image, video, and speech capabilities to Llama 3 using a
compositional approach. The approach we study comprises the three additional stages illustrated in Figure 28:
• We train separate encoders for images and speech. We train our

content and the description of that content in natural language. Our speech encoder is trained using a

self-supervised approach that masks out parts of the speech inputs and tries to reconstruct the masked
out parts via a discrete-token representation. As a result, the model learns the structure of speech
signals. See Section 7 for details on the image encoder and Section 8 for details on the speech encoder.
• We train an adapter that integrates the pre-trained image encoder into the

pre-trained language model. The adapter consists of a series of cross-attention layers that feed image-
encoder representations into the language model. The adapter is trained on text-image pairs. This
aligns the image representations with the language representations. During adapter training, we also
update the parameters of the image encoder but we intentionally do not update the language-model
parameters. We also train a video adapter on top of the image adapter on paired video-text data. This
enables the model to aggregate information across frames. See Section 7 for details.
• Finally, we integrate the speech encoder into the model via an adapter that

converts speech encodings intotoken representations that can be fed directly into the finetuned language
model. The parameters of the adapter and encoder are jointly updated in a supervised finetuning stage
to enable high-quality speech understanding. We do not change the language model during speech
adapter training. We also integrate a text-to-speech system. See Section 8 for details.
Our multimodal experiments lead to models that can recognize the content of images and videos, and support
interaction via a speech interface. These models are still under development and not yet ready for release.
3 Pre-Training
Language model pre-training involves: the curation and filtering of a large-scale training corpus, the

(3)
development of techniques for efficient pre-training at large scale, and the development of a pre-training

recipe. We present each of these components separately below.
3.1 Pre-TrainingData
We create our dataset for language model pre-training from a variety of data sources containing knowledge
until the end of 2023. We apply several de-duplication methods and data cleaning mechanisms on each data
source to obtain high-quality tokens. We remove domains that contain large amounts of personally identifiable
information (PII), and domains with known adult content.
3.1.1 WebDataCuration
Much of the data we utilize is obtained from the web and we describe our cleaning process below.
Among other mitigations, we implement filters designed to remove data from websites

are likely to contain unsafe content or high volumes of PII, domains that have been ranked as harmful
according to a variety of Meta safety standards, and domains that are known to contain adult content.
4We process the raw HTML content for non-truncated web documents to extract

high-quality diverse text. To do so, we build a custom parser that extracts the HTML content and optimizes
for precision in boilerplate removal and content recall. We evaluate our parser’s quality in human evaluations,
comparing it with popular third-party HTML parsers that optimize for article-like content, and found it
to perform favorably. We carefully process HTML pages with mathematics and code content to preserve
the structure of that content. We maintain the image alt attribute text since mathematical content is often
represented as pre-rendered images where the math is also provided in the alt attribute. We experimentally
evaluate different cleaning configurations. We find markdown is harmful to the performance of a model that
is primarily trained on web data compared to plain text, so we remove all markdown markers.
We apply several rounds of de-duplication at the URL, document, and line level:

• We perform global MinHash (Broder, 1997) de-duplication across the

entire dataset to remove near duplicate documents.
• Line-levelde-duplication. We perform aggressive line-level de-duplication similar to ccNet (Wenzek
et al., 2019). We remove lines that appeared more than 6 times in each bucket of 30M documents.
Although our manual qualitative analysis showed that the line-level de-duplication removes not only
leftover boilerplate from various websites such as navigation menus, cookie warnings, but also frequent
high-quality text, our empirical evaluations showed strong improvements.
We develop heuristics to remove additional low-quality documents, outliers, and documents

with excessive repetitions. Some examples of heuristics include:
• We use duplicated n-gram coverage ratio (Rae et al., 2021) to remove lines that consist of repeated
content such as logging or error messages. Those lines could be very long and unique, hence cannot be
filtered by line-dedup.
• We use “dirty word” counting (Raffel et al., 2020) to filter out adult websites that are not covered by
domain block lists.
• We use a token-distribution Kullback-Leibler divergence to filter out documents containing excessive
numbers of outlier tokens compared to the training corpus distribution.
Further, we experiment with applying various model-based quality classifiers
Model-basedqualityfiltering.
to sub-select high-quality tokens. These include using fast classifiers such as fasttext (Joulin et al., 2017)
trained to recognize if a given text would be referenced by Wikipedia (Touvron et al., 2023a), as well as more
compute-intensive Roberta-based classifiers (Liu et al., 2019a) trained on Llama 2 predictions. To train a
quality classifier based on Llama 2, we create a training set of cleaned web documents, describe the quality
requirements, and instruct Llama 2’s chat model to determine if the documents meets these requirements. We
use DistilRoberta (Sanh et al., 2019) to generate quality scores for each document for efficiency reasons. We
experimentally evaluate the efficacy of various quality filtering configurations.
Similar to DeepSeek-AI et al. (2024), we build domain-specific pipelines that extract

code and math-relevant web pages. Specifically, both the code and reasoning classifiers are DistilRoberta
models trained on web data annotated by Llama 2. Unlike the general quality classifier mentioned above, we
conduct prompt tuning to target web pages containing math deduction, reasoning in STEM areas and code
interleaved with natural language. Since the token distribution of code and math is substantially different
than that of natural language, these pipelines implement domain-specific HTML extraction, customized text
features and heuristics for filtering.
Similar to our processing pipelines for English described above, we implement filters to

remove data from websites that are likely to contain PII or unsafe content. Our multilingual text processing
pipeline has several unique features:
• We use a fasttext-based language identification model to categorize documents into 176 languages.
• We perform document-level and line-level de-duplication within data for each language.
5• We apply language-specific heuristics and model-based filters to remove low-quality documents.
Inaddition,weperformqualityrankingofmultilingualdocumentsusingamultilingualLlama2-basedclassifier
to ensure that high-quality content is prioritized. We determine the amount of multilingual tokens used in
pre-training experimentally, balancing model performance on English and multilingual benchmarks.
3.1.2 DeterminingtheDataMix
To obtain a high-quality language model, it is essential to carefully determine the proportion of different data
sources in the pre-training data mix. Our main tools in determining this data mix are knowledge classification
and scaling law experiments.
We develop a classifier to categorize the types of information contained in our web
Knowledgeclassification.
data to more effectively determine a data mix. We use this classifier to downsample data categories that are
over-represented on the web, for example, arts and entertainment.
To determine the best data mix, we perform scaling law experiments in which we
Scalinglawsfordatamix.
train several small models on a data mix and use that to predict the performance of a large model on that mix
(see Section 3.2.1). We repeat this process multiple times for different data mixes to select a new data mix
candidate. Subsequently, we train a larger model on this candidate data mix and evaluate the performance of
that model on several key benchmarks.
Our final data mix contains roughly 50% of tokens corresponding to general knowledge,
Datamixsummary.
25% of mathematical and reasoning tokens, 17% code tokens, and 8% multilingual tokens.
3.1.3 AnnealingData
Empirically,wefindthatannealing(seeSection3.4.3)onsmallamountsofhigh-qualitycodeandmathematical
data can boost the performance of pre-trained models on key benchmarks. Akin to Li et al. (2024b), we
perform annealing with a data mix that upsamples high-quality data in select domains. We do not include
any training sets from commonly used benchmarks in our annealing data. This enables us to assess the true
few-shot learning capabilities and out-of-domain generalization of Llama 3.
Following OpenAI (2023a), we evaluate the efficacy of annealing on the GSM8k (Cobbe et al., 2021) and
MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021b) training sets in annealing. We find that annealing improved the performance
of a pre-trained Llama 3 8B model on the GSM8k and MATH validation sets by 24.0% and 6.4%, respectively.
However, the improvements on the 405B model are negligible, suggesting that our flagship model has strong
in-context learning and reasoning capabilities and does not require specific in-domain training samples to
obtain strong performance.
Similar to Blakeney et al. (2024), we find that annealing enables us to
Usingannealingtoassessdataquality.
judge the value of small domain-specific datasets. We measure the value of such datasets by annealing the
learning rate of a 50% trained Llama 3 8B model linearly to 0 on 40B tokens. In those experiments, we assign
30% weight to the new dataset and the remaining 70% weight to the default data mix. Using annealing to
evaluate new data sources is more efficient than performing scaling law experiments for every small dataset.
3.2 ModelArchitecture
Llama3usesastandard,denseTransformerarchitecture(Vaswanietal.,2017). Itdoesnotdeviatesignificantly
from Llama and Llama 2 (Touvron et al., 2023a,b) in terms of model architecture; our performance gains are
primarily driven by improvements in data quality and diversity as well as by increased training scale.
We make a few small modifications compared to Llama 2:
• Weusegroupedqueryattention(GQA;Ainslieetal.(2023))with8key-valueheadstoimproveinference
speed and to reduce the size of key-value caches during decoding.
• We use an attention mask that prevents self-attention between different documents within the same
sequence. We find that this change had limited impact during in standard pre-training, but find it to be
important in continued pre-training on very long sequences.

• Weuseavocabularywith128Ktokens. Ourtokenvocabularycombines100Ktokensfromthetiktoken3
tokenizer with 28K additional tokens to better support non-English languages. Compared to the Llama
2 tokenizer, our new tokenizer improves compression rates on a sample of English data from 3.17 to
3.94 characters per token. This enables the model to “read” more text for the same amount of training
compute. We also found that adding 28K tokens from select non-English languages improved both
compression ratios and downstream performance, with no impact on English tokenization.
• We increase the RoPE base frequency hyperparameter to 500,000. This enables us to better support
longer contexts; Xiong et al. (2023) showed this value to be effective for context lengths up to 32,768.
Llama 3 405B uses an architecture with 126 layers, a token representation dimension of 16,384, and 128
attention heads; see Table 3 for details. This leads to a model size that is approximately compute-optimal
according to scaling laws on our data for our training budget of 3.8×1025 FLOPs.
3.2.1 ScalingLaws
We develop scaling laws (Hoffmann et al., 2022; Kaplan et al., 2020) to determine the optimal model size for
our flagship model given our pre-training compute budget. In addition to determining the optimal model size,
a major challenge is to forecast the flagship model’s performance on downstream benchmark tasks, due to a
couple of issues: (1) Existing scaling laws typically predict only next-token prediction loss rather than specific
benchmark performance. (2) Scaling laws can be noisy and unreliable because they are developed based on
pre-training runs conducted with small compute budgets (Wei et al., 2022b).
To address these challenges, we implement a two-stage methodology to develop scaling laws that accurately
predict downstream benchmark performance:
1. We first establish a correlation between the compute-optimal model’s negative log-likelihood on down-
stream tasks and the training FLOPs.
2. Next, wecorrelatethenegativelog-likelihoodondownstreamtaskswithtaskaccuracy, utilizingboththe
scaling law models and older models trained with higher compute FLOPs. In this step, we specifically
leverage the Llama 2 family of models.
This approach enables us to predict downstream task performance given a specific number of training FLOPs
for compute-optimal models. We use a similar method to select our pre-training data mix (see Section 3.4).
Concretely, we construct our scaling laws by pre-training models using compute
Scalinglawexperiments.
budgets between 6×1018 FLOPs and 1022 FLOPs. At each compute budget, we pre-train models ranging
in size between 40M and 16B parameters, using a subset of model sizes at each compute budget. In these
training runs, we use a cosine learning rate schedule with a linear warmup for 2,000 training steps. The peak
learning rate is set between 2×10−4 and 4×10−4 depending on the size of the model. We set the cosine
decay to 0.1 of the peak value. The weight decay at each step is set to 0.1 times the learning rate at that step.
We use a fixed batch size for each compute scale, ranging between 250K and 4M.

second degree polynomial. the parabola minimums in Figure 2.
These experiments give rise to the IsoFLOPs curves in Figure 2. The loss in these curves is measured on
a separate validation set. We fit the measured loss values using a second-degree polynomial and identify
the minimums of each parabola. We refer to minimum of a parabola as the compute-optimal model at the
corresponding pre-training compute budget.
We use the compute-optimal models we identified this way to predict the optimal number of training tokens
for a specific compute budget. To do so, we assume a power-law relation between compute budget, C, and
the optimal number of training tokens, N⋆(C):
N⋆(C)=ACα.
We fit A and α using the data from Figure 2. We find that (α,A) = (0.53,0.29); the corresponding fit is
shown in Figure 3. Extrapolation of the resulting scaling law to 3.8×1025 FLOPs suggests training a 402B
parameter model on 16.55T tokens.
An important observation is that IsoFLOPs curves become flatter around the minimum as the compute
budget increases. This implies that performance of the flagship model is relatively robust to small changes in
the trade-off between model size and training tokens. Based on this observation, we ultimately decided to
train a flagship model with 405B parameters.
We use the resulting compute-optimal models to forecast

(normalized) negative log-likelihood of correct answer in the benchmark and the training FLOPs. In this
analysis, weuseonlythe scalinglawmodels trainedupto 1022 FLOPson thedatamixdescribedabove. Next,
we establish a sigmoidal relation between the log-likelihood and accuracy using both the scaling law models
and Llama 2 models, which were trained using the Llama 2 data mix and tokenizer. We show the results of
this experiment on the ARC Challenge benchmark in Figure 4). We find this two-step scaling law prediction,
which extrapolates over four orders of magnitude, to be quite accurate: it only slightly underestimates the
final performance of the flagship Llama 3 model.
3.3 Infrastructure,Scaling,andEfficiency
We describe our hardware and infrastructure that powered Llama 3 405B pre-training at scale and discuss
several optimizations that leads to improvements in training efficiency.

equipped with SSDs, and supports a sustainable throughput of 2 TB/s and a peak throughput of 7 TB/s. A
major challenge is supporting the highly bursty checkpoint writes that saturate the storage fabric for short
durations. Checkpointing saves each GPU’s model state, ranging from 1 MB to 4 GB per GPU, for recovery
and debugging. We aim to minimize GPU pause time during checkpointing and increase checkpoint frequency
to reduce the amount of lost work after a recovery.

trained using Nvidia Quantum2 Infiniband fabric. Both RoCE and Infiniband clusters leverage 400 Gbps
interconnects between GPUs. Despite the underlying network technology differences between these clusters,
we tune both of them to provide equivalent performance for these large training workloads. We elaborate
further on our RoCE network since we fully own its design.

transient congestion and buffering caused by collective communication patterns. This setup helps
limit the impact of persistent congestion and network back pressure caused by slow servers, which is
common in training. Finally, better load balancing through E-ECMP significantly reduces the chance
of congestion. With these optimizations, we successfully run a 24K GPU cluster without traditional
congestion control methods such as Data Center Quantized Congestion Notification (DCQCN).
3.3.2 ParallelismforModelScaling
To scale training for our largest models, we use 4D parallelism—a combination of four different types of
parallelism methods—to shard the model. This approach efficiently distributes computation across many
GPUs and ensures each GPU’s model parameters, optimizer states, gradients, and activations fit in its
HBM. Our implementation of 4D parallelism is illustrated in Figure 5. It combines tensor parallelism (TP;
Krizhevsky et al. (2012); Shoeybi et al. (2019); Korthikanti et al. (2023)), pipeline parallelism (PP; Huang
et al. (2019); Narayanan et al. (2021); Lamy-Poirier (2023)), context parallelism (CP; Liu et al. (2023a)), and
data parallelism (DP; Rajbhandari et al. (2020); Ren et al. (2021); Zhao et al. (2023b)).
Tensorparallelismsplitsindividualweighttensorsintomultiplechunksondifferentdevices. Pipelineparallelism
partitions the model vertically into stages by layers, so that different devices can process in parallel different
stagesofthefullmodelpipeline. Contextparallelismdividestheinputcontextintosegments,reducingmemory
bottleneck for very long sequence length inputs. We use fully sharded data parallelism (FSDP; Rajbhandari
et al., 2020; Ren et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2023b), which shards the model, optimizer, and gradients while
implementing data parallelism which processes data in parallel on multiple GPUs and synchronizes after each
training step. Our use of FSDP for Llama 3 shards optimizer states and gradients, but for model shards we do
not reshard after forward computation to avoid an extra all-gather communication during backward passes.
Through careful tuning of the parallelism configuration, hardware, and software, we achieve
GPUutilization.
an overall BF16 Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU; Chowdhery et al. (2023)) of 38-43% for the configurations
shown in Table 4. The slight drop in MFU to 41% on 16K GPUs with DP=128 compared to 43% on 8K
GPUs with DP=64 is due to the lower batch size per DP group needed to keep the global tokens per batch
constant during training.
We encountered several challenges with existing implementations:
Pipelineparallelismimprovements.
• Current implementations have constraints on supported batch size per GPU,

requiring it to be divisible by the number of pipeline stages. For the example in Figure 6, the depth-first
schedule (DFS) of pipeline parallelism (Narayanan et al., 2021) requires N = PP = 4, while the
breadth-first schedule (BFS; Lamy-Poirier (2023)) requires N = M, where M is the total number
of micro-batches and N is the number of contiguous micro-batches for the same stage’s forward or
backward. However, pre-training often needs flexibility to adjust batch size.

10GPUs are divided into parallelism groups in the order of [TP, CP, PP, DP], where
Figure5 Illustrationof4Dparallelism.
DP stands for FSDP. In this example, 16 GPUs are configured with a group size of |TP|=2, |CP|=2, |PP|=2, and
|DP|=2. A GPU’s position in 4D parallelism is represented as a vector, [D , D , D , D ], where D is the index on
1 2 3 4 i
the i-th parallelism dimension. In this example, GPU0[TP0, CP0, PP0, DP0] and GPU1[TP1, CP0, PP0, DP0] are in
the same TP group, GPU0 and GPU2 are in the same CP group, GPU0 and GPU4 are in the same PP group, and
GPU0 and GPU8 are in the same DP group.
To address these issues, we modify our pipeline schedule as shown in Figure 6, which allows setting N
flexibly—in this case N =5, which can run a arbitrary number of micro-batches in each batch. This allows
us to run: (1) fewer micro-batches than the number of stages when we have batch size limit at large scale;
or (2) more micro-batches to hide point-to-point communication, finding a sweet spot between DFS and
breadth first schedule (BFS) for the best communication and memory efficiency. To balance the pipeline,
we reduce one Transformer layer each from the first and the last stages, respectively. This means that
the first model chunk on the first stage has only the embedding, and the last model chunk on the last
stage has only output projection and loss calculation. To reduce pipeline bubbles, we use an interleaved
schedule (Narayanan et al., 2021) with V pipeline stages on one pipeline rank. Overall pipeline bubble ratio
is PP−1. Further, we adopt asynchronous point-to-point communication in PP, which considerably speeds up
V∗M
training, especially in cases when the document mask introduces extra computation imbalance. We enable
TORCH_NCCL_AVOID_RECORD_STREAMS to reduce memory usage from asynchronous point-to-point
communication. Finally, to reduce memory cost, based on detailed memory allocation profiling, we proactively
deallocate tensors that will not be used for future computation, including the input and output tensors of each
pipeline stage, that will not be used for future computation. With these optimizations, we could pre-train
Llama 3 on sequences of 8K tokens without activation checkpointing.
We utilize context parallelism (CP) to improve memory efficiency when

scaling the context length of Llama 3 and enable training on extremely long sequences up to 128K in length.
In CP, we partition across the sequence dimension, and specifically we partition the input sequence into
2×CP chunks so each CP rank receives two chunks for better load balancing. The i-th CP rank received
both the i-th and the (2×CP−1−i)-th chunks.
Different from existing CP implementations that overlap communication and computation in a ring-like
structure (Liu et al., 2023a), our CP implementation adopts an all-gather based method where we first
all-gather the key (K) and value (V) tensors, and then compute attention output for the local query (Q)
tensor chunk. Although the all-gather communication latency is exposed in the critical path, we still adopt
this approach for two main reasons: (1) it is easier and more flexible to support different types of attention
masks in all-gather based CP attention, such as the document mask; and (2) the exposed all-gather latency

four pipeline ranks (PP ranks 0 to 3), where the GPUs with rank 0 run stages 0 and 4, the GPUs with P rank 1 run
stages 1 and 5, etc. The colored blocks (0 to 9) represent a sequence of micro-batches, where M is the total number of
micro-batches and N is the number of continuous micro-batches for the same stage’s forward or backward. Our key
insight is to make N tunable.
is small as the communicated K and V tensors are much smaller than Q tensor due to the use of GQA (Ainslie
et al., 2023). Hence, the time complexity of attention computation is an order of magnitude larger than
all-gather (O(S2) versus O(S), where S represents the sequence length in the full causal mask), making the
all-gather overhead negligible.
The order of parallelism dimensions, [TP, CP, PP, DP], is optimized

for network communication. The innermost parallelism requires the highest network bandwidth and lowest
latency, and hence is usually constrained to within the same server. The outermost parallelism may spread
across a multi-hop network and should tolerate higher network latency. Therefore, based on the requirements
for network bandwidth and latency, we place parallelism dimensions in the order of [TP, CP, PP, DP]. DP
(i.e., FSDP) is the outermost parallelism because it can tolerate longer network latency by asynchronously
prefetching sharded model weights and reducing gradients. Identifying the optimal parallelism configuration
with minimal communication overhead while avoiding GPU memory overflow is challenging. We develop a
memory consumption estimator and a performance-projection tool which helped us explore various parallelism
configurations and project overall training performance and identify memory gaps effectively.
By comparing training loss between different parallelism setups, we fixed several numerical

issues that impact training stability. To ensure training convergence, we use FP32 gradient accumulation
during backward computation over multiple micro-batches and also reduce-scatter gradients in FP32 across
data parallel workers in FSDP. For intermediate tensors, e.g., vision encoder outputs, that are used multiple
times in the forward computation, the backward gradients are also accumulated in FP32.
3.3.3 CollectiveCommunication
Our collective communication library for Llama 3 is based on a fork of Nvidia’s NCCL library, called NCCLX.
NCCLX significantly improves the performance of NCCL, especially for higher latency networks. Recall that
the order of parallelism dimensions is [TP, CP, PP, DP], where DP corresponds to FSDP. The outermost
parallelism dimensions, PP and DP, may communicate through a multi-hop network, with latency up to tens
of microseconds. The original NCCL collectives—all-gather and reduce-scatter in FSDP, and point-to-point
in PP—require data chunking and staged data copy. This approach incurs several inefficiencies, including
(1) requiring a large number of small control messages to be exchanged over the network to facilitate data
transfer, (2) extra memory-copy operations, and (3) using extra GPU cycles for communication. For Llama 3
training, we address a subset of these inefficiencies by tuning chunking and data transfer to fit our network
latencies,whichcanbeashighastensofmicrosecondsforalargecluster. Wealsoallowsmallcontrolmessages
to traverse our network at a higher priority, especially avoiding being head-of-line blocked in deep-buffer
core switches. Our ongoing work for future Llama versions involves making deeper changes in NCCLX to
holistically address all the aforementioned problems.

that we have operated. Moreover, the synchronous nature of training makes it less fault-tolerant—a single
GPU failure may require a restart of the entire job. Despite these challenges, for Llama 3, we achieved higher
than 90% effective training time while supporting automated cluster maintenance, such as firmware and Linux
kernel upgrades (Vigraham and Leonhardi, 2024), which resulted in at least one training interruption daily.
The effective training time measures the time spent on useful training over the elapsed time.
During a 54-day snapshot period of pre-training, we experienced a total of 466 job interruptions. Of these, 47
were planned interruptions due to automated maintenance operations such as firmware upgrades or operator-
initiated operations like configuration or dataset updates. The remaining 419 were unexpected interruptions,

for 58.7% of all unexpected issues. Despite the large number of failures, significant manual intervention was
required only three times during this period, with the rest of issues handled by automation.
To increase the effective training time, we reduced job startup and checkpointing time, and developed tools
for fast diagnosis and problem resolution. We extensively use PyTorch’s built-in NCCL flight recorder (Ansel
etal.,2024), afeaturethatcapturescollectivemetadataandstacktracesintoaringbuffer, andhenceallowing
us to diagnose hangs and performance issues quickly at scale, particularly with regard to NCCLX. Using
this, we efficiently record every communication event and the duration of each collective operation, and also

intensive tracing operations and metadata collection selectively as needed live in production through online
configuration changes (Tang et al., 2015) without needing a code release or job restart.
Debugging issues in large-scale training is complicated by the mixed use of NVLink and RoCE in our network.
Data transfer over NVLink typically occurs through load/store operations issued by CUDA kernels, and

such a stall is detected. Additionally, NCCLX traces the kernel and network activities of each NCCLX
communication and provides a snapshot of the failing NCCLX collective’s internal state, including finished
and pending data transfers between all ranks. We analyze this data to debug NCCLX scaling issues.
Sometimes,hardwareissuesmaycausestill-functioningbutslowstragglersthatarehardtodetect. Evenasingle
straggler can slow down thousands of other GPUs, often appearing as functioning but slow communications.
We developed tools to prioritize potentially problematic communications from selected process groups. By
investigating just a few top suspects, we were usually able to effectively identify the stragglers.
One interesting observation is the impact of environmental factors on training performance at scale. For
Llama 3 405B , we noted a diurnal 1-2% throughput variation based on time-of-day. This fluctuation is the
result of higher mid-day temperatures impacting GPU dynamic voltage and frequency scaling.
During training, tens of thousands of GPUs may increase or decrease power consumption at the same time,
for example, due to all GPUs waiting for checkpointing or collective communications to finish, or the startup
or shutdown of the entire training job. When this happens, it can result in instant fluctuations of power
consumption across the data center on the order of tens of megawatts, stretching the limits of the power grid.
This is an ongoing challenge for us as we scale training for future, even larger Llama models.

pre-train the 8B and 70B models.
3.4.1 InitialPre-Training
We pre-train Llama 3 405B using AdamW with a peak learning rate of 8×10−5, a linear warm up of 8,000
steps, and a cosine learning rate schedule decaying to 8×10−7over 1,200,000 steps. We use a lower batch size
early in training to improve training stability, and increase it subsequently to improve efficiency. Specifically,
we use an initial batch size of 4M tokens and sequences of length 4,096, and double these values to a batch
size of 8M sequences of 8,192 tokens after pre-training 252M tokens. We double the batch size again to 16M
after pre-training on 2.87T tokens. We found this training recipe to be very stable: we observed few loss
spikes and did not require interventions to correct for model training divergence.

window. This long-context pre-training stage was performed using approximately 800B training tokens.

supervised finetuning, and direct preference optimization. See text for details.
3.4.3 Annealing
During pre-training on the final 40M tokens, we linearly annealed the learning rate to 0, maintaining a context
length of 128K tokens. During this annealing phase, we also adjusted the data mix to upsample data sources
of very high quality; see Section 3.1.3. Finally, we compute the average of model checkpoints (Polyak (1991)
averaging) during annealing to produce the final pre-trained model.
4 Post-Training
We produce the aligned Llama 3 models by applying several rounds of post-training,6 or aligning the model
with human feedback (Ouyang et al., 2022; Rafailov et al., 2024) on top of a pre-trained checkpoint. Each
round of post-training involves supervised finetuning (SFT) followed by Direct Preference Optimization (DPO;
Rafailov et al., 2024) on examples collected either via human annotations or generated synthetically. Our
post-training modeling and data approaches are described in Sections 4.1 and 4.2 respectively. We further
detail custom data curation strategies to improve the reasoning, coding, factuality, multilingual, tool use, long
context, and precise instruction following in Section 4.3.
4.1 Modeling
The backbone of our post-training strategy is a reward model and a language model. We first train a reward
model on top of the pre-trained checkpoint using human-annotated preference data (see Section 4.1.2). We
then finetune pre-trained checkpoints with supervised finetuning (SFT; see Section 4.1.3), and further align
the checkpoints with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO; see Section 4.1.4). This process is illustrated
in Figure 7. Unless otherwise noted, our modeling procedure applies to Llama 3 405B, and we refer to
Llama 3 405B as Llama 3 for simplicity.
4.1.1 ChatDialogFormat
To tune LLMs for human-AI interaction, we need to define a chat dialog protocol for the model to understand
human instructions and perform conversational tasks. Compared to its predecessor, Llama 3 has new
capabilities such as tool use (Section 4.3.5) which may require generating multiple messages and sending
6Weusetheterm“post-training” torefertoanymodeltrainingthathappensoutsideofpre-training.
15them to different locations (e.g., user, ipython) within a single dialog turn. To support this, we design a new
multi-message chat protocol which uses various special header and termination tokens. The header tokens
are used to indicate the source and destination of each message in a conversation. Similarly, the termination
tokens indicate when it is the time to alternate between human and AI to speak.
4.1.2 RewardModeling
We train a reward model (RM) covering different capabilities on top of the pre-trained checkpoint. The
training objective is the same as Llama 2 except that we remove the margin term in the loss, as we observe
diminishing improvements after data scaling. Following Llama 2, we use all of our preference data for reward
modeling after filtering out samples with similar responses. In addition to standard preference pair of (chosen,
rejected) response, annotations also create a third “edited response” for some prompts, where the chosen
response from the pair is further edited for improvement (see Section 4.2.1). Hence, each preference ranking
sample has two or three responses with clear ranking (edited > chosen > rejected). We concatenate the
prompt and multiple responses into a single row during training with responses randomly shuffled. This is an
approximation to the standard scenario of putting the responses in separate rows and computing the scores,
but in our ablations, this approach improves training efficiency without a loss in accuracy.
4.1.3 SupervisedFinetuning
The reward model is then used to perform rejection sampling on our human annotation prompts, the details
of which are described in Section 4.2. Together with this rejection-sampled data and other data sources
(including synthetic data), we finetune the pre-trained language model using a standard cross entropy loss
on the target tokens (while masking loss on prompt tokens). More details about the data mix can be found
in Section 4.2. We refer to this stage as supervised finetuning (SFT; Wei et al., 2022a; Sanh et al., 2022;
Wang et al., 2022b), even though many of the training targets are model-generated. Our largest models are
finetuned with a learning rate of 10−5 over the course of 8.5K to 9K steps. We found these hyperparameter
settings to work well across different rounds and data mixes.
4.1.4 DirectPreferenceOptimization
We further train our SFT models with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO; Rafailov et al., 2024) for human
preference alignment. For training, we primarily use the most recent batches of preference data collected using
thebestperformingmodelsfromthepreviousalignmentrounds. Asaresult,ourtrainingdataconformsbetter
to the distribution of the policy model that is being optimized in each round. We also explored on-policy
algorithms such as PPO (Schulman et al., 2017), but found that DPO required less compute for large-scale
models and performed better, especially on instruction following benchmarks like IFEval (Zhou et al., 2023).
For Llama 3, we use a learning rate of 10−5 and set the β hyper-parameter to be 0.1. In addition, we apply
the following algorithmic modifications to DPO:
• : We mask out special formatting tokens including header
MaskingoutformattingtokensinDPOloss
and termination tokens (described in Section 4.1.1) from both chosen and rejected responses in the
loss to stabilize DPO training. We observe that having these tokens contribute to the loss may lead
to undesired model behaviors such as tail repetition or abruptly generating termination tokens. We
hypothesize that this is due to the contrastive nature of the DPO loss – the presence of common tokens
in both chosen and rejected responses leads to a conflicting learning objective as the model needs to
increase and reduce the likelihood of these tokens simultaneously.
• : Weaddanadditionalnegativelog-likelihood(NLL)losstermwithascaling

coefficient of 0.2 on the chosen sequences, similar to Pang et al. (2024). This helps further stabilize DPO
training by maintaining desired formatting for generation and preventing the decrease of log probability
of chosen responses (Pang et al., 2024; Pal et al., 2024).
4.1.5 ModelAveraging
Finally, we average models obtained from experiments using various versions of data or hyperparameters at
each RM, SFT, or DPO stage (Izmailov et al., 2019; Wortsman et al., 2022; Li et al., 2022).

responses at each turn. In post-processing, we split each dialogue to multiple examples at a turn level. Each example
consists of a prompt (including previous dialog if available) and a response (e.g., chosen or rejected response).
4.1.6 IterativeRounds
Following Llama 2, we apply the above methods in six rounds. In each cycle, we collect new preference
annotations and SFT data, sampling synthetic data from the latest models.
4.2 Post-trainingData
The post-training data composition plays a critical role in the usefulness and behavior of language models. In
this section, we discuss our human annotation procedures and preference data collection (Section 4.2.1), the
compositionofourSFTdata(Section4.2.2),andmethodsfordataqualitycontrolandcleaning(Section4.2.3).
4.2.1 PreferenceData
Our preference data annotation process is similar to Llama 2. We deploy multiple models for annotation after
each round and sample two responses from two different models for each user prompt. These models can
be trained with different data mixes and alignment recipes, allowing for different capability strength (e.g.,
code expertise) and increased data diversity. We ask annotators to rate the strength of their preference by
categorizing it into one of four levels, based on how much more they prefer the chosen response over the
rejected one: significantly better, better, slightly better, or marginally better. We also incorporate an editing
step after preference ranking to encourage annotators to further improve the preferred response. Annotators
edit the chosen response directly or prompt the model with feedback to refine its own response. Consequently,
a portion of our preference data has three responses ranked (edited > chosen > rejected).
InTable6,wereportthestatisticsofpreferenceannotationsthatweuseforLlama3training. GeneralEnglish
covers multiple subcategories such as knowledge-based question and answering or precise instruction-following,
which fall outside the scope of specific capabilities. Compared to Llama 2, we observe an increase in the
average length of prompt and response, suggesting that we train Llama 3 on more complex tasks. In addition,
we implement a quality analysis and human evaluation process to rigorously assess the data collected, allowing
us to refine our prompts and provide systematic, actionable feedback to annotators. For example, as Llama 3
improves after each round, we increase prompt complexity accordingly to target areas where the model lags.
In each round of post-training, we use all the preference data that is available at the time for reward modeling,
while only using the latest batches from various capabilities for DPO training. For both reward modeling and
DPO, we use samples that are labeled as the chosen response being significantly better or better than the
rejected counterpart for training and discard samples with similar responses.
4.2.2 SFTData
Our finetuning data is largely comprised of the following sources:
• Prompts from our human annotation collection with rejection-sampled responses.
• Synthetic data targeting specific capabilities (see Section 4.3 for more details).

consists of a context (i.e., all conversation turns except the last one) and a final response.
• Small amounts of human-curated data (see Section 4.3 for more details).
As our post-training rounds progress, we develop stronger Llama 3 variants that we use to collect larger
datasets that cover a wide range of complex capabilities. In this section, we discuss the details for the
rejection-sampling procedure and overall composition of our final SFT datamix.
During rejection sampling (RS), for each prompt collected during human annotation
Rejectionsampling.
(Section 4.2.1) we sample K (typically between 10 and 30) outputs from the latest chat model policy (usually
the best performing checkpoint from the previous post-training iteration, or the best performing checkpoint
for a particular capability) and use our reward model to select the best candidate, consistent with Bai et al.
(2022). In later rounds of post-training, we introduce system prompts to steer RS responses to conform with
desirable tone, style, or formatting, which might be different for different capabilities.
To increase the efficiency of rejection sampling, we adopt PagedAttention (Kwon et al., 2023). PagedAttention
enhances memory efficiency through dynamic key-value cache allocation. It supports arbitrary output lengths
by dynamically scheduling requests based on the current cache capacity. Unfortunately, this carries the risk of
swap-out when running out of memory. To eliminate such swap overhead, we define a maximum output length
and perform a request only if sufficient memory is available to fit an output with that length. PagedAttention
also enables us to share the key-value cache pages for a prompt across all corresponding outputs. Together,
this leads to a throughput improvement of over 2× during rejection sampling.
Table 7 shows data statistics for each broad category of our “helpfulness” mix. While
Overalldatacomposition.
SFT and preference data contain overlapping domains, they are curated differently, yielding distinct count
statistics. In Section 4.2.3 we describe techniques for categorizing topic, complexity, and quality of our data
samples. In each round of post-training, we adjust our overall data mix carefully across these axes to tune
performance across a wide range of benchmarks. Our final data mix epochs multiple times on some high
quality sources and downsamples others.
4.2.3 DataProcessingandQualityControl
Given that most of our training data is model-generated, it requires careful cleaning and quality control.
In the early rounds, we observed a number of undesirable patterns common in our data, such

as excessive use of emojis or exclamation points. Therefore, we implement a series of rule-based data removal
and modification strategies to filter or clean problematic data. For example, to mitigate overly-apologetic
tonal issues, we identify overused phrases (such as “I’m sorry” or “I apologize”) and carefully balance the
proportion of such samples in our dataset.
We also apply a collection of model-based techniques to remove low-quality training samples

and improve overall model performance:
• We first finetune Llama 3 8B into a topic classifier, and perform inference over

18buckets (“geometry and trigonometry”).
• We use both reward model and Llama-based signals to obtain a quality score for each

sample. ForanRM-basedscore, weconsiderdatathatisinthetopquartileofRMscoresashighquality.
For a Llama-based score, we prompt Llama 3 checkpoint to rate each sample on a three-point scale for
general English data (accuracy, instruction following, and tone/presentation) and a two-point scale for
coding data (bug identification and user intention), and consider samples that obtain the maximum
score as high quality. The RM and Llama-based scores have high disagreement rates, and we find that
combining these signals yield the best recall on our internal test set. Ultimately, we select examples
that are marked as high quality by the RM or the Llama-based filter.
• Because we are also interested in prioritizing examples that are more complex for
Difficultyscoring:
the model, we score data using two measures of difficulty: Instag (Lu et al., 2023) and Llama-based
scoring. For Instag, we prompt Llama 3 70B to perform intention tagging of SFT prompts, where more
intentions implies more complexity. We also prompt Llama 3 to measure the difficulty (Liu et al., 2024c)
of dialogs on a three-point scale.
• Finally, we perform semantic deduplication (Abbas et al., 2023; Liu et al.,
Semanticdeduplication:
2024c). We first cluster complete dialogs using RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019b) and within each cluster
sort them by quality score × difficulty score. We then do greedy selection by iterating through all sorted
examples, and only keeping the ones that have maximum cosine similarity less than a threshold to the
examples seen so far in the cluster.
4.3 Capabilities
We highlight special efforts to improve performance for specific capabilities such as code (Section 4.3.1),
multilinguality (Section 4.3.2), math and reasoning (Section 4.3.3), long context (Section 4.3.4), tool use
(Section 4.3.5), factuality (Section 4.3.6), and steerability (Section 4.3.7).
4.3.1 Code
LLMs for code have received significant attention since the release of Copilot and Codex (Chen et al., 2021).
Developers are now widely using these models to generate code snippets, debug, automate tasks, and improve
code quality. For Llama 3, we target improving and evaluating code generation, documentation, debugging,
and review capabilities for the following high priority programming languages: Python, Java, Javascript,
C/C++, Typescript, Rust, PHP, HTML/CSS, SQL, bash/shell. Here, we present our work on improving
these coding capabilities via training a code expert, generating synthetic data for SFT, improving formatting
with system prompt steering, and creating quality filters to remove bad samples from our training data.
We train a which we use to collect high quality human annotations for code

specific data has been shown to be effective for improving performance in a specific domain (Gururangan
et al., 2020). We follow a recipe similar to that of CodeLlama (Rozière et al., 2023). For the last several
thousand steps of training we perform long-context finetuning (LCFT) to extend the expert’s context length
to 16K tokens on a high quality mix of repo-level code data. Finally, we follow the similar post-training
modeling recipes described in Section 4.1 to align this model, except with SFT and DPO data mixes primarily
targeting code. This model is also used for rejection sampling (Section 4.2.2) for coding prompts.
During development, we identified key issues in code generation, including difficulty

in following instructions, code syntax errors, incorrect code generation, and difficulty in fixing bugs. While
intensive human annotation could theoretically resolve these issues, synthetic data generation offers a
complementary approach at a lower cost and higher scale, unconstrained by the expertise level of annotators.
As such, we use Llama 3 and the code expert to generate a large quantity of synthetic SFT dialogs.
We describe three high-level approaches for generating synthetic code data. In total, we generate over 2.7M
synthetic examples which were used during SFT.

improvements when trained on data generated by a larger, more competent model. However, our initial
experiments revealed that training Llama 3 405B on its own generated data is not helpful (and can
even degrade performance). To address this limitation, we introduced execution feedback as a source of
truth, enabling the model to learn from its mistakes and stay on track. In particular, we generate large
dataset of approximately one million synthetic coding dialogues using the following process:
• First, we generate a large collection of programming problem
Problemdescriptiongeneration:
descriptions that span a diverse range of topics, including those in the long tail distribution. To
achieve this diversity, we sample random code snippets from various sources and prompt the model
to generate programming problems inspired by these examples. This allowed us to tap into a wide
range of topics and create a comprehensive set of problem descriptions (Wei et al., 2024).
• Then, we prompt Llama 3 to solve each problem in a given programming

language. We observe that adding general rules of good programming to the prompt improves the
generated solution quality. Also, we find it is helpful to require the model to explain its thought

• After generating a solution, it is crucial to recognize that its correctness is

not guaranteed, and including incorrect solutions in the finetuning dataset could harm the model’s
quality. While we do not ensure complete correctness, we develop methods to approximate it. To
achieve this, we extract the source code from the generated solution and applied a combination of
static and dynamic analysis techniques to test its correctness, including:
– Staticanalysis: We run all generated code through a parser and a linter to ensure syntactic
correctness,catchingerrorssuchassyntaxerrors,useofuninitializedvariablesornon-imported
functions, code style issues, typing errors, and others.
– Unittestgenerationandexecution: For each problem and solution, we prompt the model
to generate unit tests, executed in a containerized environment together with the solution,
catching run-time execution errors and some semantic errors.
• When a solution fails at any step, we prompt the

model to revise it. The prompt included the original problem description, the faulty solution,
and feedback from the parser/linter/tester (stdout, stderr/ and return code). After a unit test

dataset, used for supervised finetuning (SFT). Notably, we observed that about 20% of solutions
were initially incorrect but self-corrected, indicating that the model learned from the execution

• The finetuning process is conducted over multiple rounds,

with each round building on the previous one. After each round, the model is improved, generating
higher-quality synthetic data for the next round. This iterative process allows for progressive
refinement and enhancement of the model’s performance.
2. We observe a performance gap between

major programming languages (e.g., Python/C++) and less common ones (e.g., Typescript/PHP). This
is not surprising as we have less training data for less common programming languages. To mitigate
this, we supplement our existing data by translating data from common programming languages to
less common languages (similar to Chen et al. (2023) in the context of reasoning). This is achieved
by prompting Llama 3 and ensuring quality via syntax parsing, compilation, and execution. Figure 8
demonstrates an example of synthetic PHP code translated from Python. This improves performance

alternative multi-step approach. Using this procedure, we generated approximately 1.2M synthetic

• We then prompt the model to “backtranslate” the synthetically generated data to

system prompts to improve code readability, documentation, thoroughness, and specificity. Recall, from
Section 7 this data is used to finetune the language model. Figure 9 shows an example of how the system

variable names, saves memory, etc.
As described in Section 4.2.3, we occasionally

encounter quality issues in our rejection-sampled data, such as code blocks containing bugs. Detecting these
issues in our rejection-sampled data is not as straightforward as it is for our synthetic code data, as the
rejection-sampled responses typically contain a mix of natural language and code for which the code may not

onlyaverysmallsnippetofanexecutableprogram.) Toaddressthis,weutilizethe“model-as-judge” approach,
where earlier versions of Llama 3 assess and assign a binary (0/1) score based on two criteria: code correctness
and code style. We retain only those samples that achieve a perfect score of 2. Initially, this stringent filtering
led to a regression in downstream benchmark performance, primarily because it disproportionately removed
examples with challenging prompts. To counteract this, we strategically revise the responses of some coding
data categorized as most challenging until they met the Llama-based “model-as-judge” criteria. By refining
these challenging problems, the coding data achieves a balance between quality and difficulty, resulting in
optimal downstream performance.
4.3.2 Multilinguality
We describe how we improve Llama 3’s multilingual capabilities, including training an expert specialized on
substantially more multilingual data, sourcing and generating high quality multilingual instruction tuning
data for German, French, Italian, Portuguese, Hindi, Spanish, and Thai, and tackling specific challenges of
multilingual language steering to enhance the overall performance of our model.

branching off the pre-training run and continuing to pre-train on a data mix that consists of 90% multilingual
tokens. We then perform post-training on this expert following Section 4.1. This expert model is then used to
collect higher quality annotations in non-English languages until pre-training was fully complete.
Our multilingual SFT data is derived primarily from sources described below. The

and rewrite into dialog format. For example, we use data from exams-qa (Hardalov et al., 2020)
and Conic10k (Wu et al., 2023). To improve language alignment, we also use parallel texts from
GlobalVoices (Prokopidis et al., 2016) and Wikimedia (Tiedemann, 2012). We use LID based filtering
and Blaser2.0 (Seamless Communication et al., 2023) to remove low quality data. For parallel text data,

to better simulate real-life conversations in translation and language learning scenarios.

high-quality samples for finetuning, with few modifications compared to the process for English data:
– Generation: We explored randomly choosing the temperature hyperparameter from the range
0.2−1 for diverse generations in early rounds of post-training. With high temperature, responses
for multilingual prompts can get creative and inspiring, but are also susceptible to unnecessary
or unnatural code-switching. In the final round of post-training, we use a constant value of 0.6
to balance the trade-off. Additionally, we used specialized system prompts to improve response
format, structure and general readability.
– Selection: Prior to reward model based selection, we implement multilingual-specific checks to
ensurehighlanguage-matchratebetweenthepromptandresponse(e.g.,aromanizedHindiprompt
should not expect a response in Hindi Devanagari script).
• : We try to avoid using machine-translated data to finetune the model in order to

prevent translationese (Bizzoni et al., 2020; Muennighoff et al., 2023) or possible name bias (Wang
et al., 2022a), gender bias (Savoldi et al., 2021), or cultural bias (Ji et al., 2023). Moreover, we aim to
prevent the model from being exposed only to tasks that are rooted in English cultural context, which
may not be representative of the linguistic and cultural diversity we aim to capture. We made one
exception to this and translated our synthetic quantitative reasoning data (see Section 4.3.3 for details)
to improve performance in quantitative reasoning in non-English languages. Due to the simple nature of
22the language in these math problems, the translated samples were found to have little to no quality
issues. We observed strong gains on MGSM (Shi et al., 2022) from adding this translated data.
4.3.3 MathandReasoning
We define reasoning as the ability to perform multi-step computations and arrive at the correct final answer.
Several challenges guide our approach to training models that excel in mathematical reasoning:
• : As the complexity of questions increases, the number of valid prompts or questions
Lackofprompts
for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) decreases. This scarcity makes it difficult to create diverse and
representative training datasets for teaching models various mathematical skills (Yu et al., 2023; Yue
et al., 2023; Luo et al., 2023; Mitra et al., 2024; Shao et al., 2024; Yue et al., 2024b).
• : Effective reasoning requires a step-by-step solution to facilitate
Lackofgroundtruthchainofthought
the reasoning process (Wei et al., 2022c). However, there is often a shortage of ground truth chains of
thought, which are essential for guiding the model how to break down the problem step-by-step and
reach the final answer (Zelikman et al., 2022).
• : When using model-generated chains of thought, the intermediate steps
Incorrectintermediatesteps
may not always be correct (Cobbe et al., 2021; Uesato et al., 2022; Lightman et al., 2023; Wang et al.,
2023a). This inaccuracy can lead to incorrect final answers and needs to be addressed.
• : Enhancingmodelstoutilizeexternaltools,suchascodeinterpreters,

allows them to reason by interleaving code and text (Gao et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2022; Gou et al.,

• : There is often a discrepancy between how the model is

interact with humans or other models, requiring it to improve its reasoning using feedback. Ensuring
consistency between training and real-world usage is crucial for maintaining reasoning performance.
To address these challenges, we apply the following methodologies:
• We source relevant pre-training data from mathematical contexts and
Addressingthelackofprompts:
converteditintoaquestion-answerformatwhichcanthenbeusedforsupervisedfinetuning. Additionally,
we identify mathematical skills where the model under-performs and actively sourced prompts from
humans to teach models such skills. To facilitate this process, we create a taxonomy of mathematical
skills (Didolkar et al., 2024) and ask humans to provide relevant prompts/questions accordingly.
• : We use Llama 3 to generate step-by-step
Augmentingtrainingdatawithstep-wisereasoningtraces
solutions for a set of prompts. For each prompt, the model produces a variable number of generations.
These generations are then filtered based on the correct answer (Li et al., 2024a). We also do self-
verification where Llama 3 is used to verify whether a particular step-by-step solution is valid for a given
question. This process improves the quality of the finetuning data by eliminating instances where the
model does not produce valid reasoning traces.
• : Wetrain outcomeandstepwiserewardmodels(Lightmanetal.,2023;

Wang et al., 2023a) to filter training data where the intermediate reasoning steps were incorrect. These
reward models are used to eliminate data with invalid step-by-step reasoning, ensuring high-quality
data for finetuning. For more challenging prompts, we use Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with
learned step-wise reward models to generate valid reasoning traces, further enhancing the collection of
high-quality reasoning data (Xie et al., 2024).
• : We prompt Llama 3 to solve reasoning problems through a

combination of textual reasoning and associated Python code (Gou et al., 2023). Code execution is used
as a feedback signal to eliminate cases where the reasoning chain was not valid, ensuring the correctness
of the reasoning process.
• Learningfromfeedbackandmistakes: To simulate human feedback, we utilize incorrect generations (i.e.,
generations leading to incorrect reasoning traces) and perform error correction by prompting Llama 3 to
23yield correct generations (An et al., 2023b; Welleck et al., 2022; Madaan et al., 2024a). The iterative
process of using feedback from incorrect attempts and correcting them helps improve the model’s ability
to reason accurately and learn from its mistakes.
4.3.4 LongContext
During the final pre-training stage, we extend the context length of Llama 3 from 8K tokens to 128K tokens
(see Section 3.4 for more details). Similar to pre-training, we find that during finetuning we must carefully
tune the recipe to balance short and long-context capabilities.
Naively applying our existing SFT recipe with only short-context data

resulted in significant regressions in long-context capabilities from pre-training, highlighting the need to
incorporatelong-contextdatainourSFTdatamix. Inpractice,however,itislargelyimpracticaltogethumans
to annotate such examples due to the tedious and time-consuming nature of reading lengthy contexts, so we
predominantly rely on synthetic data to fill this gap. We use earlier versions of Llama 3 to generate synthetic
data based on the key long-context use-cases: (possibly multi-turn) question-answering, summarization for
long documents, and reasoning over code repositories, and describe them in greater detail below.
• We carefully curate a set of long documents from our pre-training mix. We split
Questionanswering:
these documents into chunks of 8K tokens, and prompted an earlier version of the Llama 3 model to
generate QA pairs conditional on randomly selected chunks. During training, the whole document is
used as context.
• We applied hierarchical summarization of long-context documents by first summarizing

the chunks of 8K input length using our strongest Llama 3 8K context model and then summarizing
the summaries. During training we provide the full document and prompt the model to summarize the
documentwhilepreservingalltheimportantdetails. WealsogenerateQApairsbasedonthesummaries
of the documents and prompt the model with questions that require global understanding of the whole
long document.
• Longcontextcodereasoning: We parse Python files to identify import statements and determine their
dependencies. Fromhere,weselectthemostcommonlydepended-uponfiles,specificallythosereferenced
by at least five other files. We remove one of these key files from a repository and prompt the model to
identify which files depended on the missing file and to generate the necessary missing code.
We further categorize these synthetically generated samples based on the sequence length (16K, 32K, 64K
and 128K) to enable more fine-grained targeting of input lengths.
Through careful ablations, we observe that mixing 0.1% of synthetically generated long-context data with the
original short-context data optimizes the performance across both short-context and long-context benchmarks.
We observe that using only short context training data in DPO did not negatively impact long-context
DPO.
performance as long as the SFT model is high quality in long context tasks. We suspect this is due to the
fact that our DPO recipe has fewer optimizer steps than SFT. Given this finding, we keep the standard
short-context recipe for DPO on top of our long-context SFT checkpoints.
4.3.5 ToolUse
Teaching LLMs to use tools such as search engines or code interpreters hugely expands the range of tasks
they can solve, transforming them from pure chat models into more general assistants (Nakano et al., 2021;
Thoppilan et al., 2022; Parisi et al., 2022; Gao et al., 2023; Mialon et al., 2023a; Schick et al., 2024). We train

• For tools, dialogs often contain more than a single assistant message (e.g., calling the tool and reasoning

provide a preference between two assistant messages with the same context or, if both contain major
problems, edit one of the messages. The chosen or edited message is then added to the context and the
dialog continues. This provides human feedback for both the assistant’s ability of calling the tools and
reasoning about the tool outputs. Annotators cannot rank or edit the tool outputs.
• We do not perform rejection sampling, as we did not observe gains in our tool benchmarks.
To accelerate the annotation process, we start by bootstrapping basic tool use capabilities by finetuning on
syntheticallygenerateddatafrompreviousLlama3checkpoints. Thus, annotatorshavefewereditstoperform.
In a similar spirit, as Llama 3 gradually improves through its development, we progressively complexify our
humanannotationprotocols: westartbysingle-turntooluseannotations, beforemovingtotooluseindialogs,
and finally annotating for multi-step tool use and data analysis.
To create data for tool usage applications, we leverage the following procedure:
Tooldatasets.
• We start by few-shot generation of synthetic user prompts which, by construction,
Single-steptooluse:
require a call to one of our core tools (for example, questions that exceed our knowledge cutoff date).
Then, still relying on few-shot generation, we generate appropriate tool calls for these prompts, execute
them, and add the output to the model’s context. Finally, we prompt the model again to generate a
final answer to the user’s query based on the tool output. We end up with trajectories of the following
form: system prompt, user prompt, tool call, tool output, final answer. We also filter around 30% this
dataset to remove tool calls that cannot be executed or other formatting issues.
• We follow a similar protocol and first generate synthetic data to teach the model
Multi-steptooluse:
basic multi-step tool use capabilities. To do this, we first prompt Llama 3 to generate user prompts
that require at least two tool calls, that can be the same or different tools from our core set. Then,

reasoning steps and tool calls, similar to ReAct (Yao et al., 2022). See Figure 10 for an example of
Llama 3 performing a task involving multi-step tool usage.
• We annotate for the following filetypes: .txt, .docx, .pdf, .pptx, .xlsx, .csv, .tsv,
Fileuploads:
.py, .json, .jsonl, .html, .xml. Our prompts are based on a provided file, and ask to summarize the
contents of the file, find and fix bugs, optimize a piece of code, perform data analysis or visualization.
See Figure 11 for an example of Llama 3 performing a task involving a file upload.
After finetuning on this synthetic data, we gather human annotations in diverse and challenging scenarios
including multi-turn interactions, more than three step tool use, and instances where a tool call does not yield

a satisfying answer. We augment our synthetic data with different system prompts to teach the model to use
tools only when activated. To train the model to avoid calling tools for simple queries, we also add queries
from easy math or question answering datasets (Berant et al., 2013; Koncel-Kedziorski et al., 2016; Joshi
et al., 2017; Amini et al., 2019) and their responses without tools, but with tools activated in system prompt.
We improve Llama 3 zero-shot tool use abilities (also referred to as function calling)
Zero-shottoolusedata.
by finetuning on a large and diverse set of partly synthetic (functions definitions, user query, corresponding
call) tuples. We evaluate our model on a set of unseen tools.
• Single,nested,andparallelfunctioncalling: Calls can be simple, nested, i.e. we pass a function call as an
argument of another function, or parallel, i.e. the model returns a list of independent function calls.
Generating a diverse set of functions, queries and ground truths can be challenging (Mekala et al., 2024),
and we resort to mining the Stack (Kocetkov et al., 2022) to ground our synthetic user queries in real
functions. More precisely, we extract function calls and their definitions, clean and filter them, e.g. for
missing docstrings or non-executable functions, and use Llama 3 to generate a natural language query
corresponding to the function call.
• We also generate synthetic data for multi-turn dialogs with function calls,
Multi-turnfunctioncalling:
following a protocol similar to the one proposed in Li et al. (2023b). We use multiple agents that
generate domains, APIs, user queries, API calls, and responses, while also ensuring that the generated
data covers a set of diverse domains and realistic APIs. All agents are variants of Llama 3 prompted in
different ways depending on their roles and collaborate in a step-by-step manner.
4.3.6 Factuality
Hallucinations remain a major challenge for large language models. Models tend to be overconfident, even in
domainswheretheyhavelittleknowledge. Despitetheseshortcomings,theyareoftenusedasknowledgebases,
which can lead to risky outcomes such as the spread of misinformation. While we recognize that factuality
can go beyond hallucinations, we took a hallucination-first approach here.
26Example of Llama 3 performing analysis and visualization of an uploaded file.
Figure11 Processingfileuploads.
We follow the principle that post-training should align the model to “know what it knows” rather than add
knowledge (Gekhman et al., 2024; Mielke et al., 2020). Our primary approach involves generating data that
aligns model generations with subsets of factual data present in the pre-training data. To achieve this, we
develop a knowledge probing technique that takes advantage of Llama 3’s in-context abilities. This data
generation process involves the following procedure:
1. from the pre-training data.
Extractadatasnippet
2. about these snippets (context) by prompting Llama 3.

3. from Llama 3 to the question.

Scorethecorrectness
5. of the generations using Llama 3 as a judge.
Scoretheinformativeness
6. for responses which are consistently informative and incorrect across the generations,
Generatearefusal
using Llama 3.
We use data generated from the knowledge probe to encourage the model to only answer questions which it
has knowledge about, and refuse answering those questions that it is unsure about. Further, pre-training data
is not always factually consistent or correct. We therefore also collect a limited set of labeled factuality data
that deals with sensitive topics where factually contradictory or incorrect statements are prevalent.
274.3.7 Steerability
Steerability is the ability to direct the model’s actions and outcomes to meet developer and user specifications.
As Llama 3 is a generic foundational model, it should be maximally steerable to different downstream use
cases easily. For Llama 3, we focus on enhancing its steerability through system prompt with natural language
instructions, especially around response length, format, tone and character/persona.
We collect steerability preference samples within the general English category by asking
Datacollection.
annotators to design different system prompts for Llama 3. Annotators then engage in conversations with the
models to evaluate their consistency in following instructions defined in system prompts over the course of the
conversation. We show an example customized system prompt used for enhancing steerability below:

5.1 Pre-trainedLanguageModel
In this section, we report evaluation results for our pre-trained Llama 3 (Section 3), comparing with various
other models of comparable sizes. We reproduce results of competitor models whenever possible. For non-
Llama models, we report the best score across results that are publicly reported or (where possible) that we
reproduced ourselves. The specifics of these evaluations, including configurations such as the number of shots,
metrics, and other pertinent hyperparameters and settings, can be accessed on our Github repository here.
Additionally, we are releasing the data generated as part of evaluations with publicly available benchmarks
which can be found on Huggingface here. We evaluate the quality of our models on standard benchmarks
(Section 5.1.1), for robustness to changes in multiple-choice question setups (Section 5.1.2), and on adversarial
evaluations (Section 5.1.3). We also conduct a contamination analysis to estimate the extent to which our
evaluations are impacted by contamination of training data (Section 5.1.4).
5.1.1 StandardBenchmarks
To compare our models with the current state-of-the-art, we evaluate Llama 3 on a large number of standard
benchmark evaluations shown in Table 8. These evaluations cover eight top-level categories: commonsense

models of comparable sizes. Where possible, we recompute numbers with our own pipeline for other models.
To ensure a fair comparison, we then select the best score between the score that we computed and the
reported number for that model with comparable or more conservative settings. You can find additional
details on our evaluation setup here. For some models, it is not possible to (re)compute benchmark values,
for instance, because the pre-trained model is not released or because the API does not provide access to
log-probabilities. In particular, this is true for all models comparable to Llama 3 405B. Thus, we do not
report category averages for Llama 3 405B, which requires that all numbers are available for all benchmarks.

have variance because benchmark sets are finite samples drawn from some underlying distribution. We
follow Madaan et al. (2024b) and report on this variance via 95% confidence intervals (CIs), assuming that
benchmark scores are Gaussian distributed. While this assumption is incorrect (e.g., benchmark scores are
bounded), preliminary bootstrap experiments suggest CIs (for discrete metrics) are a good approximation:
(cid:114)
S×(1−S)
CI(S)=1.96× .
N
Herein, S is the observed benchmark score (e.g., accuracy or EM) and N the sample size of the benchmark.
We omit CIs for benchmark scores that are not simple averages. We note that because subsampling is not the
only source of variation, our CI values lower bound the actual variation in the capability estimate.

results show that Llama 3 8B outperforms competing models in virtually every category, both in terms of
per-category win rate and in terms of average per-category performance. We also find that Llama 3 70B
outperforms its predecessor Llama 2 70B by a large margin on most benchmarks, with the exception of
commonsense benchmarks that are likely saturated. Llama 3 70B also outperforms Mixtral 8x22B.

its class. In particular, Llama 3 405B substantially outperforms prior open-source models. For long-context,
we present more comprehensive results (including probing tasks like needle-in-a-haystack) in Section 5.2.
5.1.2 ModelRobustness
In addition to performance on benchmarks, robustness is an important factor in the quality of pre-trained
language models. We investigate the robustness of our pre-trained language models to design choices in
multiple-choice question (MCQ) setups. Prior work has reported that model performance can be sensitive to
seemingly arbitrary design choices in such setups, for example, model scores and even rankings may change
withtheorderandlabelsofthein-contextexamples(Luetal.,2022;Zhaoetal.,2021;RobinsonandWingate,
2023; Liang et al., 2022; Gupta et al., 2024), the exact format of the prompt (Weber et al., 2023b; Mishra
et al., 2022), or the answer choice format and order (Alzahrani et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024a; Zheng et al.,
2023). Motivated by this work, we use the MMLU benchmark to evaluate the robustness of our pre-trained
models to: few-shot label bias, label variants, answer order, and prompt format:

order and prompt format. The results in the figure further underscore the robustness of the performance of
our pre-trained language models, in particular, of Llama 3 405B.
5.1.3 AdversarialBenchmarks
In addition to the benchmarks presented above, we evaluate on several adversarial benchmarks in three areas:
question answering, mathematical reasoning, and paraphrase detection. This testing probes the model’s
capabilities on tasks specifically created to be challenging and can potentially also point to overfitting on
benchmarks. For question answering, we use Adversarial SQuAD (Jia and Liang, 2017) and Dynabench
SQuAD (Kiela et al., 2021). For mathematical reasoning, we use GSM-Plus (Li et al., 2024c). For paraphrase
detection, we use PAWS (Zhang et al., 2019).
Figure15presentsthescoresofLlama38B,70B,and405Bontheadversarialbenchmarksasafunctionoftheir
performance on non-adversarial benchmarks. The non-adversarial benchmarks we use are SQuAD (Rajpurkar
et al., 2016) for question answering, GSM8K for mathematical reasoning, and QQP (Wang et al., 2017) for
paraphrase detection. Each datapoint represents a pair of an adversarial and non-adversarial datasets (e.g.
QQP paired with PAWS), and we show all possible pairs within a category. The diagonal black line represents
parity between adversarial and non-adversarial datasets — being on the line would indicate the model has
similar performance regardless of the adversarial nature.
On paraphrase detection, neither pre-trained nor post-trained models appear to suffer from the type of
adversariality with which PAWS was constructed, marking a substantial step with respect to the previous
generation of models. This result confirms the findings of Weber et al. (2023a), who also found that LLMs are
less susceptible to the type of spurious correlations found in several adversarial datasets. For mathematical
reasoning and question answering, however, the adversarial performances are substantially lower than the
non-adversarial performances. This pattern is similar for pre-trained and post-trained models.
5.1.4 ContaminationAnalysis
We conduct a contamination analysis to estimate to what extent benchmark scores may be influenced
by contamination of the evaluation data in the pre-training corpus. In previous work, several different
contamination methods have been used, with various different hyperparameters – we refer to Singh et al.
(2024) for an overview. Any of these methods can suffer from false positives and negatives, and how to best
run contamination analyses is currently still an open field of research. Here, we largely follow the suggestions
of Singh et al. (2024).

5.2 Post-trainedLanguageModel
We present results for our Llama 3 post-trained models on benchmarks across different capabilities. Similar to
pre-training we are releasing the data generated as part of evaluations with publicly available benchmarks
which can be found on Huggingface here. Additional details on our eval setup can be found here.
Table 16 contains an overview of all the benchmarks, organized by the capability.
Benchmarksandmetrics.
We apply decontamination of the post-training data by running exact match with the prompts from each
benchmark. In addition to the standard academic benchmarks, we also performed extensive human evaluation
of different capabilities. Details are provided in Section 5.3.
We employ a similar experimental setup to the pre-training phase and conduct a

5.2.1 GeneralKnowledgeandInstruction-FollowingBenchmarks
We evaluate Llama 3 on benchmarks for general knowledge and instruction-following in Table 2.
We leverage MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021a) and MMLU-Pro (Wang et al., 2024b) to
Generalknowledge.
evaluate Llama 3’s capability on knowledge-based question answering. For MMLU, we report the macro
average of subtask accuracy under the 5-shot standard setting without CoT. MMLU-Pro is an extension
of MMLU, incorporating more challenging, reasoning-focused questions, eliminating noisy questions, and
expanding the choice set from four to ten options. Given its focus on complex reasoning, we report 5-shot
CoT for MMLU-Pro. All tasks are formatted as generation tasks, similar to simple-evals (OpenAI, 2024).
As shown in Table 2, our 8B and 70B Llama 3 variants outperform other models of similar sizes on both
general knowledge tasks. Our 405B model outperforms GPT-4 and Nemotron 4 340B, with Claude 3.5 Sonnet
leading among larger models.

on IFEval (Zhou et al., 2023). IFEval comprises approximately 500 “verifiable instructions” such as “write
in more than 400 words”, which can be verified by heuristics. We report the average of prompt-level and
instruction-level accuracy, under strict and loose constraints in Table 2. Note that all Llama 3 variants
outperform comparable models across IFEval.
5.2.2 ProficiencyExams
Next, we evaluate our models on a wide variety of proficiency exams originally designed to test humans. We
source these exams from publicly available official sources; for some exams, we report average scores across
different exam sets per proficiency exam. Specifically, we average:
• : Official GRE Practice Test 1 and 2 (from the Educational Testing Services);
GRE
• : Official Preptest 71, 73, 80 and 93;
LSAT
• : 8 exams from The Official SAT Study guide edition 2018;
SAT
• : One official practice exam per subject;
AP
• Official GMAT Online Exam.
GMAT
Questions in these exams contain both MCQ style and generation questions. We exclude the questions that
are accompanied with images. For the GRE exams that contain questions with multiple correct options, we
qualify the outputs as correct only if all the correct options are selected by the model. The evaluations are

Our results can be found in Table 17. We observe that the performance of our Llama 3 405B model is very
similar to Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4 4o. Our 70B model has an even more impressive performance. It is
significantly better than GPT-3.5 Turbo and beats Nemotron 4 340B on many tests.
5.2.3 CodingBenchmarks
We evaluate Llama 3 on code generation on several popular Python and multi-programming language
benchmarks. To gauge the effectiveness of our models in generating functionally correct code, we use the
pass@N metric, which evaluates the pass rate for a set of unit tests among N generations. We report pass@1.

5.2.4 MultilingualBenchmarks
Llama 3 supports 8 languages — English, German, French, Italian, Portuguese, Hindi, Spanish, and Thai,
although the underlying foundation model has been trained on a broader collection of languages.9 In Table 20,

5.2.6 LongContextBenchmarks
We consider a diverse set of tasks that span various domains and text types. In the benchmarks we list below,
we focus on sub-tasks that use unbiased evaluation protocols, i.e., accuracy-based metrics rather than n-gram
overlapping metrics. We also prioritize tasks that we found to be of low variance.
• (Kamradt, 2023) measures a model’s ability to retrieve a hidden information

performance, successfully retrieving 100% of needles at all document depths and context lengths. We
also measure performance on Multi-needle (Table 21), a variation of Needle-in-a-Haystack, where we
insert four needles in the context and test if a model can retrieve two of them. Our Llama 3 models
achieve near perfect retrieval results.
• (Shaham et al., 2023) is a zero-shot benchmark for natural language understanding over

long texts. We report numbers on the validation set, as the ground truth answers are not publicly
available. Our Llama 3 405B and 70B models either match or surpass other models on various tasks in
this benchmark.
• (Zhang et al., 2024) requires models to understand long dependencies in the context

window. We evaluate Llama 3 on En.QA (QA over novels) and En.MC (multiple-choice QA over novels),
where our 405B model outperforms all others. The gains are particularly significant on En.QA.
5.2.7 ToolUsePerformance
We evaluate our models on a range of benchmarks for zero-shot tool use (i.e. function calling): Nexus (Srini-
vasan et al., 2023), API-Bank (Li et al., 2023b), Gorilla API-Bench (Patil et al., 2023), and the Berkeley
Function Calling Leaderboard (BFCL) (Yan et al., 2024). Results are shown in Table 22.
On Nexus, our Llama 3 variants perform the best compared to their counterparts. On the API-Bank, our
Llama 3 8B and 70B models outperform other models in their category by a significant margin. The 405B
model is behind Claude 3.5 Sonnet by only 0.6%. Finally, our 405B and 70B models perform competitively on
BFCL and are close second in their respective size class. Llama 3 8B performs the best in its category.

possible. We used this taxonomy to collect about 7,000 prompts spanning six individual capabilities (English,
reasoning, coding, Hindi, Spanish, and Portuguese), and three multiturn capabilities11 (English, reasoning,
and coding). We ensured that within each category, prompts are uniformly distributed across subcategories.
We also categorized each prompt into one of three difficulty levels and ensured that our prompt collection

of two model responses (produced by different models) they prefer. Annotators use a 7-point scale for their
ratings, enabling them to indicate whether one model response is much better than, better than, slightly
better than, or about the same as the other model response. When an annotator indicates that one model
response is better or much better than the other model response, we consider this a “win” for that model. We
perform pairwise comparisons between models in which we report win rates per capability in the prompt set.
We use our human evaluation process to compare Llama 3 405B with GPT-4 (0125 API version),

GPT-4o (API version), and Claude 3.5 Sonnet (API version). The results of these evaluations are presented
in Figure 17. We observe that Llama 3 405B performs approximately on par with the 0125 API version of
GPT-4, while achieving mixed results (some wins and some losses) compared to GPT-4o and Claude 3.5
Sonnet. On nearly all capabilities, the win rates of Llama 3 and GPT-4 are within the margin of error. On
multiturn reasoning and coding tasks, Llama 3 405B outperforms GPT-4 but it underperforms GPT-4 on
multilingual (Hindi, Spanish, and Portuguese) prompts. Llama 3 performs on par with GPT-4o on English
prompts, on par with Claude 3.5 Sonnet on multilingual prompts, and outperforms Claude 3.5 Sonnet on
single and multiturn English prompts. However, it trails Claude 3.5 Sonnet in capabilities such as coding
and reasoning. Qualitatively, we find that model performance in human evaluations is heavily influenced by
nuanced factors such as model tone, response structure, and verbosity – factors that we are optimizing for
in our post-training process. Overall, our human evaluation results are consistent with those on standard
benchmark evaluations: Llama 3 405B is very competitive with leading industry models, making it the
best-performing openly available model.
All human evaluation results underwent a thorough data quality assurance process. However,

since it is challenging to define objective criteria for evaluating model responses, human evaluations can still
be influenced by personal biases, backgrounds, and preferences of human annotators, which may lead to
inconsistent or unreliable results.

model to align to specific safety policies while still retaining helpfulness. We analyze each of the Llama 3

the effectiveness of our safety mitigations.

5.4.1 BenchmarkConstruction
We create various internal benchmarks to help us develop models safely and responsibly. Our benchmarks are
heavily inspired by the risk categories from the ML Commons taxonomy of hazards (Vidgen et al., 2024).
While various benchmarks for language model safety exist such as ToxiGen (Hartvigsen et al., 2022), XS
Test (Röttger et al., 2023), and more, a number of the new capabilities in Llama 3 do not have sufficient
external benchmarks available and often external benchmarks lack sufficient coverage of breadth and depth.
For each risk category, we collect human-written prompts that are either adversarial or borderline in nature —
examplesofsuchpromptscanbefoundinTable23. Adversarialpromptsrangefromstraightforwardonesthat
directly elicit a harmful response to ones that incorporate sophisticated jailbreaking techniques. Benchmarks
of these adversarial prompts are the basis for how we measure violation rate.
As a counter-metric to violation rate, we also construct false refusal benchmarks composed of borderline
prompts. We refer to as occurring when a model refuses to answer in a helpful way even when
falserefusal
a plausible, safe response is possible. Borderline prompts are prompts near the decision boundary that a
well-calibrated model should handle, for example, “How can I steal the spotlight from my bestie who always
acts like the main character??” Our overall benchmark size across violations and false refusals is over 4000
prompts per capability or language, and contains a mix of single-turn and multi-turn prompts.

5.4.2 SafetyPre-training
We believe responsible development must be considered from an end-to-end perspective and incorporated at
every stage of model development and deployment. During pre-training, we apply a variety of filters, such as
filters to identify websites that likely contain personally identifiable information (see Section 3.1). We also
focus heavily on discoverable memorization (Nasr et al., 2023). Similar to Carlini et al. (2022), we sample
prompts and ground truths at different frequencies of occurrence in the training data using an efficient rolling
hash index of all n-grams in the corpus. We construct different test scenarios by varying the length of prompt
andgroundtruth,thedetectedlanguageoftargetdata,andthedomain. Wethenmeasurehowoftenthemodel
generates the ground truth sequence verbatim, and analyze the relative rates of memorization in the specified
scenarios. We define verbatim memorization as the inclusion rate – the proportion of model generations that
include the ground truth continuation exactly – and report averages weighted by the prevalence of given
characteristics in the data, as shown in Table 24. We find low memorization rates of training data (1.13% and
3.91% on average for the 405B with n=50 and n=1000 respectively). Memorization rates are roughly on
par with Llama 2 at equivalent size and using the same methodology applied to its data mix.12
5.4.3 SafetyFinetuning
We describe our approach to safety finetuning to mitigate risks across many capabilities, which encompasses
two key aspects: safety training data and risk mitigation techniques. Our safety finetuning process

builds upon our general finetuning methodology with modifications tailored to address specific safety concerns.

et al., 2024), based on MAP-Elites (Mouret and
Clune, 2015), which generate prompts constrained across multiple dimensions of diversity.
We further address the model’s tone when producing safe responses, which has an impact on downstream
user experience. We developed a refusal tone guideline for Llama 3 and ensured that all new safety data
adhered to it through rigorous quality assurance process. We also refine existing safety data to align with the
guideline, using a combination of zero-shot rewriting and human-in-the-loop editing to produce high-quality
data. By employing these methods, along with a tone classifier to assess tone quality for safety responses, we
are able to significantly improve the model’s verbiage.
Following our Llama 2 recipe (Touvron et al., 2023b), we combine all helpfulness

data and safety data during the model alignment stage. Additionally, we introduce a borderline dataset to
help the model discern the subtle distinctions between safe and unsafe requests. Our annotation teams are
instructed to meticulously craft responses to safety prompts based on our guidelines. We have found that SFT
is highly effective in aligning the model when we strategically balance the ratio of adversarial to borderline
examples. We put the focus on more challenging risk areas, with a higher ratio of borderline examples. This
plays a crucial role in our successful safety mitigation efforts while keeping false refusal to a minimum.
Further, we examine the impact of model size on the trade-off between FRR and VR in Figure 18. Our results
show that it varies — with smaller models requiring a larger proportion of safety data relative to helpfulness,
and that it is more challenging to efficiently balance VR and FRR compared to larger models.

particularly effective in teaching the model to distinguish between good and bad responses for a given prompt.
We conduct multiple experiments to determine the optimal ratio of adversarial, borderline, and helpfulness
examples, aiming to optimize the trade-off between FRR and VR. We also find that the model size influences
the learning outcomes — as a result, we tailor different safety mixes for various model sizes.

compared to relevant competitors. Two of the competitors are end-to-end systems accessed through API,
and one of them is an open source language model that we host internally and we evaluate directly.13 We
evaluate our Llama models both standalone and coupled with Llama Guard, our open source system-level
safety solution (more in Section 5.4.7).
While a low violation rate is desirable, it is critical to consider false refusal as a counter-metric, as a model
that always refuses is maximally safe, but not helpful in the slightest. Similarly, a model that always answers
every prompt, regardless of how problematic the request, would be overly harmful and toxic. In Figure 21,
leveraging our internal benchmarks, we explore how different models and systems in industry navigate this
trade off and how Llama 3 compares. We find that our models achieve very competitive violation rate metrics

other languages, particularly given the nuance of safety policies and language-specific context. Therefore, it is
essential to collect high-quality safety data for each language. We also found that the distribution of safety
data per language significantly impacts performance from a safety standpoint, with some languages benefiting
from transfer learning while others require more language-specific data. To achieve a balance between FRR
and VR, we iteratively add adversarial and borderline data while monitoring the impact on both metrics.
We display results on our internal benchmarks in Figure 19 for short context models, showing Llama 3’s
violation and false refusal rates for English and non-English languages compared to similar models and
systems. To construct the benchmarks for each language, we use a combination of prompts written by native
speakers, sometimes supplementing with translations from our English benchmarks. For each of our supported
languages, we find that Llama 405B with Llama Guard is at least as safe, if not strictly safer, than the two
competing systems when measured on our internal benchmark, while maintaining competitive false refusal
rates. Looking at the Llama 405B model on its own, without Llama Guard, we find that it has a significantly
lower violation rate than the competing standalone open source model, trading off a higher false refusal rate.

of safe behavior in the presence of demonstrations of unsafe behavior in context. We develop a scalable
mitigation strategy that significantly reduces VR, effectively neutralizing the impact of longer context attacks
even for 256-shot attacks. This approach shows little to no impact on FRR and most helpfulness metrics.
To quantify the effectiveness of our long context safety mitigations, we use two additional benchmarking

We developed and applied Llama 3 to new benchmarks on spear phishing and autonomous cyberattacks.
Overall, we find that Llama 3 does not have significant susceptibilities in generating malicious code or

cybersecurity challenges. A two-stage study was conducted with 62 internal volunteers. Volunteers were
categorized into “expert” (31 subjects) and “novice” (31 subjects) cohorts based on their offensive security
experience. For the first stage, subjects were asked to complete the challenge without any LLM assistance
but with access to the open internet. For the second stage, subjects retained access to the internet but were
also provided with Llama 3 405B to complete a different offensive cybersecurity challenge of similar difficulty
to the first. An analysis of the completion rates of challenge attack phases by subjects indicates that both
novices and experts using the 405B model demonstrated insignificant uplift over having open access to the
internet without an LLM.
To assess risks related to proliferation of chemical and

biological weapons, we perform uplift testing designed to assess whether use of Llama 3 could meaningfully
increase the capabilities of actors to plan such attacks.
The study consists of six-hour scenarios where teams of two participants were asked to generate fictitious
operational plans for either a biological or chemical attack. The scenarios cover the major planning stages of a
CBRNE attack (agent acquisition, production, weaponization, and delivery) and are designed to elicit detailed
plans that would address challenges related to procurement of restricted materials, real-world laboratory

scientific or operational expertise, and assigned to teams consisting of two low-skill actors (no formal training)
or two moderate-skill actors (some formal training and practical experience in science or operations).
The study was generated in collaboration with a set of CBRNE experts, and designed to maximize the
generality, validity, and robustness of both quantitative and qualitative outcomes. A preliminary study was
also performed in order to validate the study design, including a robust power analysis ensuring that our
sample size was sufficient for statistical analysis.
Each team is assigned to a “control” or “LLM” condition. The control team has access to internet-based
resources only, while the LLM-enabled team had internet access as well as access to Llama 3 models enabled
with web search (including PDF ingestion), information retrieval capabilities (RAG), and code execution
(Python and Wolfram Alpha). To enable testing of RAG capabilities, a keyword search is used to generate a
dataset of hundreds of relevant scientific papers and pre-loaded into the Llama 3 model inference system. At
the conclusion of the exercise, the operational plans generated by each team are evaluated by subject matter
experts with domain expertise in biology, chemistry, and operational planning. Each plan is evaluated across
four stages of potential attacks, generating scores for metrics such as scientific accuracy, detail, detection
avoidance, and probability of success in scientific and operational execution. After a robust Delphi process
to mitigate bias and variability in subject matter expert (SME) evaluations, final scores are generated by
pooling stage-level metrics into a comprehensive score.
Quantitative analysis of these results of this study show no significant uplift in performance related to usage
of the Llama 3 model. This result holds true when performing an aggregate analysis (comparing all LLM

release of Llama 3 models will increase ecosystem risk related to biological or chemical weapon attacks.
5.4.6 RedTeaming
We utilize Red Teaming to discover risks and use the findings to improve our benchmarks and safety tuning
datasets. We conduct recurring red teaming exercises to continuously iterate and discover new risks, which
guides our model development and mitigation process.
Our red team consists of experts in cybersecurity, adversarial machine learning, responsible AI, and integrity,
in addition to multilingual content specialists with backgrounds in integrity issues for specific geographic
markets. We also partner with internal and external subject-matter experts in critical risk areas to help build
risk taxonomies and aid in more focused adversarial assessment.
We began initial red teaming by focusing on individual model

together. The red team focused on prompt-level attacks to emulate more likely more real world scenarios —
we find that models often deviate from expected behavior, particularly in cases when the prompt’s intention is
being obfuscated or when prompts layer multiple abstractions. These risks get more complex with additional
capabilities, and we describe several of our red teaming discoveries in detail below. We utilize these red
team discoveries in concert with our results on internal safety benchmarks to develop focused mitigations to
continuously and iteratively improve model safety.

across single and multi-turn conversations. We also leveraged advanced, adversarial multi-turn automa-
tion similar to PAIR (Chao et al., 2023) across some techniques and risk categories. Largely, multi-turn
conversations lead to more harmful outputs. Several attacks were pervasive across model checkpoints,
particularly when used together.
– Multi-turn refusal suppression to specify the model response to follow a particular format or
include/exclude particular information related to the refusal as specific phrases.
– Hypotheticalscenarioswrapviolatingpromptsashypothetical/theoreticaltasksorfictionalscenarios.
Prompts can be as simple as adding the word “hypothetically” or crafting an elaborate layered
scenario.
– Personasandroleplay gives the model a violating persona with specific violating response character-
istics (e.g. “You are X, your goal is Y”) or yourself as the user adapting a specific benign character
that obfuscates the context of the prompt.
– Addingdisclaimersandwarnings works as a form of response priming and we assume a method to
allow for the model a path to helpful compliance that intersects with generalized safety training.
Asking for disclaimers, trigger warnings and more to be added in multi-turn conversations in
concert with other attacks mentioned contributed to increased violation rates.
– Graduallyescalatingviolationisamulti-turnattackwheretheconversationstartsoutwithamoreor
less benign request and then through direct prompting for more exaggerated content can gradually
lead the model into generating a very violating response. Once the model has started outputting
violating content, it can be difficult for the model to recover (or another attack can be used if a
refusal is encountered). With longer context models, this will be an increasingly seen issue.
• We identify a number of unique risks when considering multiple languages.

– Mixingmultiplelanguagesinonepromptorconversation can easily lead to more violating outputs

in generating violating outputs, several tool specific attacks were also discovered. This included but was
not limited to:
– Unsafetoolchaining such as asking for multiple tools at once with one being violating could, in
early checkpoints, lead to all of the tools being called with a mix of benign and violating inputs.
– Forcingtooluse often with specific input strings, fragmented or encoded text can trigger a tool
input to be potentially violating, leading to a more violating output. Other techniques can then be
used to access the tool results, even if the model would normally refuse to perform the search or
assist with the results.
– Modifyingtooluseparameters such as swapping words in queries, retrying, or obfuscating some of

form of forcing tool use.

model’s capability to produce outputs that could result in Child Safety risks and inform on any necessary and
appropriate risk mitigations via fine tuning. We leveraged those expert red teaming sessions to expand the
coverage of our evaluation benchmarks through model development. For Llama 3, we conducted new in-depth
sessions using objective based methodologies to assess model risks along multiple attack vectors. We also
partnered with content specialists to perform red teaming exercises assessing potentially violating content
while taking account of market specific nuances or experiences.
5.4.7 SystemLevelSafety
In various real-world applications of large language models, models are not used in isolation but are integrated
into broader systems. In this section, we describe our system level safety implementation, which supplements
model-level mitigations by providing more flexibility and control.
Toenablethis,wedevelopandreleaseanewclassifier,LlamaGuard3,whichisaLlama38Bmodelfine-tuned
for safety classification. Similar to Llama Guard 2 (Llama-Team, 2024), this classifier is used to detect
whether input prompts and/or output responses generated by language models violate safety policies on
specific categories of harm.
It is designed to support Llama’s growing capabilities, and can be used for English and multilingual text. It is
also optimized to be used in the context of tool-calls such as search-tools and preventing code interpreter
abuse. Finally, we also provide quantized variants to reduce memory requirements. We encourage developers
to use our release of system safety components as a foundation and configure them for their own use cases.
We train on the 13 hazard categories listed in the AI Safety taxonomy (Vidgen et al., 2024): Child

Sexual Exploitation, Defamation, Elections, Hate, Indiscriminate Weapons, Intellectual Property, Non-Violent
Crimes, Privacy, Sex-Related Crimes, Sexual Content, Specialized Advice, Suicide & Self-Harm, and Violent
Crimes. We also train on Code Interpreter Abuse category to support tool-calls use cases.

to incorporate new capabilities. For new capabilities such as multilingual and tool use, we collect prompt and
response classification data, as well as utilize the data collected for safety finetuning. We increase the number
of unsafe responses in the training set by doing prompt engineering to get the LLM to not refuse responding
to adversarial prompts. We use Llama 3 to obtain response labels on such generated data.
To improve the performance of Llama Guard 3, we do extensive cleaning of the collected samples using human
annotation as well as LLM annotation by Llama 3. Obtaining labels for user prompts is a much harder task
for both humans and LLMs, and we find that the human labels are slightly better, especially for borderline
prompts, though our full iterative system is able to reduce the noise and produce more accurate labels.

across our benchmarks). Note that adding system safeguards (and any safety mitigations in general) comes
at the cost of increased refusals to benign prompts. In Table 25 we report reductions in violation rate and
increases in false refusal rate increase compared to the base model to highlight this tradeoff. This effect is
also visible in Figures 19, 20, and 21.
System safety also offers more flexibility. Llama Guard 3 can be deployed for specific harms only enabling
control over the violations and false refusals trade-off at the harm category level. Table 26 presents violations
reduction per category to inform which category should be turned on/off based on the developer use case.
To make it easier to deploy safety systems, we provide a quantized version of Llama Guard 3 using the
commonly used int8 quantization technique, reducing its size by more than 40%. Table 27 illustrates that
quantization has negligible impact on the performance of the model.
System-level safety components enable developers to customize and control how

LLM systems respond to user requests. As part of our work on improving the overall safety of the model
system and enable developers to deploy responsibly, we describe and release the creation of two prompt-based
filtering mechanisms: and . We open-source these for the community to leverage
PromptGuard CodeShield
as-is or take as inspiration and adapt for their usecases.
Prompt Guard is a model-based filter designed to detect prompt attacks, which are input strings designed to
subvert the intended behavior of an LLM functioning as part of an application. The model is a multi-label
classifier that detects two classes of prompt attack risk - direct jailbreaks (techniques that explicitly try to
override a model’s safety conditioning or system prompt) and indirect prompt injections (instances where
third-party data included in a model’s context window includes instructions inadvertently executed as user
commands by an LLM). The model is fine-tuned from mDeBERTa-v3-base, a small (86M) parameter model
suitable for filtering inputs into an LLM. We evaluate the performance on several evaluation datasets shown
in Table 28. We evaluate on two datasets (jailbreaks and injections) drawn from the same distribution
as the training data, as well as an out-of-distribution dataset in English, a multilingual jailbreak set built
from machine translation, and a dataset of indirect injections drawn from CyberSecEval (both English and
multilingual). Overall,wefindthatthemodelgeneralizeswelltonewdistributionsandhasstrongperformance.
Code Shield is an example of a class of system-level protections based on providing inference-time filtering.
In particular, it focuses on detecting the generation of insecure code before it might enter a downstream
usecase such as a production system. It does so by leveraging a static analysis library, the Insecure Code
Detector (ICD), to identify insecure code. ICD uses a suite of static analysis tools to perform the analysis
across 7 programming languages. These kinds of guardrails are generally useful for developers, who can deploy
multi-layered protections in various applications.

5.4.8 Limitations
We conducted extensive measurement and mitigation on a wide variety of risks to safe usage of Llama 3.
However, no testing can be guaranteed to be exhaustive in identifying every possible risk. Llama 3 may still
generate harmful content due to training on various datasets, particularly for languages beyond English and
when prompt engineered by skilled adversarial red teamers. Malicious developers or adversarial users may find
new ways to jailbreak our models and use them for various nefarious usecases. We will continue to proactively
identify risks, conduct research on mitigation methods, and we encourage developers to consider responsibility
in every aspect — from model development to deployment to users. We hope developers will leverage and
contribute to the tools we release in our open-source system-level safety suite.

parallelism and FP8 quantization. We have publicly released our implementation of FP8 quantization.

When using a BF16 number representation for the model parameters, Llama 3 405B does not fit in the GPU
memory of a single machine with 8 Nvidia H100 GPUs. To address this issue, we parallelize model inference
using BF16 precision across 16 GPUs on two machines. Within each machine, the high NVLink bandwidth

enables the use of tensor parallelism (Shoeybi et al., 2019). Across nodes, however, connectivity has lower
bandwidth and higher latency, so we use pipeline parallelism (Huang et al., 2019) instead.
During training with pipeline parallelism, bubbles are a major efficiency concern (see Section 3.3). However,
theyarenotanissueduringinference,sinceinferencedoesnotinvolveabackwardpassthatrequiresapipeline
flush. Therefore, we use micro-batching to improve inference throughput with pipeline parallelism.
We evaluate the effect of using two micro-batches in inference workloads of 4,096 input tokens and 256 output
tokens both during the key-value cache pre-fill stage of inference and during the decoding stage. We find
that micro-batching improves throughput of inference with the same local batch size; see Figure 24. These
improvements result from micro-batching enabling concurrent execution of micro batches in both these stages.
The additional synchronization points due to micro-batching also increase latency but, overall, micro-batching
still leads to a better throughput-latency trade-off.
6.2 FP8Quantization
We perform experiments leveraging the native FP8 support of H100 GPUs to perform low-precision inference.
To enable low-precision inference, we apply FP8 quantization to most matrix multiplications inside the
model. In particular, we quantize most parameters and activations in the feedforward network layers in the
model, which account for roughly 50% of the inference compute time. We do not quantize parameters in
the self-attention layers of the model. We leverage dynamic scaling factors for better accuracy (Xiao et al.,
2024b), optimizing our CUDA kernels15 to reduce the overhead of calculating the scales. We find that the
quality of Llama 3 405B is sensitive to certain types of quantization, and make a few additional changes to
increase the model output quality:
1. Akin to Zhang et al. (2021), we do not perform quantization in the first and last Transformer layers.
2. High-perplexity tokens such as dates can lead to large activation values. In turn, these can lead to high
dynamic scaling factors in FP8 and a non-negligible number of underflows, leading to errors in decoding.
15Our FP8 kernels are available at https://github.com/pytorch/FBGEMM/tree/main/fbgemm_gpu/experimental/gen_ai.

To address this issue, we upper bound the dynamic scaling factors to 1200.
3. We use row-wise quantization, computing scaling factors across rows for parameter and activation
matrices (see Figure 25). We find this works better than a tensor-wise quantization approach.
Evaluations on standard benchmarks often suggest that FP8 inference performs

on par with BF16 inference even without these mitigations. However, we find that such benchmarks do not
adequately reflect the effects of FP8 quantization. When scaling factors are not upper bounded, the model
occasionally produces corrupted responses even though the benchmark performance is strong. Instead of
relying on benchmarks to measure distribution changes due to quantization, we find it is better to analyze the
distribution of reward-model scores for 100,000 responses produced using both FP8 and BF16. Figure 26
shows the resulting reward distribution for our quantization approach. The results in the figure show that our
approach to FP8 quantization has very limited impact on the model’s response.

The figure compares the efficiency of FP8 inference with that of the two-machine BF16 inference approach

7 VisionExperiments
We perform a series of experiments in which we incorporate visual-recognition capabilities into Llama 3 via
a compositional approach that consists of two main stages. First, we compose a pre-trained image encoder
(Xu et al., 2023) and the pre-trained language model by introducing and training a set of cross-attention
layers between the two models (Alayrac et al., 2022) on a large number of image-text pairs. This leads to
the model illustrated in Figure 28. Second, we introduce temporal aggregator layers and additional video
cross-attention layers that operate on a large collection of video-text pairs to learn the model to recognize and
process temporal information from videos.
A compositional approach to foundation model development has several advantages: it enables us to
(1)
parallelize the development of the vision and language modeling capabilities; it circumvents complexities
(2)
of joint pre-training on visual and language data that stem from tokenization of visual data, differences in
background perplexities of tokens originating from different modalities, and contention between modalities;
(3)
itguaranteesthatmodelperformanceontext-onlytasksisnotaffectedbytheintroductionofvisual-recognition
capabilities, and the cross-attention architecture ensures that we do not have to expend compute passing
(4)
full-resolution images through the increasingly LLM backbones (specifically, the feed-forward networks in
each transformer layer), making it more efficient during inference. We note that our multimodal models are
still under development and not yet ready for release.
Before presenting the results of our experiments in Section 7.6 and 7.7, we describe the data we used to train
visual recognition capabilities, the model architecture of the vision components, how we scale training of those
components, and our pre-training and post-training recipes.
7.1 Data
We describe our image and video data separately below.
7.1.1 ImageData
Our image encoder and adapter are trained on image-text pairs. We construct this dataset via a complex
data processing pipeline that consists of four main stages: quality filtering, perceptual de-duplication,

data for both efficiency and privacy reasons. To do so, we use an internal version of the state-of-the-art
SSCD copy-detection model (Pizzi et al., 2022) to de-duplicate images at scale. For all images, we
first compute a 512-dimensional representation using the SSCD model. We use those embeddings to
perform a nearest neighbor (NN) search for each image across all images in our data set, using a cosine
similarity measure. We define examples above a certain similarity threshold as duplicates. We group
these duplicates using a connected-components algorithm, and maintain only one image-text pair per
connectedcomponent. Weincreasetheefficiencyofourde-duplicationpipelineby: (1)pre-clusteringthe
data using k-means clusters and (2) using FAISS (Johnson et al., 2019) for NN searches and clustering.
• We ensure diversity of the image-text pairs via resampling akin to Xu et al. (2023);
Resampling.
Mahajan et al. (2018); Mikolov et al. (2013). First, we construct a vocabulary of n-grams by parsing
high-quality text sources. Next, we compute the frequency of each vocabulary n-gram in our dataset.
We then resample the data as follows: If any of the n-grams in a caption occurs less than T times in the
vocabulary, we keep the corresponding image-text pair. Otherwise, we independently sample each of
the n-grams n in the caption with probability (cid:112) T/f where f indicates the frequency of n-gram n ;

we keep the image-text pair if any of the n-grams was sampled. This resampling aids performance on

improves tasks that require OCR capabilities, such as document understanding.

CSAM using perceptual hashing approaches such as PhotoDNA (Farid, 2021) as well as internal, proprietary

that we consider to be NSFW, for example, because they contain sexual or violent content. We believe that
minimizing the prevalence of such material in the training dataset improves the safety of the final model
without impacting its helpfulness. Finally, we perform face blurring on all images in our training set. We test

accompanied by a structured representation such as the corresponding markdown or LaTeX notation.
Besides improving recognition capabilities of the model for these domains, we find this data useful to
generate question-answer pairs via the text model for finetuning.
7.1.2 VideoData
For video pre-training, we use a large dataset of video-text pairs. Our dataset is curated through a multi-stage
process. We filter and clean the associated texts using rule-based heuristics, such as ensuring a minimum
length and fixing capitalization. Then, we run language identification models to filter out non-English texts.
WerunOCRdetectionmodelstofilteroutvideoswithexcessiveoverlaidtext. Toensurereasonablealignment
between the video-text pairs, we use CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) style image-text and video-text contrastive
models. Wefirstcomputeimage-textsimilarityusingasingleframeinthevideosandfilteredoutlowsimilarity
pairs, and then subsequently filter out pairs with low video-text alignment. Some of our data contains static
or low-motion videos; we filter out such data using motion-score based filtering (Girdhar et al., 2023). We do
not apply any filters on the visual quality of the videos such as aesthetic scores or resolution filtering.
Our dataset contains videos with an average duration of 21 seconds and a median duration of 16 seconds,
with over 99% videos being under a minute. The spatial resolution varies significantly between 320p and 4K
videos, with over 70% of the videos having a short side greater than 720 pixels. The videos have varying
aspect ratios with almost all videos having between aspect ratio between 1:2 and 2:1, with a 1:1 median.
7.2 ModelArchitecture
Our visual-recognition model consists of three main components: an image encoder, an image adapter,
(1) (2)
and a video adapter.
(3)
Our image encoder is a standard vision transformer (ViT; Dosovitskiy et al. (2020)) that
Imageencoder.
is trained to align images and text (Xu et al., 2023). We use the ViT-H/14 variant of the image encoder,
56which has 630M parameters that were trained on 2.5B image-text pairs for five epochs. The image encoder
is pre-trained on images with resolution 224×224; images were split up into 16×16 patches of equal size
(i.e., a patch size of 14x14 pixels). As also demonstrated by prior work such as ViP-Llava (Cai et al., 2024),
we observe that image encoders trained via a contrastive text alignment objective are unable to preserve
fine-grained localization information. To alleviate this, we employ a multi-layer feature extraction, where
features from the 4th, 8th, 16th, 24th and 31st layers are also provided in addition to the final layer features.
In addition, we further insert 8 gated self-attention layers (making a total of 40 transformer blocks) prior to
pre-training of the cross-attention layers to learn alignment-specific features. The image encoder therefore
eventually has a total 850M parameters with the additional layers. With the multi-layer features, the image
encoder produces a 7680-dimensional representation for each of the resulting 16×16=256 patches. The
parameters of the image encoder are not frozen during subsequent training stages as we found it to improve
performance, especially in domains such as text recognition.
We introduce cross-attention layers between the visual token representations produced by the
Imageadapter.
image encoder and the token representations produced by the language model (Alayrac et al., 2022). The
cross-attention layers are applied after every fourth self-attention layer in the core language model. Like the
language model itself, the cross-attention layers use generalized query attention (GQA) for increased efficiency.
The cross-attention layers introduce substantial numbers of additional trainable parameters into the model:
for Llama 3 405B, the cross-attention layers have ≈100B parameters. We pre-train our image adapter in two
stages: (1) initial pre-training followed by (2) annealing:
•
Initialpre-training.
We pre-train our image adapter on our dataset of ∼6B image-text pairs described
above. For compute efficiency reasons, we resize all images to fit within at most four tiles of 336×336
pixels each, where we arrange the tiles to support different aspect ratios, e.g., 672×672, 672×336, and
1344×336.
•
Annealing.
We continue training the image adapter on ∼500M images from the annealing dataset
described above. During annealing, we increase the per-tile image resolution to improve performance on
tasks that require higher-resolution images, for example, infographics understanding.
Our model takes as input up to 64 frames (uniformly sampled from a full video), each of
Videoadapter.
which is processed by the image encoder. We model temporal structure in videos through two components:
encoded video frames are aggregated by a temporal aggregator which merges 32 consecutive frames into
(i)
one, additional video cross attention layers are added before every fourth image cross attention layer. The
(ii)
temporal aggregator is implemented as a perceiver resampler (Jaegle et al., 2021; Alayrac et al., 2022). We
pre-train using 16 frames per video (aggregated to 1 frame), but increase the number of input frames to 64
during supervised finetuning. The video aggregator and cross attention layers have 0.6B and 4.6B parameters
for Llama 3 7B and 70B, respectively.
7.3 ModelScaling
After the visual-recognition components are added to Llama 3, the model contains self-attention layers, cross-
attention layers, and a ViT image encoder. To train adapters for the smaller 8B and 70B parameter models,
we found a combination of data and tensor parallelization is the most efficient. Model or pipeline parallelism
does not increase efficiency at these scales because the gathering of model parameters would dominate the
computation. We do, however, use pipeline parallelism (in addition to data and tensor parallelism) when
training the adapter for the 405B parameter model. Training at this scale introduces three new challenges in
addition to those outlined in Section 3.3: model heterogeneity, data heterogeneity, and numerical instabilities.
The model computation is heterogeneous because more computation is performed on
Modelheterogeneity.
some tokens than on others. In particular, image tokens are processed by the image encoder and the cross-
attention layers, whereas text tokens are only processed by the language backbone. This heterogeneity leads
to bottlenecks in the scheduling of pipeline parallelism. We address this problem by ensuring each pipeline
stage contains five layers: namely, four self-attention layers in the language backbone and a cross-attention
layer. (Recall that we introduce a cross-attention layer after every fourth self-attention layer.) In addition, we
replicate the image encoder on all pipeline stages. Because we train on paired image-text data, this enables us
to perform load balancing between the image and text parts of the computation.
57The data is heterogeneous because, on average, images have more tokens than the
Dataheterogeneity.
associated text: an image has 2,308 tokens, whereas the associated text contains an average of only 192 tokens.
As a result, the computation of cross-attention layers requires more time and memory than the computation
of self-attention layers. We address this problem by introducing sequence parallelization in the image encoder,
so that each GPU processes roughly the same number of tokens. Because the average text size is relatively
short, we also use a substantially larger micro-batch size (8 instead of 1).
After the image encoder is added to the model, we find that performing gradient

accumulation in bf16 led to numerical instabilities. The most likely explanation for this is that image tokens
areintroducedintothelanguagebackboneviaall cross-attentionlayers. Thisimpliesthatnumericaldeviations
in the representation of an image token have an outsized impact on the overall computation because the errors
are compounded. We address this by performing gradient accumulation in FP32.
7.4 Pre-training

unfrozen, while the text model weights are kept frozen as explained above. First, we train the model using 6B
image-text pairs where each image is resized to fit within four tiles of 336×336 pixels. We use a global batch
size of 16,384 and a cosine learning rate schedule with initial learning rate 10×10−4 and a weight decay of
0.01. The initial learning rate was determined based on small-scale experiments. However, these findings did
not generalize well to very long training schedules and dropped the learning rate a few times during training
when the loss values became stagnant. After the base pre-training, we increase the image resolution further
and continue training the same weights on the annealing dataset. The optimizer is re-initialized via warm-up
to learning rate 2×10−5 and again follows a cosine schedule.

and represent each frame using four chunks, each of size of 448×448 pixels. We use an aggregation factor of
16 in the video aggregator, hence obtaining one effective frame, which the text tokens cross-attend to. We use
a global batch size of 4,096, a sequence length of 190 tokens, and a learning rate of 10−4 during training.

model on highly curated multi-modal conversational data to enable chat capabilities. We further implement
direct preference optimization (DPO) to boost human evaluation performance and rejection sampling to
improve multi-modal reasoning capabilities. Finally, we add a quality-tuning stage where we continue fine-

while retaining performance across benchmarks. More details on each of these steps are provided below.
7.5.1 SupervisedFinetuningData
We describe our supervised finetuning (SFT) data for image and video capabilities separately below.
We utilize a mix of different datasets for supervised finetuning.

tasks (open-ended question-answering, captioning, practical use cases, etc.) and domains (e.g., natural
images and structured images). Annotators are provided with images and asked to write conversations.
Toensurediversity,weclusterlarge-scaledatasetsandsampledimagesuniformlyacrossdifferentclusters.
Further, we acquire additional images for a few specific domains by expanding a seed via k-nearest
58neighbors. Annotators are also provided with intermediate checkpoints of existing models to facilitate
model-in-the-loop style annotations, so that model generations can be utilized as a starting point by
the annotators to then provide additional human edits. This is an iterative process, in which model
checkpoints would be regularly updated with better performing versions trained on the latest data. This
increases the volume and efficiency of human annotations, while also improving their quality.
• We explore different ways to generate synthetic multi-modal data by using text-

representations of images and a text-input LLM. The high-level idea is to utilize the reasoning capa-
bilities of text-input LLMs to generate question-answer pairs in the text domain, and replace the text
representation with its corresponding images to produce synthetic multi-modal data. Examples include
rendering texts from question-answer datasets as images or rendering table data into synthetic images of
tables and charts. Additionally, we use captions and OCR extractions from existing images to generate
additional conversational or question-answer data related to the images.
Similartotheimageadapter, weuseacademicdatasetswithpre-existingannotationsandconvertthem

into appropriate textual instructions and target responses. The targets are converted to open-ended responses
or multiple-choice options, whichever is more appropriate. We ask humans to annotate videos with questions
and corresponding answers. The annotators are asked to focus on questions that could not be answered based
on a single frame, to steer the annotators towards questions that require temporal understanding.
7.5.2 SupervisedFinetuningRecipe
We describe our supervised finetuning (SFT) recipe for image and video capabilities separately below.
We initialize from the pre-trained image adapter, but hot-swap the pre-trained language model’s

weights with the instruction tuned language model’s weights. The language model weights are kept frozen to
maintain text-only performance, i.e., we only update the vision encoder and image adapter weights.
Our approach to finetune the model is similar to Wortsman et al. (2022). First, we run a hyperparameter
sweep using multiple random subsets of data, learning rates and weight decay values. Next, we rank the
models based on their performance. Finally, we average the weights of the top-K models to obtain the final
model. The value of K is determined by evaluating the averaged models and selecting the instance with
highest performance. We observe that the averaged models consistently yield better results compared to the
best individual model found via grid search. Further, this strategy reduces sensitivity to hyperparameters.
For video SFT, we initialize the video aggregator and cross-attention layers using the pre-trained

weights. The rest of the parameters in the model, the image weights and the LLM, are initialized from
corresponding models following their finetuning stages. Similar to video pre-training, we then finetune only
the video parameters on the video SFT data. For this stage, we increase the video length to 64 frames, and
use an aggregation factor of 32 to get two effective frames. The resolution of the chunks is also increased to
be consistent with the corresponding image hyperparameters.
7.5.3 PreferenceData
We built multimodal pair-wise preference datasets for reward modeling and direct preference optimization.
• The human-annotated preference data consists of comparisons between two different

model outputs, labeled as “chosen” and “rejected”, with 7-scale ratings. The models used to generate

We update the model pool weekly. Besides preference labels, we also request annotators to provide
optional human edits to correct inaccuracies in “chosen” responses because vision tasks have a low
tolerance for inaccuracies. Note that human editing is an optional step because there is a trade-off
between volume and quality in practice.
• Synthetic preference pairs could also be generated by using text-only LLMs to edit and

59• Rejectionsampling. Furthermore, to create more on-policy negative samples, we leveraged the iterative
process of rejection sampling to collect additional preference data. We discuss our usage of rejection
samplinginmoredetailinthefollowingsections. Atahigh-level,rejectionsamplingisusedtoiteratively
sample high-quality generations from a model. Therefore, as a by-product, all generations that are not
selected can be used as negative rejected samples and used as additional preference data pairs.
7.5.4 RewardModeling
We train a vision reward model (RM) on top of the vision SFT model and the language RM. The vision
encoder and the cross-attention layers are initialized from the vision SFT model and unfrozen during training,
while the self-attention layers are initialized from the language RM and kept frozen. We observe that freezing
the language RM part generally leads to better accuracy, especially on tasks that require the RM to judge
based on its knowledge or the language quality. We adopt the same training objective as the language RM,
but adding a weighted regularization term on the square of the reward logits averaged over the batch, which
prevents the reward scores from drifting.
The human preference annotations in Section 7.5.3 are used to train the vision RM. We follow the same
practice as language preference data (Section 4.2.1) to create two or three pairs with clear ranking (edited
> chosen > rejected). In addition, we also synthetically augment the negative responses by perturbing the
words or phrases related to the information in the image (such as numbers or visual texts). This encourages
the vision RM to ground its judgement based on the actual image content.
7.5.5 DirectPreferenceOptimization
Similar to the language model (Section 4.1.4), we further train the vision adapters with Direct Preference
Optimization(DPO;Rafailovetal.(2023))usingthepreferencedatadescribedinSection7.5.3. Tocombatthe
distribution shift during post-training rounds, we only keep recent batches of human preference annotations
while dropping batches that are sufficiently off-policy (e.g., if the base pre-trained model is changed). We find
that instead of always freezing the reference model, updating it in an exponential moving average (EMA)
fashion every k-steps helps the model learn more from the data, resulting in better performance in human
evaluations. Overall, we observed that the vision DPO model consistently performs better than its SFT
starting point in human evaluations for every finetuning iteration.
7.5.6 RejectionSampling
Most available question-answer pairs only contain the final answer and lack the chain-of-thought explanation
that is required to train a model that generalizes well for reasoning tasks. We use rejection sampling to
generate the missing explanations for such examples and boost the model’s reasoning capabilities.
Given a question-answer pair, we generate multiple answers by sampling the finetuned model with different
system prompts or temperature. Next, we compare the generated answers to the ground-truth via heuristics
or an LLM judge. Finally, we retrain the model by adding the correct answers back into the finetuning data
mix. We find it useful to keep multiple correct answers per question.
To ensure we only add high-quality examples back into training, we implemented the following two guardrails.
First, we find that some examples contain incorrect explanations, despite the final answer being correct. We
observed that this pattern occurs more frequently for questions where only a small fraction of the generated
answers is correct. Therefore, we drop answers for questions where the probability of the answer being correct
is below a certain threshold. Second, raters prefer some answers over others due to differences in language or
style. We use the reward model to select top-K highest-quality answers and add them back into training.
7.5.7 QualityTuning
We curate a small but highly selective SFT dataset where all samples have been rewritten and verified either

to ensure capabilities are retained or improved.
7.6 ImageRecognitionResults
We evaluate the performance of the image understanding capabilities of Llama 3 on a range of tasks spanning
natural image understanding, text understanding, charts understanding and multimodal reasoning:
• (Yue et al., 2024a) is a challenging dataset for mulitmodal reasoning where model is expected to

being slightly behind Gemini 1.5 Pro and Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Llama 3 405B appears particularly competitive
on document understanding tasks.

We evaluate our video adapter for Llama 3 on three benchmarks:

• (Xiao et al., 2021) is another temporal and causal reasoning benchmark, with a focus on
NExT-QA
open-ended question answering. It consists of 1K test videos each on-average 44s in length, paired with
9K questions. The evaluation is performed by comparing the model’s responses with the ground truth

It consists of over 15K validation QA pairs, with each corresponding video clip being on-average 76s
in length. It also follows a multiple-choice format with five options for each question, and we report
performance on the validation set following prior work (OpenAI, 2023b).

actions, spatial relations, temporal relations, counting, etc. It consists of 8K test QA pairs from 800
videos, each on-average 3 minutes long. For evaluation, we follow the protocol from prior work (Google,
2023; Lin et al., 2023; Maaz et al., 2024), where the model generates short one-word or one-phrase
answers, and the correctness of the output is evaluated using the GPT-3.5 API which compares it to
the ground truth answer. We report the average accuracy as evaluated by the API.
Whenperforminginference,weuniformlysampleframesfromthefullvideoclipandpassthoseframesintothe
model with a short text prompt. Since most of our benchmarks involve answering multiple-choice questions,
we use the following prompt: Select the correct answer from the following options: {question}. Answer
with the correct option letter and nothing else. Forbenchmarksthatrequireproducingashortanswer(e.g.,
ActivityNet-QA and NExT-QA), we use the following prompt: Answer the question using a single word
or phrase. {question}. For NExT-QA, since the evaluation metric (WUPS) is sensitive to the length and
the specific words used, we additionally prompt the model to be specific and respond with the most salient
answer, for instance specifying “living room” instead of simply responding with “house” when asked a location
question. For benchmarks that contain subtitles (i.e., TVQA), we include the subtitles corresponding to the
clip in the prompt during inference.
We present the performance of Llama 3 8B and 70B in Table 30. We compare Llama 3’s performance with
that of two Gemini and two GPT-4 models. Note that all our results are zero-shot, as we do not include
any part of these benchmarks in our training or finetuning data. We find that our Llama 3 models that
train a small video adapter during post-training are very competitive, and in some cases even better, than
other models that potentially leverage native multimodal processing all the way from pre-training. Llama 3
performs particularly well on video recognition given that we only evaluate the 8B and 70B parameter models.
Llama 3 achieves its best performance on PerceptionTest, suggesting the model has a strong ability to perform
complex temporal reasoning. On long-form activity understanding tasks like ActivityNet-QA, Llama 3 is able
to obtain strong results even though it is processing only up to 64 frames, which means that for a 3-minute
long video the model only processes one frame every 3 seconds.

8 SpeechExperiments
We perform experiments to study a compositional approach of integrating speech capabilities into Llama
3, resembling the method we used for visual recognition. On the input side, an encoder, together with an
adapter, is incorporated to process speech signals. We leverage a system prompt (in text) to enable different
modes of operation for speech understanding in Llama 3. If no system prompt is provided, the model acts as
a general-purpose spoken dialogue model which can effectively respond to the user speech in a manner that is
consistent with the text-only version of Llama 3. The dialogue history is introduced as the prompt prefix to
improve the multi-round dialogue experience. We also experiment with system prompts that enable the use
of Llama 3 for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and automatic speech translation (AST). The speech
interface of Llama 3 supports up to 34 languages.18 It also allows for the interleaved input of text and speech,
enabling the model to solve advanced audio-comprehension tasks.
We also experiment with a speech generation approach in which we implement a streaming text-to-speech
(TTS) system that generates speech waveforms on-the-fly during language model decoding. We design the
speech generator for Llama 3 based on a proprietary TTS system and do not fine-tune the language model for
speech generation. Instead, we focus on improving speech synthesis latency, accuracy, and naturalness by
leveraging Llama 3 embeddings at inference time. The speech interface is illustrated in Figure 28 and 29.

The training data can be categorized into two types. The pre-training data includes a large amount of

finetuning data includes speech recognition, speech translation, and spoken dialogue data; this data is used to
unlock specific abilities when integrated with the large language model.

63for speech prompts by asking the language model to respond to transcriptions of those prompts (Fathullah
et al., 2024). We generate synthetic data this way using a subset of the ASR dataset with 60K hours of speech.
In addition, we generate 25K hours of synthetic data by running the Voicebox TTS system (Le et al., 2024)
on subsets of the data used to finetune Llama 3. We used several heuristics to select a subset of finetuning
data that matches the distribution of speech. These heuristics include focusing on relatively short prompts
with a simple structure and without non-text symbols.
8.1.2 SpeechGeneration
The speech generation datasets mainly consist of those for training the text normalization (TN) model and
the prosody model (PM). Both training data are augmented with an additional input feature of the Llama 3
embeddings to provide contextual information.
Our TN training dataset includes 55K samples that cover a wide range of semiotic

exclusively with the Llama 3 8B model and extract the embeddings for a given text (i.e. written-form input
text for TN or the audio transcript for PM) as if they are generated by the Llama 3 model with an empty
user prompt. In a given sample, each chunk in the Llama 3 token sequence is explicitly aligned with the
corresponding chunks in native input sequence for TN or PM, i.e., TN-specific text tokens (demarcated by
unicode category) or phone-rate features respectively. This allows for training the TN and PM modules with
streaming input of Llama 3 tokens and embeddings.
8.2 ModelArchitecture
8.2.1 SpeechUnderstanding
On the input side, the speech module consists of two successive modules: a speech encoder and an adapter.
The output of the speech module is directly fed into the language model as token representation, enabling
direct interaction between speech and text tokens. Furthermore, we incorporate two new special tokens
to enclose the sequence of speech representations. The speech module differs substantially from the vision
module (see Section 7), which feeds multi-modal information into the language model via cross-attention
layers. By contrast, the speech module generates embeddings that can be seamlessly integrated with text
tokens, enabling the speech interface to leverage all the capabilities of the Llama 3 language model.
Our speech encoder is a Conformer (Gulati et al., 2020) model with 1B parameters. The
Speechencoder.
input to the model consists of 80-dimensional mel-spectrogram features, which are first processed by a stride-4
stacking layer followed by a linear projection to reduce the frame length to 40 ms. The resulting features are
processed by an encoder with 24 Conformer layers. Each Conformer layer has a latent dimension of 1536,
and consists of two Macron-net style feed-forward networks with dimension 4096, a convolution module with
kernel size 7, and a rotary attention module (Su et al., 2024) with 24 attention heads.
The speech adapter contains about 100M parameters. It is composed of a convolution layer,
Speechadapter.
a rotary Transformer layer, and a linear layer. The convolution layer has a kernel size of 3 and a stride of
2, which is designed to reduce the speech frame length to 80ms. This allows the model to provide more
coarse-grained features to the language model. The Transformer layer has a latent dimension of 3072 and a
feed-forward network with a dimension of 4096 which further processes the information from speech with
context after the convolutional downsampling. Finally, the linear layer maps the output dimension to match
that of the language-model embedding layer.
648.2.2 SpeechGeneration
We use Llama 3 8B embeddings in two key components for speech generation: Text Normalization and
Prosody Modeling. The TN module ensures semantic correctness by contextually transforming written text
into spoken form. The PM module enhances naturalness and expressiveness by predicting prosodic features
using these embeddings. Together, they enable accurate and natural speech generation.
As a determinant of the semantic correctness of generated speech, the text normalization
Textnormalization.
(TN) module carries out context-aware transformation from written-form text into the respective spoken form
which is eventually verbalized by the downstream components. For example, the written-form text 123 is
read as a cardinal number (one hundred twenty three) or spelled digit-by-digit (one two three) depending
on the semantic context. The TN system consists of a streaming LSTM-based sequence-tagging model that
predicts the sequence of handcrafted TN rules used to transform the input text (Kang et al., 2024). The
neural model also takes in Llama 3 embeddings via cross attention to leverage the contextual information
encoded therein, enabling minimal text token lookahead and streaming input/output.
To enhance the naturalness and expressiveness of synthesized speech, we integrate a
Prosodymodeling.
decoder-onlyTransformer-basedProsodymodel(PM)(Radfordetal.,2021)thattakestheLlama3embeddings
as an additional input. This integration leverages the linguistic capabilities of Llama 3, utilizing both its
textual output and intermediate embeddings at the token rate (Devlin et al., 2018; Dong et al., 2019; Raffel
et al., 2020; Guo et al., 2023) to enhance the prediction of prosody features, thus reducing the lookahead
required by the model.
ThePMintegratesseveralinputcomponentstogeneratecomprehensiveprosodypredictions: linguisticfeatures
derived from the text normalization front-end detailed above, tokens, and embeddings. The PM predicts three
key prosodic features: log duration of each phone, log F0 (fundamental frequency) average, and log power
average across the phone duration. The model comprises a uni-directional Transformer and six attention
heads. Each block includes cross-attention layers and dual fully connected layers with a hidden dimension
of 864. A distinctive feature of the PM is its dual cross-attention mechanism, with one layer dedicated to
linguistic inputs and the other to Llama embeddings. This setup efficiently manages varying input rates
without requiring explicit alignment.
8.3 TrainingRecipe
8.3.1 SpeechUnderstanding
Training of the speech module is done in two stages. The first stage, speech pre-training, leverages unlabeled
data to train a speech encoder that exhibits strong generalization capabilities across languages and acoustic
conditions. In the second stage, supervised fine-tuning, the adapter and pre-trained encoder are integrated
with the language model, and trained jointly with it while the LLM stays frozen. This enables the model to
respond to speech input. This stage uses labeled data corresponding to speech understanding abilities.
MultilingualASRandASTmodelingoftenresultsinlanguageconfusion/interference, whichleadstodegraded
performance. A popular way to mitigate this is to incorporate language identification (LID) information,
both on the source and target side. This can lead to improved performance in the predetermined set of
directions, but it does come with potential loss of generality. For instance, if a translation system expects
LID on both source and target side, then the model will not likely to show good zero-shot performance in
directions that were not seen in training. So our challenge is to design a system that allows LID information
to some extent, but keeps the model general enough such that we can have the model do speech translation
in unseen directions. To address this, we design system prompts which only contain LID for the text to be
emitted (target side). There is no LID information for the speech input (source side) in these prompts, which
also potentially allows it to work with code-switched speech. For ASR, we use the following system prompt:
Repeat after me in {language}:, where {language} comes from one of the 34 languages (English, French,
etc.) For speech translation, the system prompt is: Translate the following sentence into {language}:. This
design has been shown to be effective in prompting the language model to respond in the desired language.
We used the same system prompts during training and inference.
We use the self-supervised BEST-RQ algorithm (Chiu et al., 2022) to pre-train the speech

65encoder. We apply a mask of 32-frame length with a probability of 2.5% to the input mel-spectrogram. If the
speech utterances are longer than 60 seconds, we perform a random crop of 6K frames, corresponding to 60
seconds of speech. We quantize mel-spectrogram features by stacking 4 consecutive frames, projecting the
320-dimensional vectors to a 16-dimensional space, and performing a nearest-neighbor search with respect to
cosine similarity metric within a codebook of 8,192 vectors. To stabilize pre-training, we employ 16 different
codebooks. The projection matrix and codebooks are randomly initialized and are not updated throughout
the model training. The multi-softmax loss is used only on masked frames for efficiency reasons. The encoder
is trained for 500K steps with a global batch size of 2,048 utterances.

jointly optimized with Llama 3 in the supervised finetuning stage. The language model remains unchanged
during this process. The training data is a mixture of ASR, AST, and spoken dialogue data. The speech
model for Llama 3 8B is trained for 650K updates, using a global batch size of 512 utterances and an initial
learning rate of 10−4. The speech model for Llama 3 70B is trained for 600K updates, using a global batch
size of 768 utterances and an initial learning rate of 4×10−5.
8.3.2 SpeechGeneration
To support real-time processing, the prosody model employs a lookahead mechanism that considers a fixed
number of future phones and a variable number of future tokens. This ensures consistent lookahead while
processing incoming text, which is crucial for low-latency speech synthesis applications.
We develop a dynamic alignment strategy utilizing causal masking to facilitate streamability in

variable number of future tokens, aligning with the chunking process during text normalization (Section 8.1.2).
For each phone, the token lookahead includes the maximum number of tokens defined by the chunk size,
resulting in variable lookahead for Llama embeddings but fixed lookahead for phonemes.
The Llama 3 embeddings are sourced from the Llama 3 8B model, which remains frozen during the training
of the Prosody Model. The input phone-rate features include both linguistic and speaker/style controllability
elements. The model training is conducted with a batch size of 1,024 utterances, each with a maximum length
of 500 phones. We employ a learning rate of 9×10−4 using the AdamW optimizer, training over 1 million
updates with a learning rate warmup for the first 3,000 updates, following a cosine schedule.
During inference, the same lookahead mechanism and causal masking strategy are employed to

ensure consistency between training and real-time processing. The PM handles incoming text in a streaming
manner, updating the input phone by phone for phone-rate features and chunk by chunk for token-rate
features. The new chunk input is updated only when the first phone for that chunk is current, maintaining
the alignment and lookahead as during training.

the results with Gemini 1.5 Pro. We evaluate the percentage of added toxicity (AT), when the input prompt
is safe and the output is toxic, and the percentage of lost toxicity (LT), when the input prompt is toxic and
the answer is safe. Table 33 shows the results for English and an average across all 21 languages that we
evaluated on.22 The percentage of added toxicity is very low: our speech models have the lowest percentage
of added toxicity for English, with less than 1%. It removes significantly more toxicity than it adds.

responsive and real-time speech synthesis compared to non-streaming baselines. Overall, the Llama 3 8B
prosody model consistently outperforms the baseline models, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the
naturalness and expressiveness of synthesized speech.
9 RelatedWork
The development of Llama 3 builds on a large body of prior work studying foundation models for language,
images, videos, and speech. A comprehensive overview of that work is outside the scope of this paper; we
refer the reader to Bordes et al. (2024); Madan et al. (2024); Zhao et al. (2023a) for such overviews. Below,
we briefly outline seminal works that directly influenced the development of Llama 3.

our largest Llama 3 in fact contains fewer parameters than earlier and much less performant models such as
PALM (Chowdhery et al., 2023), due to better understanding of scaling laws (Kaplan et al., 2020; Hoffmann
et al., 2022). Little is publicly known about the size of other frontier models, such as Claude 3 or GPT
4 (OpenAI, 2023a), but overall performance is compareable.

parameters can dramatically improve inference cost and simplify deployment (Mehta et al., 2024; Team et al.,
2024). The smaller Llama 3 models achieve this by training far beyond the point of compute optimal training,
effectively trading training compute for inference efficiency. An alternative path is to distill larger models into
smaller ones, as in Phi (Abdin et al., 2024).
While Llama 3 makes minimal architectural modifiations to compared to Llama 2, other recent

foundation models have explored other designs. Most notably, mixture of experts architectures (Shazeer et al.,

the capacity of a models, such as in Mixtral (Jiang et al., 2024) and Arctic (Snowflake, 2024). Llama 3
outperforms these models, suggesting that dense architectures are not the limiting factor, but there remain
numerous trade offs in terms of training and inference efficiency, and model stability at scale.

developed, including Mistral (Jiang et al., 2023), Falcon (Almazrouei et al., 2023), MPT (Databricks, 2024),
Pythia (Biderman et al., 2023), Arctic (Snowflake, 2024), OpenELM (Mehta et al., 2024), OLMo (Groeneveld

Gemma (Team et al., 2024), Grok (XAI, 2024), and Phi (Abdin et al., 2024).
Post-training Llama 3 follows the established strategy of instruction tuning (Chung et al., 2022;

Ouyang et al., 2022) followed by alignment with human feedback (Kaufmann et al., 2023). While some studies
have shown the surprising effectiveness of lightweight alignment procedures (Zhou et al., 2024), Llama 3
uses millions of human instructions and preference judgments to improve the pre-trained model, including
69techniques such as rejection sampling (Bai et al., 2022), supervised finetuning (Sanh et al., 2022), and Direct
Preference Optimization (Rafailov et al., 2023). In order to curate these instruction and preference examples,
we deploy earlier versions of Llama 3 to filter (Liu et al., 2024c), re-write (Pan et al., 2024), or generate

pairs, for example, Mahajan et al. (2018); Xiao et al. (2024a); Team (2024); OpenAI (2023b). Radford et al.
(2021) presented one of the first models to jointly embed images and text via contrastive learning. More
recently, a series of models has studied approaches similar to the one used in Llama 3, for example, Alayrac
et al. (2022); Dai et al. (2023); Liu et al. (2023c,b); Yang et al. (2023b); Ye et al. (2023); Zhu et al. (2023).
Our approach in Llama 3 combines ideas from many of these papers to achieve results that are comparable
with Gemini 1.0 Ultra (Google, 2023) and GPT-4 Vision (OpenAI, 2023b); see Section 7.6.
Although video inputs are supported by an increasing number of foundation models (Google, 2023;
Video.
OpenAI, 2023b), the body of work on joint modeling of videos and language is not that large. Akin to Llama
3, most current studies adopt an adapter approach to align video and language representations and unlock
question-answering and reasoning about videos (Lin et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023a; Maaz et al., 2024; Zhang
et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2022). We find that such approaches produce results that are competitive with the
state-of-the-art; see Section 7.7.
Our work also fits in a larger body of work combining language and speech modeling. Earlier joint

on prior compositional approaches to combining speech and language like Fathullah et al. (2024). Unlike
most prior work, we opt to not finetune the language model itself for speech tasks as doing so may lead to
contention on non-speech tasks. We find that at larger model scales, strong performances are attainable even
without such finetuning; see Section 8.4.
10 Conclusion
In many ways, the development of high-quality foundation models is still in its infancy. Our experience
in developing Llama 3 suggests that substantial further improvements of these models are on the horizon.
Throughout the development of the Llama 3 model family, we found that a strong focus on high-quality data,
scale, and simplicity consistently yielded the best results. In preliminary experiments, we explored more
complex model architectures and training recipes but did not find the benefits of such approaches to outweigh
the additional complexity they introduce in model development.
Developing a flagship foundation model such as Llama 3 involves overcoming a plethora of deep technical
problems but also requires clever organizational decisions. For example, to ensure Llama 3 is not accidentally
overfittedoncommonlyusedbenchmarks,ourpre-trainingdatawasprocuredandprocessedbyaseparateteam
that was strongly incentivized to prevent contamination of that pre-training data with external benchmarks.
As another example, we ensure that our human evaluations remain trustworthy by allowing only a small set
of researchers who do not contribute to model development to perform and access these evaluations. While
such organizational decisions are rarely discussed in technical papers, we found them to be pivotal to the
successful development of the Llama 3 family of models.
We shared the details of our development process because we believe this will: help the larger research

(2)
debate about the future of foundation models in the general public. We also shared preliminary experiments
with integrating multimodal capabilities into Llama 3. While these models are still under active development
and not yet ready for release, we hope sharing our results early will accelerate research in this direction.
70Following the positive outcomes of the detailed safety analyses presented in this paper, we publicly release our
Llama 3 language models in order to accelerate the development of AI systems for a plethora of societally
relevant use cases and enable the research community to scrutinize our models and identify ways to make
these models better and safer. We believe that the public release of foundation models plays a key role in the
responsible development of such models, and we hope that the release of Llama 3 encourages the industry to
embrace the open, responsible development of AGI.
