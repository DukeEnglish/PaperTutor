1. Introduction
In 1934, H. Whitney introduced the problem of extending a function f on a
set of points in Rn to an analytic function on the ambient space. In the 2000s,
C. Fefferman took up Whitney’s work and proved a sharp form of the Whitney
extension theorem [5]. In particular, if the set of points in Euclidean space is finite
of cardinality n, there is an extension which is continuously differentiable of some
degree depending on n.
In this paper, we study a version of Whitney’s extension problem where the
points have an inherent symmetry. More precisely, we consider points x(i) in a
symmetric homogeneous space X = G/H for reductive Lie groups G,H and a
nonconstant function f on these points with values f(x(i)) = y(i) in the complex
numbers C. We are especially interested not just in proving existence of an ana-
lytic function extending f, but to obtain a formula for this function which can be
effectively computed by an algorithm. Initially, we weaken the assumption
f(x(i))=y(i), 1⩽i⩽n.
Instead, we find for all ε>0 a complex valued function f :X →C so that
n
|f (x(i))−y(i)|<ε, 1⩽i⩽n.
n
Observe that the function f depends on ε.
n
Furthermore, we show how to modify the proof to obtain an exact Whitney
extension theorem. The function f generates a representation Π of G, which we
n n
call the Whitney representation of the data. By acting with the maximal compact
subgroup K in G, we modify the Whitney function without changing the K-types
occuring in its Whitney representation to obtain an analytic, square integrable
function, still denoted f , such that f (x(i))=y(i) for all i⩽n.

Theorem 1.1. Let p ⩾ 2. Let x(i), 1 ⩽ i ⩽ n, be a set of points in X(p,2) and
−
let f(x(i)) = y(i) be a nonconstant, complex-valued function. For all ε > 0, there
exists an analytic, square integrable function f :X(p,2) →C such that
n −
|f (x(i))−y(i)|<ε.
n
We call f the Whitney function of the data points.
n
We approach the extension problem by realizing space X(p,2) as the homoge-
−
neous space
X(p,2) =SO(p,2)◦/SO(p,1)◦.
−
This allows us to obtain an explicit formula for the Whitney function f using
n
the representation theory of noncompact Lie groups. In particular, we build on
the work of M. Flensted-Jensen [8], who published in 1980 an article in which he
constructs a family of square integrable functions on symmetric spaces which are
eigenfunctions of all invariant differential operators. We refer to these functions as
Flensted-Jensen functions.
Theorem 1.2. Let x(i), 1⩽i⩽n, be a set of points in X(p,2) and let f(x(i))=

y(i) be a nonconstant complex-valued function. In the notation of Theorem 1.1, the
Whitney function f can be chosen as a C-linear combination of Flensted-Jensen

1.2. Related work. In the 2000s, C. Fefferman proved a sharp form of the Whit-
ney extension theorem [5]. In particular, if the set of points in Euclidean space is
finite of cardinality n, he showed that there is an extension which is continously
differentiable of some degree depending on n. In this paper we start with a set of
points of finite cardinality n, and using additional assumptions we prove the exis-
tence of a Whitney function which is infinitely often differentiable. The reason we
areabletogetanextensionofsuchhighregularityisthatwetakeadvantageofthe
fact that the points live in a subset of Euclidean space obeying a high amount of
symmetries.
C. Fefferman et al. [7] have also studied Whitney extension problems in sit-
uations where the points live on a smooth manifold X. The Whitney extension
theorems proved in that context, however, are existence theorems. In contrast,
the results given in this article are effective. We give an algorithm computing the
extension with an explicit formula. This is possible because we build the exten-
sion from functions in the discrete spectrum of the symmetric space G/H. Such
Flensted-Jensen functions are solutions to a system of differential equations and
hence satisfy a high amount symmetries.
Whitney extension theorems have found a range of applications in data science
[6]. There is a growing literature on equivariant machine learning, where the data
are invariant with respect to a group of symmetries [2]. Most results in this direc-
tion, however, are only available when the symmetry group of the points is either
finite or a compact Lie group [2], [17], [4]. However, many groups of importance in
physics are noncompact, such as the Lorentz group SO(3,1)◦, the symmetry group
SO(p,1)◦ of X(p,1) , and the symmetry group SO(p,2)◦ of X(p,2) . One moti-
± ±
vation for this work is to generalize the results in harmonic analysis applicable to
Lie group equivariant machine learning to include noncompact Lie groups.
1.3. Contents. The paper has four parts. In this section, we summarize the con-
tents of each part.WHITNEY EXTENSION THEOREMS ON SYMMETRIC SPACES, AN EXAMPLE. 5
1.3.1. Data on a sphere. In the first part, we prove Whitney extension theorems
for points on a sphere S2 in R3, whose group of symmetries is the compact group
SO(3). The proof is instructive for the noncompact case, so we give it in details.
To do so, we use spherical harmonics, which will be used in the later parts of the
article as well. Indeed, spherical harmonics also play a role in the representation
theory of non compact roups and semisimple symmetric spaces, since Flensted-
Jensen functions can be written as products of a Jacobi polynomial, which is the
restriction of a harmonic polynomial, with a hyperbolic function.

away. Notice that in this case, we do not need the points to lie in a symmetric
space; all we need is that they are contained in the complement of the unit disk, in
order to make certain functions square integrable. We include these results here to
illustrate our techniques.
The result we prove is as follows.
Theorem 1.4. Let x(i), 1 ⩽ i ⩽ n, be a set of points in the plane R2. Assume
x(i) is not contained in the unit disk, and consider a nonconstant complex-valued
function f(x(i)) = y(i). There exists an analytic, square integrable function on R2
with the closed unit disk removed which extends this function.
We prove this theorem by observing that it falls out, automatically, of the

1.3.3. Data on the symmetric space X(2,2) = SO(2,2)◦/SO(1,2)◦. This part
+
forms the core of the paper. We discuss the Whitney extension problem for the
three-dimensional manifold X(2,2) = SO(2,2)◦/SO(1,2)◦ . We are especially
+
interested not just in proving the existence, but also to obtain a formula for this
function which can be easily computed. More precisely, we consider the question:
Question1.1. Doesthereexistasmooth,squareintegrablefunctionf ∈C∞(X(2,2) )

such that f(x(i))=y(i) for all i⩽n? Can we we obtain a closed formula for f?
Note that the manifold is a fibration of Minkowski space over the circle, SO(2).

(3) We assume that the points are in general position, in the sense that they

of the ambient symmetric space (cf. 3.2).
Notonlydowefindasmooth, squareintegrablefunctionextendingthefunction

Theorem 1.5. Under these assumptions, for all ε > 0, there exists an analytic,
square integrable function f ∈C∞(X(2,2) ) such that
+
|f(x(i))−y(i)|<ε
for all i⩽n.
Under the above assumptions, we consider the representation of G generated
by f in the representation space L2(X(2,2) ). We show that to each Whitney
n +
function, we can associate a reducible, unitary representation, Π , which we call
n
the Whitney representation of the data.
We then consider the problem: If we enlarge the set of points from cardinal-
ity n to n + 1, can we choose a smooth, square integrable, K-finite function
f ∈ L2(X(2,2) ) such that f (x(i)) = y(i) for all i and such that Π is a
n+1 + n+1 n
subrepresentation of Π ? We give an analytic proof that we can always act on
n+1
the points by the maximal compact subgroup SO(2)×SO(2) to arrange that all
irreducible subrepresentations below some fixed degree will occur in the Whitney
representation.

our results extend to the symmetric spaces

2. Low dimensional examples
2.1. The sphere S2. In this subsection we consider a set of points
x(i) ∈S2 ={x∈R3 :x2+x2+x2 =1}, 1⩽i⩽n,
1 1 3
and a function f(x(i)) = y(i) (1 ⩽ i ⩽ n) which we assume is not constant. We
think of this as an observable set of data with an inherent spherical symmetry.
From this perspective, it is natural to assume
x(i) ∈Q3, y(i) ∈Q
for all i, and we will impose this assumption throughout this section. Our goal is

of SO(3).WHITNEY EXTENSION THEOREMS ON SYMMETRIC SPACES, AN EXAMPLE. 7
2.2. Preliminaries. There is a natural action of SO(3) on S2. We endow it with
the surface area measure, µ, which is invariant under the action of SO(3), and
normalizedsuchthatµ(S2)=1. WeconsidertheHilbertspaceL2(S2,µ)ofsquare
integrable functions with respect to µ. Then SO(3) acts on L2(S2) as
(g·ψ)(x)=ψ(g−1x), g ∈SO(3),ψ ∈L2(S2), x∈S2.
Let ∆=(cid:80)3 ∂2/∂x2 be the Laplacian on R3. Recall that a harmonic polynomial
i=1 i
on R3 is a polynomial p = p(x ,x ,x ) ∈ C[x ,x ,x ] in three variables with
1 2 3 1 2 3
complex coefficients satisfying
∆p=0.
Example: Let ℓ∈Z ⩾0. The polynomial

is a harmonic of degree ℓ. Note that p is independent of x and is holomorphic as

a function of the complex variable z =x + −1x . By [1, 4.3], it follows that p is

In particular, ∆p = 0. The space of spherical harmonics of degree ℓ (ℓ ∈ Z ⩾0) is
the subspace V of L2(S2) consisting of restrictions to S2 of harmonic polynomials

on R3 that are homogeneous of degree ℓ. Recall that the space V of spherical
ℓ
harmonics of degree ℓ is an irreducible representation of SO(3) of degree 2ℓ+1.
If V is any irreducible finite-dimensional representation of SO(3), then there is a
unique integer ℓ such that V is isomorphic to V . The space L2(S2) decomposes as

R3 with the product measure
µ⊗4πr2dr
of the surface area measure µ on S2 with the measure 4πr2dr on (0,∞). The
measure µ⊗4πr2dr is invariant with respect to the natural action of SO(3) on
R3, and we define L2(R3) with respect to this measure. Then L2(R3) is a unitary
representation of SO(3).
Lemma 2.1. There is a canonical isomorphism of L2(R3) with the Hilbert tensor

Lemma 3.2. Let so(2,2) be the Lie algebra of SO(2,2), and let so(2,2;C) be its
complexification. There is an isomorphism of Lie algebras

In particular, if g ≃sl(2,C), then
1
so(2,2;C)≃g ⊕g
1 1
and
so(2,2)≃sl(2;C)R.
Hence so(2,2) is simple as a real Lie algebra, while so(2,2;C) is not simple (but
semisimple.)
Proof. Let

Let M (R) be the space of 4×4 real matrices, and for any matrix X, let tX be its

transpose. We have g =g−1 and
so(2,2)≃{X ∈M (R):g(cid:0)tX(cid:1) g−1 =−X}.

tX =−X ⇐⇒

It follows that there is a Lie algebra isomorphism

By [10, Section 7.7.2 and 7.8 Exercise 4],
so(4;C)≃sl(2;C)⊕sl(2;C).
As in the proof of [10, Theorem 7.32], these two copies of sl(2;C) are complex
conjugate. If g denotes the first copy in the decomposition, then so(2,2,C) =

g ⊕g . The map φ:g →so(2,2;C)

φ:X (cid:55)→X+X

3.2. From rational data to Whitney functions. The first case. The func-

4. The higher dimensional symmetric spaces X (p,2)
±
In this section, we sketch the generalization of the Whitney extension theorems
to the higher dimensional symmetric spaces
X(p,2) =SO(p,2)◦/SO(p,1)◦ and X(p,2) =SO(p,2)◦/SO(p−1,2)◦.

4.1. Generalities. First,weclarifythedefinitionsofcertainsemisimplesymmetric
spaces that we will study in the sequel. We refer to [15, Section 2.5] for further
details. Define
X(p,q) ={(x,y)∈Rp+q :|x|2−|y|2 =1}
+
and
X(p,q) ={(x,y)∈Rp+q :|x|2−|y|2 =−1}.
−
There is a diffeomorphism
X(p,q) ≃X(q,p)
− +
given by (x,y)(cid:55)→(y,x). The Lie group G=SO(p,q)◦ acts transitively on X(p,q)
+
and on X(p,q) , and there are G-diffeomorphisms
−
X(p,q) ≃SO(p,q)◦/SO(p−1,q)◦,
+
and
X(p,q) ≃SO(p,q)◦/SO(p,q−1)◦.
−
In the remaining part of the paper, we will generalize our results from the space
X(2,2) to the spaces X(p,2) for all p ≥ 2. We keep q = 2 because we want
− −
the maximal compact subgroup K of the symmetry group SO(p,2)◦ to have an
abelian factor which is diffeomorphic to the circle group SO(2), so that our space
hasacomplexstructureandwecanspeakaboutholomorphicandantiholomorphic
discrete series representations.
Let p⩾2. Next, we parametrize the symmetric space
X(p,2) ={(x,y)∈Rp+2 :|x|2−|y|2 =−1}
−
in terms of hyperbolic coordinates. The lemma below, which gives the KJH-
decomposition of the symmetric space X(p,q) , motivates this reparametrization.

Lemma 4.1. Let p,q ⩾2 and let G=SO(p,q)◦. There is a decomposition
G=KJH,

4.1.1. Data points. Let G=SO(p,2)◦ and H =SO(p,1)◦. Recall that we say that
the points x(i) ∈G/H are in general position if not all points are contained in an
orbit G′/G′∩H in G/H of a proper reductive subgroup G′ of G isomorphic to one
of the orthogonal groups SO(p′,2)◦, SO(p′,1)◦, or SO(p′,0) for some p′ ⩽p.

Hermitian spacesadmit closed formulasinvolvingconsecutivepowers of hyperbolic
cosine, indexed by weights [21, Theorem 5.2], consistent with the formulas pre-
sented here. Consequently, our Whitney type extension theorems can be adapted
(at least) to Hermitian spaces whose symmetry group is SU(1,1).WHITNEY EXTENSION THEOREMS ON SYMMETRIC SPACES, AN EXAMPLE. 23
