Abstract—This paper presents the design of a time-division
multiplexed capacitively-coupled chopper analog front end with a
novel impedance boost loop (IBL) and a novel DC servo loop
(DSL). The proposed IBL boosts the input impedance of the analog
front end to up to several tens of GΩ. It firstly utilizes an external
IBL to prevent the total input impedance from degradation caused
by parasitic capacitance from the ESD pad and external
interconnections, and secondly relies on an internal IBL to
compensate for the leakage current introduced by the chopper.
The proposed DSL consists of a coarse DSL driven by square waveforms and a fine DSL driven by five phase-interleaving PWM
waveforms, which up modulate the harmonics 5 times higher. An
edge-pursuit comparator (EPC) is utilized to monitor the residual
electrode offset voltage (EDO) at the LNA’s output. Designed in a
0.18-μm CMOS process, the AFE consumes 4.5 μA from a 1.2-V
supply. The simulated input referred noise is 0.47 μVrms from 0.5
to 100 Hz in the presence of a 384-mV EDO. The proposed AFE
achieves a high input impedance of 83 GΩ at 1 Hz and 9.3 GΩ at
100 Hz even with the presence of 20-pF parasitic capacitance.
