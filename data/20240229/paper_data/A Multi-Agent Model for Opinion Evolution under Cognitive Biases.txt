Modeling these dynamics allows us to gain insights into how opinions form,
spread, and evolve within social networks.
The DeGroot multi-agent model [5] is one of most prominent formalisms
for opinion formation dynamics in social networks. Society is represented as a
directed graph whose edges indicate how much individuals (called agents) in-
fluence one another. Each agent has an opinion represented as a value in [0,1]
indicating the strength of their agreement with an underlying proposition (e.g.,
“vaccines are safe”). They repeatedly update their opinions with the weighted
average of their opinion differences (level of disagreement) with those who in-
fluence them. The DeGroot model is valued for its tractability, derived from its
connection with matrix powers and Markov chains, and it remains a significant
focus of study providing a comprehensive understanding of opinion evolution[6].
Nevertheless,theDeGrootmodelhasanimportantcaveat:Itassumeshomo-
geneity and linearity of opinion update. In social scenarios, however, two agents
may update their opinions differently depending on their individual cognitive
biases on disagreement—i.e., how they interpret and react towards the level of
disagreements with others. This results in more complex updates that may in-
volvenon-linearevennon-monotonicfunctions.Forexample,anindividualunder
confirmation (cognitive) bias [2] may ignore the opinion of those whose level of
disagreement with them is over a certain threshold. In fact, much of the unpre-
dictability in opinion formation is due to users’ biases in their belief updates,
where users sometimes tend to reinforce their original beliefs, instead of ques-
tioningandupdatingtheiropinionsuponencounteringnewinformation.Indeed,
rather than perfect rational agents, users are often subject to cognitive biases.
In an earlier FORTE paper [1], we introduced a DeGroot-like model with a
non-linear update mechanism tailored for a specific type of confirmation bias.
The model was shown to be tractable and it provides insights into the effect of
thiscognitivebiasinopiniondynamics.Nevertheless,italsoassumeshomogene-
ity of opinion update, and choosing a particular function to represent the bias,
although natural, may seem somewhat ad-hoc.
To address the above-mentioned caveat, in this paper we introduce a gen-
eralization of the DeGroot model that allows for heterogeneous and non-linear
opinionupdates.Eachagenthastheirownindividualcognitivebiasesonlevelsof
disagreement. These biases are represented as arbitrary functions in the square
region [−1,1]2. The model then unifies disparate belief update styles with bias
into a single framework which takes disagreement between agents as the central
parameter. Indeed, standard cognitive biases of great importance in social net-
works such as backfire effect [8], authority bias [9], and confirmation bias [2],
among others, can be represented in the framework.
We classify the biases in [−1,1]2 into four sub-regions (M,R,B,I) based on
the cognitive reactions they may cause in an agent during instances of opinion
disagreement. For example, agents that are malleable, easily swayed, exhibit
fanaticismorprompttofollowauthoritativefigurescanbemodelledwithbiases
in M. Agents that are receptive to other opinions, but unlike malleable ones,

in the region R. Individuals that become more extreme when confronted with
opposing opinions can be modelled by biases in B. Finally insular agents can be
modelled with the bias in I.
Consensus is a central property for opinion formation dynamics. Indeed the
inability to converge to consensus is often a sign of a polarized society. In this
paper we use the above-mentioned region classification to provide the following
insightful theoretical results for consensus.
– Assuming that each bias of every agent is a continuous function in R, the
society converges to a consensus if that society is strongly connected. This
implies that a strongly connected society can converge to a consensus if its
members are receptive but resistant to the opinions of others.
– Under the same assumption, we also establish that the entire society con-
verges to a unanimous opinion if and only if the source components of the
graph, i.e., strongly connected components with no external influence, con-
verge to that opinion. This implies that upon agreeing on an opinion, closed
and potentially influential groups, can make all individuals converge to that
opinion in a society whose members are receptive but resistant.
– We show that convergence is not guaranteed for strongly connected graphs
when biases are either discontinuous functions in R or not included in R.

2 An Opinion Model with Cognitive Biases
TheDeGrootmodel[5]isawell-knownmodelforsociallearning.Inthisformal-
ism each individual (agent) repeatedly updates their current opinion by averag-
ing the opinion values of those who influence them. But one of its limitation is
that the model does not provide a mechanism for capturing the cognitive biases
under which each individual may interpret and react to the opinion of others.
In this section we introduce a generalization of the DeGroot model with a
mechanism to express arbitrary cognitive bias based on opinion disagreement.
2.1 Influence Graph.
In social learning models, a community/society is typically represented as a
directed weighted graph with edges between individuals (agents) representing
the direction and strength of the influence that one carries over the other. This
graph is referred to as the Influence Graph.
Definition 1 (Influence Graph). An (n-agent) influence graph is a directed
weighted graph G = (A,E,I) with A = {1,...,n} the vertices, E ⊆ A×A the
edges, and I :A×A→[0,1] a weight function s.t. I(i,j)=0 iff (i,j)∈/ E.4 Alvim et al.
The vertices in A represent n agents of a given community or network. The
set of edges E ⊆A×A represents the (direct) influence relation between these
agents; i.e., (i,j) ∈ E means that agent i influences agent j. The value I(i,j),
for simplicity written I , denotes the strength of the influence: 0 means no
i,j
influence and a higher value means stronger influence. We use A to denote the
i
set {i | (j,i)∈E} of agents that have a direct influence over agent i.
Remark 1. In contrast to [1], we do not require agents to have nonzero self-
influence. Furthermore, since we do not require the sum of influences over a
givenagenttobe1(unlike[5]),wewillusethefollowingnotationforproportional
influence of j over i: I = Ij,i if (j,i)∈E, else I =0.

2.2 General Opinion Update.
Similar to the DeGroot-like models in [6], we model the evolution of agents’
opinions about some underlying statement or proposition. For example, such a
proposition could be “vaccines are unsafe,” “human activity has little impact on
climate change,”, “AI poses a threat to humanity”, or “Reviewer 2 is wonderful”.
Thestateofopinion (orbeliefstate)ofalltheagentsisrepresentedasavector
in [0,1]|A|. If B is a state of opinion, B ∈ [0,1] denotes the opinion (belief, or
i
agreement)valueofagenti∈Aregardingtheunderlyingproposition.IfB =0,
i
agent i completely disagrees with the underlying proposition; if B =1, agent i
i
completely agrees with the underlying proposition. Furthermore, the higher the
value of B , the stronger the agreement with such a proposition.
i
At each time unit t ∈ N, every agent i ∈ A updates their opinion. We shall
useBt todenotethestateofopinionattimet∈N.Wecannowdefineageneral
DeGroot-like opinion model as follows.
Definition 2 (Opinion Model). An Opinion Model is a tuple (G,B0,µ )
G
where G is an n-agent influence graph, B0 is the initial state of opinion, and
µ : [0,1]n → [0,1]n is a state-transition function, called update function. For
G
every t∈N, the state of opinion at time t+1 is given by Bt+1 =µ (Bt).
G
The update functions can be used to express any deterministic and discrete
transition from one opinion state to the next, possibly taking into account the
influence graph. This work singles out and characterizes a meaningful family of
update functions extending the basic DeGroot model with cognitive biases that
arebasedonopiniondisagreement.Intuitively,theseupdatefunctionsspecifythe
reaction of an agent to the opinion disagreements with each of their influencers.
Tobuildsomeintuition,wefirstrecalltheupdatefunctionoftheDeGrootmodel.
Below we omit the index from the update function µ if no confusion arises.

2.3 DeGroot Update
The standard DeGroot model [5] is obtained by the following update function:
(cid:88)
µ(B) = I B (1)
i j,i j
j∈AiA Multi-Agent Model for Opinion Evolution under Cognitive Biases 5
for every i ∈ A. Thus, in the DeGroot model each agent updates their opinion
by taking the weighted average of the opinions of those who influence them. We
can rewrite Eq.1 as follows:
(cid:88)
µ(B) =B + I (B −B ). (2)
i i j,i j i
j∈Ai
Notice that DeGroot update is linear in the agents’ opinions and can be
expressedintermsofdisagreement:Theopinionofeveryagentiisupdatedtak-
ing into account the weighted average of their opinion disagreement or opinion
difference with those who influence them.
Intuitively, if j influences i, then i’s opinion would tend to move closer to
j’s. The disagreement term (B −B ) ∈ [−1,1] in Eq.2 realizes this intuition.
j i
If (B −B ) is a negative term in the sum, the disagreement can be thought of
j i
as contributing with a magnitude of |B −B | (multiplied by I ) to decreasing
j i j,i
i’s belief in the underlying proposition. Similarly, if (B −B ) is positive, the
j i
disagreement contributes with the same magnitude but to increasing i’s belief.

Below we identify some particular examples of the cognitive biases that can
be captured with disagreement-bias opinion models.
Example 1 (SomeCognitiveBiases).Clearly,theclassicalDeGrootupdatefunc-
tion Eq.2 can be recovered from Eq.3 by letting every bias β be the identity
i,j
on disagreement: i.e., β =degroot where degroot(x)=x.
i,j
Confirmation Bias. We now illustrate some form of confirmation bias[2]
where agents are more receptive to opinions that are closer to theirs. An ex-
ample of confirmation bias can be obtained by letting β = conf(x) = x(1+
i,j
δ−|x|)/(1+δ) for a very small non-negative constant δ.6 In the following plots
and simulations we fix δ =1×10−4. This bias causes i to pay less attention to
the opinion of j as their opinion distance |x|=|B −B | tends to 1.
j i
Backfire Effect. Let us now consider another important cognitive bias called
backfire effect[8]. Under this effect an agent strengthens their position of dis-
agreement with another agent if their opinions are significantly distant. A form
ofbackfireeffectcanbeobtainedbylettingβ =backfwherebackf(x)=−x3.
i,j
NoticethatunliketheDeGrootupdate,thisbiascontributestochangingi’sopin-
ionwithamagnitude of|backf(B −B )|(multipliedbyI )but in the opposite
j i j,i
direction of the opinion of j. This potentially makes the new opinion of agent i
more distant from that of j.
Authority Bias. Another common cognitive bias in social networks is the
authority bias [9] under which individuals tend to blindly follow authoritative
or influential figures often to the extreme. Let β = fan be the sign function,
i,j
i.e., fan(x) = x/|x| if x ̸= 0, otherwise fan(x) = 0. This bias illustrates a case
of die-hard fanaticism of i towards j. Intuitively, when confronted with any
disagreementx=B −B ̸=0,thisbiascontributestochangingi’sopinionwith
j i
the highest magnitude, i.e., |β (x)|=1, in the direction of the opinion of j.
i,j
Finally we illustrate a bias that, unlike the previous, causes agents to ignore
opinions of others. We call it the insular bias β =ins and it is defined as the
i,j
zero function ins:x(cid:55)→0.
The particular bias function examples of Ex.1 are depicted in the square re-
gion [−1,1]2 inFig.1.ThefunctionsmayseemsomewhatadhocbutinSection3
weidentifyabroadfamily ofbiasfunctions intheregion[−1,1]2 thatguarantees
a property of central interest in multi-agent opinion evolution; namely, whether
all the agents will converge to the same opinion, i.e. convergence to consensus.
Remark 2. WeconcludethissectionbynotingthatunliketheDeGrootmodel,in
Eq.3 we allow agents to react with a distinct bias function to each of their influ-
encers. This broadens the range of captured opinion dynamics and we illustrate
this in the next section with an example exhibiting agents with different bias
functions including those in Ex.1. This, however, comes at a price; the update

function can be non-linear in the agents’ opinions (see e.g., functions backf and
conf). Thus, the analysis of opinion convergence using Markov chain theory for
linear-system evolution as done for the DeGroot model is no longer applicable.
In Section 3 we study opinion convergence using methods from real analysis.
2.5 Vaccine Example
Let us suppose that the proposition of interest is “vaccines are unsafe” and
G=(A,E,I)isasinFig.2.Supposethatinitallytheagents1,2,3areanti-vaxers
with opinion values 1.0,0.9,0.8 about the proposition. In contrast, agents 4,5,6
are initially pro-vaxers, with opinion values 0.2,0.1,0.0 about the proposition.
Thus, the initial state of opinion is B0 =(1.0,0.9,0.8,0.2,0.1,0.0).
Notice that although agent 1 is the most extreme anti-vaxer, agent 6, the
most extreme vaxer, has the highest possible influence over them. As we shall
illustrate below, depending on the bias of 1 towards 6, this may have a strong
impact on the evolution of the opinion of agent 1.

Fig.2: Influence graph for vaccine example.8 Alvim et al.
We now consider the evolution of their opinion under different update func-
tions obtained by combining biases from Ex.1. In Fig.3 we show the evolution
of opinions of vaxxers and anti-vaxxers using combinations of the bias func-
tions from Fig.1. Consider Fig.3a. Agent 2 reaches the extreme opinion value
1.0 rather quickly because of their die-hard fanaticism towards the opinion of
1 (i.e., β = fan). As the influence of 6 on agent 1 backfires (β = back),
2,1 1,6
agent 1 stays with belief value 1.0. Eventually, all the other biases contribute to
changingthebeliefvalueoftheinfluencedagentstowards1.0.Indeed,theagents
converge to a consensus that vaccines are unsafe.
In Fig.3b, the influence of 3 on agent 5 backfires, since β = backf. This
5,3
makes their disagreement increase, moving agent 5’s opinion closer to 0. On the
other hand, the opinion of agent 6 is influenced at the same time by the belief
values of 5 and 4 as in the DeGroot model (β = β = degroot) so her
6,5 6,4
opinion stays between theirs.

behaviour of agent 5. The fanaticism of agent 5 propagates also to agent 6 since
he is influenced by agent 5 by degroot bias.
Finally,noticethebehavioursinFig.3whenalltheagentshavethesamebias.
In particular, Fig.3g suggests convergence to consensus when all the agents are
under confirmation bias. In fact convergence to consensus is indeed guaranteed
for this example as we shall later see in this paper.
The above illustrates that different types of biases can have strong impact
on opinion evolution for a given influence graph. In the next section, we will
identify meaningful families of bias as functions in the region [−1,1]2.
3 Bias Region and Consensus
Consensus is a property of central interest in social learning models. Indeed,
failuretoconvergetoaconsensusisoftenanindicatorofpolarizationinasociety.
Definition 4 (Consensus). Let (G,B0,µ ) be an opinion model with G =
G
(A,E,I). We say that the subset of agents A′ ⊆A convergestoanopinionvalue
v ∈ [0,1] iff for every i ∈ A′, lim Bt = v. We say A′ ⊆ A converges to
t→∞ i
consensus iff A′ converges to an opinion value v for some v.
In this section we identify a broad and meaningful region of [−1,1]2 where
all the continuous disagreement bias functions guarantee that agents converge
to consensus under certain topological conditions on the influence graph.
3.1 Bias Regions
In what follows we say that a bias β is in a region R⊆[−1,1]2 if its function
i,j
graph is included in R, i.e., if {(x,β (x)) | x ∈ [−1,1]} ⊆ R. We now identify
i,j
regions of [−1,1]2 that capture several notions of cognitive bias.A Multi-Agent Model for Opinion Evolution under Cognitive Biases 9

different biases. Each plot represents the evolution in time of the opinion of the
agent in Fig.2 with the same color.
Definition 5 (Bias Regions). Let S be the square region [−1,1]2. Let the
(sub)regions M,R,B,I⊆S, named Malleability, Receptive-Resistant, Backfire
and Insular, be defined as follows:
M={(x,y)∈S |(x<0 and y ≤x) or (x>0 and y ≥x) or x=0}
R={(x,y)∈S | (x<0 and x<y <0) or (x>0 and 0<y <x) or x=y =0}
B={(x,y)∈S | (x<0 and 0<y) or (x>0 and y <0) or x=y =0}
I={(x,y)∈S | y =0}.
The regions are depicted in Fig.4. Notice that if a point (x,y) of a bias β
i,j
is in the Malleability region M (i.e., y = β (x) and (x,y) ∈ M) it means that
i,j
for a disagreement x = B −B between j and i, the bias will contribute with
j i
a magnitude |y|≥|x| (multiplied by I ) to changing the opinion of i in the di-
j,i
rection of j’s opinion. Since |y|≥|x|, depending on the value of I , the opinion
j,i
of i may move to match j’s opinion or even further (which can make i’s new10 Alvim et al.

opinion even more extreme than that of j). Individuals that blindly follow au-
thoritativeorinfluentialfigures,easilyswayedagents,fanaticism,amongothers,
can be modelled by bias functions in this region. Indeed the function fan from
Ex.1 is in M (see Fig.1). The identity bias function degroot is also in M.
Like in the case above, if a point (x,y) of a bias β is in the Receptive-
i,j
Resistant region R, it also means that for a disagreement x = B −B ̸= 0
j i
betweenj andi,thebiascontributestochangingtheopinionofiinthedirection
of j’s opinion. Nevertheless, the magnitude of contribution is not as high as the
previous case, namely it is |y| with |x| > |y| > 0. Individuals that are receptive
to other opinions but, unlike malleable ones, may demonstrate some resistance,
reluctance, or skepticism to fully accept them, can be modelled in this region.
Theconfirmationbiasfunctionconf(x)=x(1+δ−|x|)/(1+δ)fromEx.1,where
δ >0 is a very small constant, is in R (see Fig.1).
In fact, it is worth noticing that for any constant δ > 0, the resulting bias
function β (x)=x(1+δ−|x|)/(1+δ) is in R. In the limit, however, we have
i,j
lim x(1+δ−|x|)/(1+δ) = x = degroot(x) which is not in R but in M.
δ→∞
Therefore, δ could be viewed as a parameter of receptiveness; the higher the
value of δ, the more receptive and less resistant agent i is toward j’s opinion. In
the limit, agent i is not resistant and behaves as a malleable agent towards j.
Contrary to the previous two cases, if a point (x,y) of a bias β is in the
i,j
Back-Fire region B, it means that for a disagreement x=B −B ̸=0 between
j i
j and i, the bias contributes to changing the opinion of i but in the opposite
direction of j’s opinion. This bias can then cause the disagreement between i
and j to grow. Individuals that become more extreme when confronted with a
different opinion can be modelled by bias functions in this region. Indeed, the
function backf from Ex.1 is in B (see Fig.1).
Finally, if a point (x,y) of a bias β is in the Insular region I, it means
i,j
that y = 0, thus for a disagreement x = B −B ̸= 0 between j and i, the bias
j i
causes i to completely ignore the opinion of j. Individuals that are stubbornA Multi-Agent Model for Opinion Evolution under Cognitive Biases 11
or closed-minded can be modelled with the function in this region. In fact, the
function ins from Ex.1 is the only function in I (see Fig.1).
We conclude this section with a proposition stating that we can dispense
with the clamp function whenever all the bias functions are in the R region.
Proposition 1 (Update with Bias in R). Given a Bias Opinion Model
(G,B0,µ ) with G = (A,E,I), if for all (a,b) ∈ E we have β ∈ R, then

The proof of this proposition can be found in the Appendix.
3.2 Consensus under Receptiveness in Strongly Connected Graphs
Our first main result states the convergence to consensus for strongly connected
societies when all bias functions are continuous and in the Receptive-Resistant
Region defined in 3.1. We need some standard notions from graph theory.
Recall that a path from i to j in G=(A,E,I) is a sequence i i ...i such
0 1 m
that i=i , j =i and (i ,i ),(i ,i ),...(i ,i ) are edges in E. The graph
0 m 0 1 1 2 m−1 m
G is strongly connected iff there is path from any agent to any other. We can
now state our first consensus result.
Theorem 1 (Consensus I). Let (G,B0,µ) be a bias opinion model with a
strongly connected graph G=(A,E,I). Suppose that for every (j,i)∈E, β is
i,j
a continuous function in R. Then the set of agents A converges to consensus.
Hence, the continuous bias functions in R guarantee consensus in strongly
connected graphs, regardless of initial beliefs. Intuitively, the theorem says that
a strongly connected community/society will converge towards consensus if its
members are receptive but resistant to the opinions of others.
Notice that the Vaccine Example in Sec.2.5 with all agents under confirma-
tion bias satisfy the conditions of Th.1, so their convergence to consensus is
guaranteed.Infact,theopiniondifferencebetweenanytwoagentsgrowssmaller
rather rapidly (Fig.3g illustrates this). In contrast, Fig.5 illustrates an exam-
ple, with different a different bias also in R, where the opinion difference grows
smaller much slowly. But since such an example also satisfies the conditions of
Th.1, convergence to consensus is guaranteed.
Before outlining the proof of this theorem, we elaborate on its conditions.
Discontinuous Bias. Requiring continuity for the bias functions in Th.1 seems
reasonable; small changes in an opinion disagreement value x=B −B should

will not converge to consensus (their belief values will approach 3 and 1, but

will never reach those values). Figure 6 illustrates this example.12 Alvim et al.

BiasOutsideR. NoticethatTh.1requiresbiasfunctionstobeintheresponsive-
resistant region R. We consider counter-examples where we allow bias functions
outside this region in Th.1. If we allowed continuous bias functions outside R
with points in the backfire region B, then the scenario in Fig.3f provides a
counter-example to consensus. If we allow continuous bias functions outside R
with points in region M, then the scenario in Fig.7 is a counter-example to
consensus: notice how the absolute value of their disagreement begins at 0.001
and increases until it reaches 1. Finally, it is clear that if we allowed the only
function in I, the insular bias, with the graph in Fig.6b and initial beliefs B0 =
(0,1), consensus will never be reached since the agents will ignore each other.
3.3 Proof Outline of Th.1.
In this Section we outline the proof of Th.1. In the process we single out the
centralpropertiesofthebehaviourofagentsthatarereceptiveandyetresistant
to disagreement. The complete proof can can be found in the appendix.
Let (G,B0,µ) be as in the statement of Th.1. Suppose B = µt(B0) is the
state of opinion at some time t ≥ 0 where consensus has not yet been reached:
i.e., assume min(B) ̸= max(B) where min(B) and max(B) are the minimum
and maximum opinion values in B. By assumption, all the biases β are in R.
i,j
Thus β (x)=y, where x=B −B , contributes to update the opinion of i in
i,j j i
the direction of the opinion of j but with a magnitude |y| > 0 strictly smaller
than |x| if |x|>0 (or equal to 0 if |x|=0). Using this and Prop.17, we show the
new (updated) opinion of each i, µ(B) , is bounded as follows:
i

are always between the minimum and the maximum of those values.A Multi-Agent Model for Opinion Evolution under Cognitive Biases 13

Lemma 1 (Update Bounds). For each i∈A, min(B)≤µ(B) ≤max(B).
i
We use the above lemma to prove that the bounded sequences of minimum
and maximum opinion values at each time, {min(Bt)} and {max(Bt)} ,
t≥0 t≥0
are monotonically non-decreasing and monotonically non-increasing. Thus by
the Monotone convergence theorem [10], they both converge. Therefore, by the
Squeeze theorem [10], to prove Th.1, it suffices to show that {min(Bt)} and
t≥0
{max(Bt)} converge to the same value.
t≥0
We first prove the following lemma which intuitively states that the number
of extreme agents decrease with time.
Lemma 2 (Extreme Agents Reduction). Suppose that min(B) ̸= max(B)
and let M =max(B). If G has a path i ...i such that B =M and B <M,
1 n in i1
then |{j ∈ A : B ≥ M}| > |{j ∈ A : µ(B) ≥ M}|. A symmetric property
j j
applies to the minimum.
To see the lemma’s intuition, notice that since G is strongly connected and
min(B)<max(B), G indeed has a path i ...i such that B =M =max(B)
1 n in
andB <M.Inthepathsomeagenti whosebeliefvalueisequaltoM willbe
i1 k

are in R, the opinion of i will change in the direction of the smaller value, and
k
thus will strictly decrease. Also, no agent that had a smaller belief value will
reach the current maximum, as the bias functions are in the region R.
Thus, because of Lem.2 and G being strongly connected, we conclude that
the maximum (minimum) belief value will eventually decrease (increase). I.e.,
Corollary 1. Suppose that min(B) ̸= max(B). Then there exist s,t > 0 such
that max(µs(B))<max(B) and min(µt(B))>min(B).14 Alvim et al.

We now apply Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem [10]8 to find a sub-sequence
{Bt} t∈∆ of {Bt} t∈N that converges to some B∞. Notice that {max(Bt)} t∈∆
converges to max(B∞) and it is a sub-sequence of the convergent sequence
{max(Bt)} t∈N, so {max(Bt)} t∈N should also converge to max(B∞). Since each
bias function β is continuous, the update function µ is continuous. There-
i,j
fore, {µ(Bt)} converges to µ(B∞), and thus {max(µ(Bt))} converges to
t∈∆ t∈∆
max(µ(B∞)). But since the sequence {max(µ(Bt))} ={max(Bt+1)} is a
t∈∆ t∈∆
sub-sequence of the convergent sequence {max(Bt)} t∈N, both must converge to
the same value, hence max(B∞) = max(µ(B∞)). Similarly, we can show that
min(B∞)=min(µ(B∞)). It can thus be shown that if we repeatedly apply µ to
B∞, the maximum should not change, and the same applies to the minimum.
More precisely, we conclude the following.
Corollary 2. max(B∞) = max(µt(B∞)) and min(B∞) = min(µt(B∞)) for
each t≥0.
Consequently, if min(B∞) ̸= max(B∞) then Cor.1 and Cor.2 lead us to a
contradiction. Therefore, min(B∞) = max(B∞) and thus, {min(Bt)} and
t≥0
{max(Bt)} converge to the same value max(B∞) as wanted.

3.4 Consensus Under Receptiveness in Arbitrary Graphs
RecallthatTh.1appliestostronglyconnectedinfluencegraphs.Oursecondmain
result applies to arbitrary influence graphs. First we need to recall the notion of
strongly-connected components of a graph.
8 Every infinite bounded sequence in Rn has a convergent sub-sequence.A Multi-Agent Model for Opinion Evolution under Cognitive Biases 15
A strongly-connected component of G is a maximal subset S ⊆ A such that
for each two i,j ∈S, there is path from i to j. A strongly-connected component
S is said to be a source component iff there is no edge (i,j) ∈ E such that
i∈A\S and j ∈S. We use S(G) to denote the set of source components of G.
Intuitively, a source component of a graph can be thought of as a closed
groupthatisnotexternallyinfluencedbutmayinfluenceindividualsoutsidethe
group. The following theorem gives a characterization of consensus with biases
in R for arbitrary graphs in terms of source components.
Theorem 2 (Consensus II). Let (G,B0,µ) be a bias opinion model with G=
(A,E,I). Suppose that for every (j,i) ∈ E, β is a continuous function in R.
i,j
Then the set of agents A converges to consensus iff there exists v ∈ [0,1] such
that every source component S ∈S(G) converges to opinion v.
Theabovetheorem,whoseproofcanbefoundintheAppendix,providesthe
following intuitive yet insightful remark. Namely, upon agreeing on an opinion,
the closed and potentially influential groups, can make all individuals converge
to that opinion in a society whose members are receptive but resistant.
4 Concluding Remarks and Related Work
We introduced a generalization of the DeGroot Model where agents interact
under different biases. We identified the notion of bias on disagreement and
made it the focus our model. This allowed us to identify families of biases that
captureabroaderrangeofsocialdynamics.Wealsoprovided theoreticalresults
characterizing the notion of consensus for a broad family of cognitive biases.
The relevance of biased reasoning in human interactions has been studied
extensively in [12], [9], [11], and others. There is a great deal of work on formal
modelsforbeliefchangeinsocialnetworks;wefocusontheworkonbiased belief
update, which is the focus of this paper. Some models were previously proposed
to generalize the DeGroot model and introduce bias, for instance [4], [3] and
[14] analyse the effects of incorporating a bias factor for each agent to represent
biased assimilation: how much of the external opinions the agent will take into
consideration. [13] extends the model [4] to include the effect of backfire-effect
as well. The main difference of these models to our model is that biases are
not incorporated in those models in terms of the disagreement level between
agents,buteitherasanexponentialfactorthatreducestheimpactoftheopinion
of neighbours or by dynamically changing the weights of the DeGroot model.
Thus, our model brings a new point of view to how distinct types of biases can
be represented and identified.
In [7], it is proved that “constricting” update functions, roughly, functions
where the extreme agents move closer to each other, lead to convergence in
strongly connected social networks. This is similar to our theorem, indeed, the
functions in our R region are easily shown to be constricting. However, their
social network model is more abstract than ours and further from real social
networks, and they do not directly analyse biases as a function of disagreement.16 Alvim et al.

Lemma A.4. There are U,L ∈ [0,1] such that lim max(Bt) = U and

t→∞
Proof. It follows directly from Lem.A.3 that max(Bt) and min(Bt) are respec-
tively monotonically non-increasing and monotonically non-decreasing with re-
spect to t. Then, for any integer t ≥ 0 we have max(Bt+1) ≤ max(Bt) and
min(Bt+1)≥min(Bt). Thus, the result follows from the monotone convergence
theorem[10].
Lemma A.5. The function µ is continuous.
Proof. Note that we can compute lim µ(Y) from it’s individual values: let
Y→B
(cid:80)
i ∈ A. Then, by Lem.A.1, we get µ(Y) = Y + I β (Y −Y ). Also,

thus concluding our proof, as B is arbitrary.

Proof. FirstnotethatbyLem.A.3,themaximumcannotincrease,whichmeans
that max(µ(B)) ≤ max(B), and also by Lem.A.1 the clamp function has no

Now note that if B < max(B), then if A ̸= ∅, we can use Lem.A.1 to

The proof for the minimum is symmetrical.
Remark A.4 (Composition of µ). We consider that µ0(B) = B and µkB =
µk−1(µ(B)) for any integer k >0.
Lemma A.7. Suppose that min(B) ̸= max(B) and let M = max(B). If G has
a path i ...i such that B = M and B < M, then max(µ|A|−1(B)) <
1 m im i1
max(B). A symmetrical property applies to the minimum.
Proof. NotethatBhasatmost|A|−1agentswithbeliefvaluemax(B),otherwise
min(B)=max(B). Then, by Lem.A.6, in µ(B) we have at most |A|−2 agents
with belief value max(B). Let k > 0 be the smallest integer such that µk(B)
has no agent with belief max(B), and note that this means that µk−1(B) has at
least one agent with belief max(B). We first prove that that k ≤|A|−1:
Weknowµk−1(B)hasatleastoneagentwithbeliefmax(B),andbyLem.A.6,
for all k ≥ y > 0 we know that the number of agents in µy−1(B) with belief
max(B) is at least one plus the number of agents with that belief in µy(B).
This means that for all k ≥ z ≥ 0, µz(B) has at least k−z agents with belief
value max(B). If (for the sake of contradiction) k ≥|A|, µ0(B)=B would have
at least k −0 = k ≥ |A| agents with belief greater than or equal to max(B),
and because this would mean B is consensus, we have a contradiction with
max(B)̸=min(B).
Now note that, by Lem.A.3 if µk(B) has no agent with belief max(B), then
this means that max(µk(B)) < max(B), and it also means that for all z ≥ k,
max(µz(B)) ≤ max(µk(B)) < max(B). So, as we just proved k ≤ |A| − 1,
max(µ|A|−1(B))≤max(µk(B))<max(B), as desired.
Remark A.5 (Source Components). A strongly-connected component of G is a
maximal subset S ⊆A such that for each two i,j ∈S, there is path from i to j.
Astrongly-connectedcomponentS issaidtobeasource component iffnoagent
in S is influenced by an agent outside S, i.e., iff there is no edge (i,j)∈E such
that i ∈ A\S and j ∈ S. From now on we use S(G) to be the set of source
components of G.20 Alvim et al.
Theorem A.1 (Consensus I, Thm.1 of Sec.3). Let (G,B0,µ) be a bias
opinion model with a strongly connected graph G = (A,E,I). Suppose that for
every (j,i) ∈ E, β is a continuous function in R. Then the set of agents A
i,j
converges to consensus.
Proof. By Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem[10], for all integers t ≥ 0, as all values
of Bt are bounded in [0,1], there is a convergent infinite subsequence of the
sequence {Bt} t∈N. Let this be {Bt} t∈∆, and let the value to which it converges
be B∞. Now let Γk = {Bt+k} , and note that this is equal to {µk(Bt)} .
t∈∆ t∈∆
By Lem.A.5, this sequence converges to µk(B∞), because the composition of
continuous functions is also continuous. We will use k =|A|−1 in this theorem.
Letlim max(Bt)=U (thislimitexistsbecauseofLem.A.4),and,forthe
t→∞
sake of contradiction, suppose B∞ is not consensus. Then, note that, as assume
thatthegraphisstronglyconnectedwecanguaranteethatthepathassumption
of Lem.A.7 is satisfied for B =B∞, with i ∈A such that B∞ =min(B∞) and
1 i1
i ∈ A such that B∞ = max(B∞). Then, by Lem.A.7, max(µ|A|−1(B∞)) <
m im
max(B∞).
We can reach a contradiction of this using the fact that {max(Bt)}
t∈∆
(which converges to max(B∞)) is a subsequence of the convergent sequence
{max(Bt)} t∈N.AsthelatterconvergestoU,sodoestheformer,soU =max(B∞).
Also, {µ|A|−1(Bt)} converges to µ|A|−1(B∞) as µ is continuous. We also no-
t∈∆
tice that {max(µ|A|−1(Bt))} = {max(Bt+|A|−1)} converges to the value
t∈∆ t∈∆

max(µ|A|−1(B∞))=U =max(B∞)whichisacontradictionwiththeinequality
max(µ|A|−1(B∞))<max(B∞). Thus, B∞ must be consensus.
Let v be the value such that for all i ∈ A, B∞ = v. As {max(Bt)}
i t∈∆
(which converges to max(B∞)=v) is a subsequence of the convergent sequence
{max(Bt)} t∈N, both converge to the same value, so lim t→∞max(Bt) = v. The
same applies for the minimum, so lim max(Bt) = v = lim min(Bt),
t→∞ t→∞
and as max(Bt) ≤ Bt ≤ min(Bt) for all i ∈ A (Lem.A.3), by the Squeeze
i
Theorem[10], A converges to consensus.
Theorem A.2 (Consensus II, Thm. 2 of Sec.3). Let (G,B0,µ) be a bias
opinion model with G = (A,E,I). Suppose that for every (j,i) ∈ E, β is a
i,j
continuous function in R. Then the set of agents A converges to consensus iff
there exists v ∈ [0,1] such that every source component S ∈ S(G) converges to
opinion v.
Proof. If there is no v ∈ [0,1] such that all source components converges to v,
then A does not converge to consensus by definition.
If there is such a v ∈ [0,1], then we only need to show that the belief value
of agents outside of source components converge to v.
By Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem[10], for all integers t ≥ 0, as all values

sequence {Bt} t∈N. Let this be {Bt} t∈∆, and let the value to which it convergesA Multi-Agent Model for Opinion Evolution under Cognitive Biases 21
be B∞. Now let Γk = {Bt+k} , and note that this is equal to {µk(Bt)} .

By Lem.A.5, this sequence converges to µk(B∞), because the composition of
continuous functions is also continuous. We will use k =|A|−1 in this theorem.
Letmax(B∞)=U,andforthesakeofcontradiction,supposeB∞ isnotcon-
sensus.Thenatleastoneofthefollowingissatisfied:min(B∞)̸=v,max(B∞)̸=
v. We will assume max(B∞)̸=v, if that’s not the case we can get a symmetric
proof with min(B∞)̸=v.
Also note that, as we assume that the belief value of all agents in source
components converge to v, then their belief values will also converge to v in
the subsequence {Bt} . So if i∈S for some S ∈S(G), then B∞ =v. So can

Then, by Lem.A.7, max(µ|A|−1(B∞))<max(B∞).
We can reach a contradiction of this using the fact that {max(Bt)}

(which converges to max(B∞)) is a subsequence of the convergent sequence
{max(Bt)} t∈N.AsthelatterconvergestoU,sodoestheformer,soU =max(B∞).
Also, {µ|A|−1(Bt)} converges to µ|A|−1(B∞) as µ is continuous. We also no-

Let v be the value such that for all i ∈ A, B∞ = v. As {max(Bt)}

(which converges to max(B∞)=v) is a subsequence of the convergent sequence
{max(Bt)} t∈N, both converge to the same value, so lim t→∞max(Bt) = v. The

and as max(Bt) ≤ Bt ≤ min(Bt) for all i ∈ A (Lem.A.3), by the Squeeze
