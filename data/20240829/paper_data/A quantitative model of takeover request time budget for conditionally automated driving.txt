the time budget required by drivers to takeover have been provided. In this contribution, fixed (7 s) and
variable time budgets (6 s, 5 s, and 4 s) with and without visual imagery assistance were investigated for
suitability in three takeover scenarios using performance measures such as average lateral displacement.

theobtainedresultsandknownrelationsbetweentakeovervariables,amathematicalformulaforestimating
takeover request time budget is proposed. The proposed formula integrates individual stimulus response
time,drivingexperience,scenariospecificrequirementsandallowsincreasedsafetyfortakeovermaneuvers.
Furthermore, the visual imagery resulted in increased takeover time which invariably increases the time
