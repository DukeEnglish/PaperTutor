VII. CONCLUSIONANDFUTUREWORKS
In this paper, we propose a novel Gaussian distribution-
based centroidal Voronoi tessellation (GCVT) concept in-
spired by traditional CVT and develop two approximation
methods to solve the GCVT problems. Building on this
foundation, we developed SwarmCVT, a new variant of the
adaptive distribution optimal control (ADOC) algorithm for
path planning in environments with known obstacle layouts.
WeevaluatedtheperformanceofSwarmCVTagainstADOC

sultsdemonstratedthatSwarmCVTsignificantlyoutperforms

new research directions, and future work will explore addi-
tional applications and further improvements to the GCVT
framework.
