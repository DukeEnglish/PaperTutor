ABSTRACT
This paper introduces an agent-based simulation model aimed at understanding urban commuters’ mode
choices and evaluating the impacts of transport policies to promote sustainable mobility. Crafted for
developingcountries,whereutilitariantravelheavilyreliesonmotorcycles,themodelintegratessociocultural
factors that influence transport behavior. Multinomial models and inferential statistics applied to survey
data from Cali, Colombia, inform the model, revealing significant influences of sociodemographic factors
and travel attributes on mode choice. Findings highlight the importance of cost, time, safety, comfort, and
personal security, with disparities across socioeconomic groups. Policy simulations demonstrate positive
responsestointerventionslikefreepublictransportation,increasedbusfrequency,andenhancedsecurity,yet
with modest shifts in mode choice. Multifaceted policy approaches are deemed more effective, addressing
diverse user preferences. Outputs can be extended to cities with similar sociocultural characteristics and
transport dynamics. The methodology applied in this work can be replicated for other territories.
1 INTRODUCTION
The analysis of transport mode choices is crucial for urban planners and policy makers. By understanding

suitable for analyzing the impacts of transport policies (Wise, Crooks, and Batty 2017). However, the
applicationofABMinanalyzingtransportmodechoiceshasbeenlimitedandstudieshavebeenconducted
predominantly in developed countries (Cadavid and Salazar-Serna 2021; Salazar-Serna, Cadavid, Franco,
and Carley 2023). The effectiveness of these findings may not extend seamlessly to developing regions
duetodifferentcontextualpolicyneedsandthedistinctwayssocioeconomicandculturalfactorsinfluence
human behavior (Carley 1991; Salazar-Serna et al. 2023). Therefore, policies that have been successful in
one setting might not achieve similar outcomes in another.
Previous studies in transportation have identified various determinants affecting mode choice. These
factors can be grouped into several categories: sociodemographic characteristics such as age, sex, occu-
pation, and income level (Ashalatha et al. 2013); travel habits including distance traveled, travel time,
origin-destinationpairs,andtrippurpose(Madhuwanthietal. 2016);andattributesofthebuiltenvironment
like design, density, and capacity (Ewing and Cervero 2010). Additionally, attitudes and perceptions re-
gardingtransportmodes,whichcoveraspectssuchascomfort,cost,security,safety,quality,andreliability,
play a crucial role (Fu 2021). Culture, as Olson suggests, profoundly shapes these attitudes by influencing

beliefs and expectations about transport modes (Olson and Olson 2003).
Models are designed to simulate the behavior of real systems. When representing human behavior,
it is crucial to include the sociocultural factors that influence such behaviors. Although prior research
offers insights into these factors, accurately defining them based on the models developed for a different
context can be challenging. In the global South, the dynamics of utilitarian transportation heavily rely
on two- and three-wheeler vehicles with engine capacities below 200 cc, predominantly owned by low-
and middle-income families (PAHO 2017). These vehicles are favored for their flexibility, low cost, and
the ability to provide quick commutes—an essential alternative to often inadequate public transportation
systems(ChiuandGuerra2023;TanabeandAsahi2018). Incontrast,indevelopedcountries,motorcycles,
particularlythosedesignedforadventureandtouring,areprimarilyusedforleisure(BroughtonandWalker
2016). Thesubstantialandincreasingprevalenceofmotorcyclesindevelopingcountriespresentsadditional
challenges for policymakers in terms of emission control, road fatalities, and managing extended travel
times caused by congestion (Bakker 2018; Suatmadi, Creutzig, and Otto 2019). Given these complex and
particular conditions, there is a pressing need for models that are specifically tailored to the sociocultural
contexts of these regions.
This paper presents the results from an agent-based simulation model designed to represent utilitarian
travelers in developing countries. These travelers interact within the model to make decisions about their
primarymeansoftransportation. Inanefforttoprovideatooltoanalyzetheimpactsoftransportpolicy,we

2 METHODS
2.1 Agent-based simulation model
Initially, a high-level conceptual model was established, grounded in previous research on mode choices
using ABM and integrating consumer behavior principles that drive individuals’ decision-making (Faboya
et al. 2020; Kangur et al. 2017). Inspired in the CONSUMAT approach (Jager and Janssen 2012), this
model accounts for various factors to apply the cognitive process, including personal trip satisfaction and
uncertainty about trying new transportation modes, and emphasizes the role of social interactions; agents
gatherinformationandmakecomparisonswithintheirsocialnetworktodealwiththeuncertaintyandmake
decisions.
Agents begin the simulation using a mode of transportation among private car, motorcycle, or public
transit. The initial distribution of transport users depends on their sociodemographic characteristics.
Throughout the simulation, modal shifts take place during decision periods based on the strategies agentsSalazar-Serna, Cadavid, and Franco
adopt after assessing their mental models. Fig. 1 illustrates the cognitive process that agents follow to
select one of the decision-making strategies.

Trip satisfaction is calculated as a weighted sum of satisfaction levels for each factor affecting mode
choice. The subsequent subsections describe the factors considered in the satisfaction function. The
uncertainty arises from insufficient knowledge about transport modes, which can be mitigated by com-
bining personal experience using them with peer experiences from one’s social network; two parameters
representinguncertaintyavoidanceandcollectivebelongingnessweighttheuncertaintylevel. Theresulting
satisfaction and uncertainty values are then compared to individual thresholds for desired satisfaction and
tolerable uncertainty; based on this comparison, agents repeat, imitate, inquire, or deliberate to select a
commutingmodeforthesubsequentperiod. Thosewhoimitatethemostusedmodeorinquire(comparethe
possiblesatisfactionwithothers’modes)interactwiththeirsocialnetworktomakedecisions. Apreferential
attachment topology connects agents in the model, with a higher likelihood of forming ties with similar
individuals within the same socioeconomic group. See (Salazar-Serna, Ng, Carley, Cadavid, and Franco
2023) for more information of the social network impact on the mode choice.
Themodelwasvalidatedusingthevalidationinpartstechnique(Carley1996),whereinputs,processes,
andoutputsareincrementallyvalidated. Consistencywasevaluatedusingextremevalues,andoutputswere
assessed using data from Cali city. To evaluate the outputs, the model was initialized and run 100 times
for three periods with distributions corresponding to 2018. The proportions of transport users were then
compared with the real data in 2020 (Alcaldia/de/Cali 2024). As shown in Figure 2, the simulation results
replicate the emerging behavior where private alternatives increase the proportion of users, and the public
service decreases. A second analysis was carried out comparing the 10-year forecast of the simulation
against the S-curve calculated with the Bass model of diffusion for motorcycles (Coronado Hernández,
Romero Conrado, Calderon Perez, and Uribe Martes 2018). The nonlinear Bass model was implemented
inRsoftwareusingmotorcycleregistriesinCalibetween2007and2023. Resultsobtainedwiththeagent-
based model follow a similar trajectory for the number of new motorcycles expected to be in circulation
in the next decade, according to the Bass forecast (see Figure 3).

transport mode, and the wealth, gender, and age distribution of the synthetic population were determined
using historical records from Cali (Alcaldia/de/Cali 2024). Parameters associated with travel behavior are
generallyavailableinorigin-destinationsurveys;however,themostrecentupdateforthissurveyinCaliwas
in 2015 (Metrocali 2015), and since then, urban development has significantly altered the city’s mobility
dynamics. Moreover, there is a group of parameters related to the sociocultural characteristics of agents
thatinfluencedecision-making,suchasperceptionsoftransportattributes(travelcost,roadsafety,personal
security, comfort, air pollution), uncertainty avoidance, and collectivism levels, are often unmeasured or
omitted in household or origin-destination surveys. Given this gap in the available information and the
need to accurately represent the current context of the city under study, it was decided to enhance our
research by designing and implementing a new survey.
Thesurveywasmeticulouslycrafted,drawingfrombothestablisheddeterminantsoftravelmodechoices
identified in existing literature (Agarwal et al. 2020; Ahmed et al. 2021; Fan and Chen 2020; Gadepalli
et al. 2020) and insights garnered from two focus groups involving transport users from Cali, Colombia.
Structured to gather comprehensive data, the questionnaire delves into respondents’ sociodemographic
profiles, travel habits, and perceptions regarding public transit, private cars, and motorcycles. For further
details, the supplementary material provides access to the survey dictionary. A dashboard that offers an
interactive summary of the survey results can be found in Salazar-Serna and Diaz (2023).

Toaccuratelyrepresenttheagents’attributesinthesimulationmodel,capturingthesocioculturalaspects
influencing travel behavior is essential. One of the purposes of the survey data analysis is to establish
whether there are differences among the various commuter groups regarding their perceptions and the
importance they assign to factors affecting mode choice. Comparisons of groups by socioeconomic status
and transport mode were performed using a Kruskal-Wallis test followed by a Mann-Whitney U test for
pairwisecomparisonswithcontinuousvariables. CategoricalvariableswerecomparedusingtheChi-square
(χ2) test of independence or Fisher’s exact test.
2.4 Simulation experiments
The model implemented in NetLogo 6.4.0 was initialized with the values for Cali city corresponding to
2022. Abasecasescenariowasrun80timesaftercheckingthenumberofrepetitionsatwhichthecoefficient
of variation in results stabilizes. Time steps are counted as ticks that are equivalent to 2 minutes of a peak
hour on a weekday. During 30 ticks, agents accumulate data from the system and their own commute
to evaluate their mental model and implement a strategy to make a decision about their transport mode.
This time period represents a typical commute year that constitutes the decision period for the agents.
We simulated 10 years to analyze how the distribution of transport users changes over time. In addition,

The base case scenario exhibits the general behavior of the actual system showing a decreasing partic-
ipation of public users who are migrating to private options (cars and motorcycles); with no interventions
in the system, this trend is expected to continue for the coming years. As the ultimate purpose of the
modelistoserveasatestbedtoevaluatetheeffectivenessofpublictransportpoliciesformoresustainable
mobility, a second experiment was run to analyze the impacts of three policies oriented to increase the
public transit usage. According to the survey, one of the most valuable factors for users is travel time,
and the public service has both long travel times and long waiting times; It is expected that reducing the
time to take the bus could have a positive impact on public transit users, influencing their behavior to
continueusingthisservice. Costoftravelandpersonalsecurityarealsotopconcernsforusers,(section3.2

and personal security as public transport policies were individually evaluated. A third group of experi-

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1 Influencing factors identified with the discrete choice models
After running the MNL and MNP models, identical qualitative results were obtained. The supplementary
material contains a link to a folder with the Stata output of the models and a table summarizing the
individual significance of variables. The Wald test shows that mode choice is significantly influenced by:
(1)sociodemographicandeconomicconditions,includinggender,age,andsocioeconomicstatus;(2)travel
behavior aspects such as travel time; and (3) transport attributes evaluated by travelers, including cost,
time, comfort, road safety, personal security, and pollution. These findings align with previous research
on commute mode choices. Studies have identified a gender gap in vehicle ownership (Havet, Bayart, and
Bonnel 2021). The results from the multinomial models suggest women are more likely to use public
transportation than either a car or motorcycle, a trend that may be explained by economic differences and
distinct travel habits compared to men (Rosenbloom 2006).
In our model, the probabilities of starting the simulation with a car or motorcycle are higher for men,
while the assignment rules give a lower probability of having private transportation to younger people,
particularlythoseinmiddleandlowincomebrackets. Previousresearchhasshownthataspeopleage,their
use of public transportation decreases (Basaric´ et al. 2016), and as economic power increases, so does the
desire for the status associated with owning a car or motorcycle (Rodríguez, Santana, and Pardo 2015).
Multinomialmodelsalsorevealthatcomfortandpersonalsecurityaresignificantfactorsinchoosinga
car, whereas cost concerns tend to sway users towards motorcycles. Specifically, in developing countries,
motorcycleownershipispredominantlyamongthoseinthemiddleandlowincomebrackets(Hagen,Pardo,
and Valente 2016). This underscores the importance of accounting for the heterogeneity of transport users
in our simulation model, reflecting common characteristics within groups and disparities between them,
such as socioeconomic status.
After reviewing factors influencing mode choice previously identified in literature and those obtained
with the multinomial models, we determined the variables to be included in the simulation model. Each
agent is characterized by attributes such as sex, age, socioeconomic status, and a specific commuting
distance, reflecting the population distribution in the city of Cali. During each decision period, agents
calculate their trip satisfaction based on the selected mode. This calculation depends on their satisfaction
with each mode attribute (acquisition cost, operating cost, comfort, road safety, personal security, travel
time, and pollution) and the corresponding weights assigned to these attributes. The weights signify the
importance agents place on each attribute. As indicated by the results of the multinomial models, these
importance levels vary according to individual characteristics. Consequently, this variability underscores
the need to determine the specific level of importance for each attribute for every agent in the simulation,
a topic that will be further analyzed in the following subsection.
3.2 Transport attributes perceptions and differences by users’ groups
Respondents rated the importance of each attribute using a Likert scale, where 5 represents the highest
importance. Figure4presentsthemeanofattributesbysocioeconomicgroups. TheKruskal-Wallistestwas
employed to initially identify potential differences among the three socioeconomic groups: low, middle,
and high. Based on the results displayed in Table 1, we can conclude that significant differences exist in
the perceived relevance of road safety, personal security, operating costs, emissions, and travel time.
Comparisons using the Chi-square (χ2) test reveal that there are no significant differences between
the low- and middle-income groups regarding costs, road safety, and emissions. While the scores for
these attributes are very similar, it should be noted that the importance ranking for these attributes differsSalazar-Serna, Cadavid, and Franco

on the survey (ac.cost = acquisition cost, op.cost= operating cost).
between the groups. For low-income individuals, the three most important aspects of transport mode are
acquisition cost, travel time, and operating cost, with personal security rated the lowest. In contrast, for
the middle-income bracket, time, comfort, and personal security are deemed the most relevant. Pollution
is considered the least important attribute by all groups, consistently receiving the lowest scores.

comfort 0.35 0*** 0*** 0***
time 0*** 0** 0*** 0**
emissions 0** 0.55 0.34 0.60
Between the middle- and high-income groups, statistical differences are evident in the scores for all
attributes except acquisition cost and emissions. However, these groups share the same order of priorities
when evaluating transport modes, even though individuals at higher socioeconomic levels generally assign
higher scores to all attributes. The low and high levels have the greatest differences; the comfort offered
by the transport mode is one of the most decisive things for wealthy users that can pay for it, whilst it is
not relevant for the other group of users; also, crime and road accidents are not a concern for them. It can
explain the high concentration of motorcycles–a low–cost and high–accident risk alternative (Rodríguez,
Santana, and Pardo 2015)—in low income classes that seek to maximize their budget at the expense of
their security.
After identifying significant differences among the socioeconomic groups, the values were converted
to scores between zero and one to be used as weights in the calculation of the satisfaction function. These
scores are normally distributed among agents depending on their socioeconomic status.
3.3 Policy analysis
Using 2022 data from Cali to parameterize the model, we initialized it to simulate the distribution of
transport users over the next decade (see Figure 5(A)). The projected decline in public transit usage alignsSalazar-Serna, Cadavid, and Franco
with current trends (Alcaldia/de/Cali 2024). Without intervention, the model predicts that by 2032, only
14% (C.I. 10%-18%) of commuters will use public transit–12%less–, with significant increases in private
transportusage,22%morecarusersanda9%increaseinmotorcycleusage,withparticipationof61%(C.I.
58%-64%)and25%(C.I.21%-29%)respectively. Theseshiftsarelikelytoworsenthecity’stransportation
issues, including an accident rate exceeding 11 per 100,000 people, increased CO2 emissions, and more
unproductive hours spent in traffic jams.
Based on the transport attributes that agents evaluate after each commuting decision, we assess three
public policy interventions aimed at preventing the migration from public to private modes of transport.
Given that cost is a critical concern for low-income users, who comprise 35% of the city’s population, we

Itisevidentthatallthreepoliciespositivelyimpactthesystembyretainingmoreusersinthepublicservice
than the base-case scenario. However, the net increase in users with any of the three policies implemented
is only 5% at end of the simulation period; this can be attributed to the observed inertia in the system
where the majority of users experience low uncertainty and high satisfaction relative to their thresholds.
As a result, they repeatedly choose the same transport modes. In contrast, a smaller proportion of users
adoptbehaviorsguidedbyalternativestrategieswhenfacedwithdissatisfactionanduncertainty(seeFigure
5(B)).

In the second experiment, we analyze combinations of the policies, affecting two or three attributes
simultaneously. The first combination—altering cost and personal security—presents a positive scenario,

When mixing frequency and security, the results are nearly identical. In contrast, the three-factor policy
shows a more significant impact; the number of public transit users oscillates between 26.5% and 27.2%

4 CONCLUSIONS
This paper presents the results of a simulation model designed to represent mode choice decisions among
urban commuters. The model serves as a testbed for evaluating the impacts of transport policies, aiming
to contribute to the promotion of sustainable mobility. This endeavor represents a pioneering effort in
developing an agent-based model tailored specifically for developing countries, where utilitarian travel
heavily relies on motorcycles and exhibits distinct dynamics compared to those in the global North. BySalazar-Serna, Cadavid, and Franco
focusing on a Colombian city as a representative case, we introduced a methodology for identifying and
incorporating sociocultural aspects that influence transport user behavior into simulation models. Utilizing
multinomial models, we analyzed survey data collected from 970 respondents and conducted statistical
teststoexamineperceptionsamongtransportusersfromdifferentsocioeconomicgroups. Thisinformation
was instrumental in customizing the model for policy analysis in developing countries.
Our analysis, conducted with the MNL and MNP models, underscores that urban mode choice is
significantlyinfluencedbysociodemographicfactorssuchasage,gender,andsocioeconomicstatus. These
discrete choice models also highlight the importance of travel time and distance in mode selection. Fur-
thermore cost, road safety, personal security, time, comfort and travel time are variables significantly
connected to travel decisions. Given the notable disparities between socioeconomic groups in developing
countries, it was relevant to analyze the significance attributed to each of these influential attributes in
decision-making; our findings reveal that cost and time are the most valued aspects for low-income users,
while comfort and personal security hold greater importance for medium- and high-income individuals,
surpassingcostconsiderations. Interestingly,pollutionemergesastheleastvaluedaspectacrossallgroups,

latedintoweightsusedtocalculatetheoverallsatisfactionofcommutersbasedontheirsocioeconomicstatus.
After identifying drivers of mode shift among travelers, representing them in the simulation model
and validating results of a base case scenario, we tested three public policies. These interventions—free
public transportation, doubled frequency in bus services, and enhanced security for system users—were
positively received by current users, resulting in a reduced inclination towards private transportation alter-
natives. Compared to the base case scenario (without policies), the implemented policies led to a decrease
in the number of motorcycles in circulation. However, each policy required a substantial investment in
resources, resulting in only a 5% increase in public transit users. Our findings suggest that policies that
address multiple factors simultaneously are more effective than isolated actions, given that users consider
all variables similarly relevant within this sociocultural context, which poses challenges for policymakers
in devising cost-effective strategies.
Future work will involve comparing policy impacts using different settings of sociocultural variables.
Additionally,furtheranalysisisnecessarytodiscernchangesintravelbehaviorwithinspecificsocioeconomic
groups, as the results presented in this paper focus on detailed user groups by mode. Moreover, a detailed
discussionontheimpactsofpoliciesconcerningCO2emissions, traveltime,androadaccidentsisneeded.
