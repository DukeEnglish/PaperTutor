Abstract
The well-known Condorcet’s Jury theorem posits that the majority rule selects the best
alternative among two available options with probability one, as the population size increases to
infinity. We study this result under an asymmetric two-candidate setup, where supporters of
both candidates may have different participation costs.
When the decision to abstain is fully rational i.e., when the vote pivotality is the probability
of a tie, the only equilibrium outcome is a trivial equilibrium where all voters except those with
zero voting cost, abstain. We propose and analyze a more practical, boundedly rational model
where voters overestimate their pivotality, and show that under this model, non-trivial equilibria
emerge where the winning probability of both candidates is bounded away from one.
We show that when the pivotality estimate strongly depends on the margin of victory, victory
is not assured to any candidate in any non-trivial equilibrium, regardless of population size and
in contrast to Condorcet’s assertion. Whereas, under a weak depedence on margin, Condorcet’s
Jury theorem is restored.
1 Introduction
Consider a population of N voters voting over two alternatives A and B, with A being the better
alternative according to some pre-defined criterion. Consider further that the preference of each
individual voter is determined independently by an outcome of a coin toss with bias p > 0.5 in favour
of the better alternative. That is, each individual voter supports alternative A with probability p
and B with the probability 1−p. Under this setting, the famous Condorcet’s Jury Theorem states
that the majority rule selects candidate A with probability tending to one when population size
increases to infinity.
An implicit assumption in Condorcet’s theorem is that everyone votes, or at least that the decision to
vote does not depend on one’s preference over alternatives. In contrast, in many practical situations
such as political elections, or a local or national referendum, abstention is found to be a common and
prominent phenomenon. For instance, the voter turnout in United States presidential elections has
been around 52%-62% over the past 90 years [Wik22]. Abstention is also observed to be a significant
phenomenon in small-scale lab experiment [Bla00, OG84].
From a rational, economic point of view, the surprise is not that some voters abstain, but that they
vote at all a.k.a. ‘the paradox of voting’. As Anthony Downs claimed already in 1957, a rational
1

1v71300.8042:viXravoter weighs the benefit of voting (which realizes only if the voter is pivotal) against the cost. When
the size of the electorate is large, the expected benefit derived from affecting the outcome of the
election (i.e. being pivotal) is too small to induce voting from a significant fraction of voters [Dow57]
giving rise to the paradox of voting.
While Condorcet’s result holds under the assumption that everyone votes, Down’s theory of rational
voting suggests that only near-zero cost voters vote in large-scale elections. Our goal in this paper
is to understand the equilibria that arise from a plausible, heuristic-based abstention model, in an
attempt to reconcile the theoretical predictions with the moderate turnout rates we see in practice.
The most important questions we focus on are: (1) how many equilibrium points are induced by
the abstention model and where are they located? (2) does the winning probability of the better
candidate approach 1 as predicted by Condorcet’s Jury theorem in any of these equilibria? and (3)
what happens to the equilibrium points as population size increase?
We now present some important models for voter turnout presented in the literature and then move
on to our proposed voter turnout model that depends on heuristic-based perceived pivotality of
individual votes.
The Calculus of Voting model: Originally proposed by [Dow57] and later developed by [RO68],
this model attributes each voter’s decision to abstain from voting to expected cost-benefit analysis.
Let p denotes the perceived pivotality of voter i, whereas V denotes the personal benefit she receives
i i
if her preferred candidate wins an election, D denotes the social benefit she receives by performing
i
a civic duty of voting and G denotes costs of voting she incurs. These costs include the cost of
i
obtaining and processing information and the actual cost of registering and going to polls (see
also [Ald93] for discussion of voting and rational choice). A voter i votes if and only if
p ·V +D ≥ G . (1)
i i i i
The calculus of voting model considers p to be the probability that i’s vote would change the
i
outcome a.k.a. probability of an event that all voters except i reach a tie. The tie probabilities
are derived from the aggregated stochastic votes, and thus the pivot computation and subsequent
equilibrium analysis quickly become intractable as the number of individual voters increases.
MyersonandWeberstudiedvotingequilibriaina3ormorecandidateelectionsbyfixingadistribution
overpreferencesandconsideringalargepopulationsampledfromthisdistribution, sothatcandidates’
scores are multinomial variables [MW93]. While tie probabilities vanish in the limit, they observe
that the relative tie probabilities for each pair of candidates can still be compared and thus voters’
bestresponsesarewelldefined. Inamorerecentwork, Myerson[Mye02]suggestedanotherrelaxation
by approximating candidates’ scores with Poisson distributions.
Crucially, in the above models, the tie probabilities used for voters’ strategic calculations are derived
directly from the vote distribution, either exactly or approximately. When the size of the electorate is
large, the tie probability p ≈ 0. If voting is costly, these models predict very low turnout—essentially
that only the zero-cost voters vote when the population increases to infinity.
Heuristic pivot probabilities: Some models assume that the voters act based on estimated or
even completely wrong beliefs. One such heuristic is derived by Osborne and Rubinstein’s sampling
equilibrium [OR03], where each voter estimates candidates’ scores based on a small random sample
of other voters. That is, even with a large population when voters compute their beliefs based on
limited information, there is a non-negligible fraction of voters who believe they are pivotal.
2Non-probabilistic uncertainty: Other models stir away from probability calculations and
consider other voters’ heuristics, based on dominated actions, minmax outcomes or regret [Ald93,
FF75, MLR14, Mer81]. The margin of victory plays a major role in the voter’s perceived pivotality.
Controlled experiments on voters’ response to poll information show that strategic voting is more
frequent when the winning margin is small [MGT20, FF75]. [FLMG19] show that voters’ actions are
more consistent with various heuristics based on the margin than with ‘rational’ utility maximization
models. The key point in these models is that voters form a heuristic belief of their pivotality
based on the voting profile, and that an ‘equilibrium’ means the belief justifies itself, not that it is
necessarily correct [Ald93, Mei18].
Analyzing every such model separately would be tedious and leave us with an isolated set of narrow
results. Instead, we identify the main factors common to all of these models, and suggest a flexible
frameworkthatcapturesawiderangeofpossiblerationalandboundedly-rationalbehaviours,without
committing to one model in particular.1 We still consider that the voters seek to maximize their own
expected utility as in the calculus of voting model (Eq. (1)). However, in contrast to the calculus
of voting model, in our model voters decide to abstain based on heuristically estimated perceived
pivotality. This estimate is also a function of the margin of victory as in the latter models we
mentioned. Our proposed heuristic model for computation of perceived pivotality is inline both
with empirical [EGK07, FP96] and experimental [Bla00, FLMG19] findings, and with the models
developed therein that aim to explain high turnout in elections.
We emphasize here that we do not claim to provide a new universal model of strategic voting. Rather,
we want to capture a broad class of models that share similar properties (dependency on margin and
population size) in order to provide results that are not model-specific.
Contributions We show that the set of equilibrium points induced by proposed abstention model
consists of equilibrium points predicted by the fully rational (such as calculus of voting) model that
satisfy Condorcet’s Jury Theorem (CJT) and some more non-trivial equilibrium points. Our results
show that there are non-trivial equilibria where the popular candidate is more likely to win, but
the winning probability is bounded away from 1. This probability, perhaps surprisingly, depends
only on the distribution of voting costs in the population. The bottom line of this paper is the
result that under a plausible abstention model, induced non-trivial equilibrium points evade both;
Down’s paradox of voting (only a small fraction of homogeneous voters vote) as well as CJT (the
win probability of popular candidate approaches 1).
2 Model
We study a two-candidate (referred to as A and B) election with N voters. Each voter is either
a supporter of A (prefers candidate A, i.e. A ≻ B) or a supporter of B. We adopt the classical
i
calculus of voting model as follows. We denote as c := max{0, Gi−Di} the effective cost of voting for
voter i with G , D and V as defined in Eq. (1).
i Vi
i i i
The core supporters (voters with zero effective voting cost) derive more utility from voting for their
preferred candidate than costs incurred in participating in the voting process. Voters with non-zero
effective costs, on the other hand, vote only if the perceived pivotality of their vote exceeds the
1Although some of our theoretical results make stronger assumptions for technical reasons.
3voting cost. For mathematical convenience, we normalize the effective cost of voting to lie between 0
and 1.
We consider the effective cost of voting and the preference of voter i as an independent sample from
a commonly known joint distribution D over [0,1]×{A,B} and is denoted by tuple (c ,T ). We
i i
assume that D has no atoms, expect possibly at c = 0 and/or c = 1.
Without loss of generality, we assume that (weakly) more voters support A in expectation.
We therefore consider A as the “better” or “popular” candidate, and see the outcome where A is
elected as preferable.
As discussed above, Condorcet Jury Theorem states that if all voters vote, the probability that A
wins goes to 1 as the number of voters grows. However, this is clearly not always true if A voters are
more likely abstain than B voters. This, in turn, may depend both on individual voters’ costs, and
on voters’ perceived pivotality (which we assume to be the same for all voters).
Perceived pivotality In the discussion above, we highlighted that the two most important factors
that voters use to determine the probability of various outcome are (1) the size of voting population,
n; and (2) the margin, m. Our simplifying assumption (following e.g. [MW93]) is that voters only
consider n and m as expected values. Thus, a general pivotality model is specified by a function
p, which maps any pair of n and m to a pivot probability p(n,m) ∈ [0,1], and is continuous and
non-increasing in both parameters. We later provide several concrete pivotality models, which can
either approximate the real pivot probability or reflect subjective beliefs.
Support functions While D contains all necessary information regarding the distribution of costs
in the population, we would like to present costs in a more intuitive way.
For T ∈ {A,B} let s : [0,1] → [0,1] be continuous, non-decreasing function, where s (c) should be
T T
read as the fraction of the entire population (except voter i) that prefers T and has individual cost
at most c. We call s the support function of T, and note that it does not depend on the identity of
T
voter i.
Proposition 1. Any distribution D induces a unique pair of support functions s ,s with s (1)+
A B A
s (1) = 1, and vice-versa.
B
Issues and Elections
An issue is a triple I = (s ,s ,p), i.e. it describes the support in the population for the two possible
A B
decisions A and B on the issue, as well as the perceived pivotality of voters on that issue.
An issue does not yet induce a valid game, since the set of players is not well defined. An Election
E = (I,N) is an issue I together with a specific number of players N, who are assumed to be
sampled i.i.d. from distribution D (or, equivalently, from the support functions).
An election is therefore a game, where the type of each voter/player is a random variable. Each
player has two actions: vote for her preferred candidate or abstain.2 A voter of type (T ,c ) suffers a
i i
cost of c if she votes, irrespective of the outcome, and gains 1 if her preferred candidate T wins.
i i
A pure strategy profile in this game maps voter types to actions (vote/abstain).
We argue that pure Bayes-Nash equilibria in this game have a very simple form, in which all voters
with cost lower than some threshold vote.
2Voting for the less preferred candidate is strictly dominated so we ignore this option.
4Proposition 2. (Election Equilibrium) For a given election (s ,s ,p,N), every pure Bayes-Nash

equilibrium can be described by a single number c ∈ [0,1] s.t.:

c = p(n(c),m(c)),
and each voter i votes iff c ≤ c.
i
For technical reasons we will assume throughout the paper that all derivatives of of s ,s are
A B
bounded.
Denote by C∗(I,N) ⊆ [0,1] the set of all equilibrium points of election E = (I,N).
Proposition 3. Every election has at least one equilibrium.
The proof follows from the fact that f(c) := p(n(c),m(c)) is a continuous function from [0,1] onto
itself and therefore must have a fixed point.
Issue equilibrium An issue can be thought of as a series of elections, one for every population
size N.
Definition 1 (Issue equilibrium). An equilibrium of issue I is a series of points c = (c ) s.t.
N N
∀N,c ∈ C∗(I,N), and c has a limit. We denote the limit by c∗.
N
For an issue equilibrium c with limit c∗, if c > c∗ for all N we say that c is a right equilibrium.
N
Similarly, if c < c∗ for all N we say that c is a left equilibrium.
N
Trivial equilibrium An equilibrium of issue I is trivial if its limit is c∗ = 0, meaning only core
supporters vote. Otherwise it is nontrivial. Clearly a trivial equilibrium is always a right equilibrium.
Jury theorems For a given election E = (I,N) and a given equilibrium c ∈ C∗(I,N), we can
compute the probability of various events. One such event of interest is the victory of the popular
candidate A.3
Formally, we define for a given election E = (I,N) and equilibrium c ∈ [0,1], a random variable
counting the number of active votes for A (and likewise for B):
(cid:88)
V := c ≤ c∧T = A ,
A i i
(cid:74) (cid:75)
i∈N
where {(c ,T )} are voters sampled from D. Note that V is a Binomial variable with parameters
i i i∈N A
N and s (c), and expected value s (c)N.
A A
We further denote the Winning Probability of A in equilibrium c of election E = (I,N) as
WP (I,N,c) := Pr(V > V |I,N,c).
A A B
3We emphasize that we, as ‘outsiders’ to the election, care about the actual probability of the event, which is not
affected by the perceived pivotality model p, once c is determined.
5Finally, for any issue I with issue equilibrium c, we define
WP (I,c) := lim WP (I,N,c ).
A A N
N→∞
We say that the instance admits a jury theorem at c∗ ∈ [0,1], if there is an instance equilibrium c
with limit c∗ s.t. WP (I,c) = 1.
A
Similarly, I admits a non-jury theorem at c∗ if WP (I,c) < 1, meaning that regardless of the size of
A
the population, there is some constant probability that the better candidate A will lose. I admits a
strong non-jury theorem if WP (I,c) = 1.

3 Perceived Pivotality Models
We first describe models where the perceived pivotality p(n,m) represents the actual tie probability
V = V (so a single vote would determine the winner of the election). We present two close
A B
approximations of the actual tie probability that have been used in the literature, and that can be
presented as pivot functions in our model.
Fully Rational models
The first model maintains the Binomial distribution, but assumes that the n active voters are the
entire population,4 as in the original Condorcet Jury Theorem and in early Calculus of Voting
models [RO68].
Example 1 (Binomial PPM).
p(n,m) = Pr (x = ⌊n/2⌋). (4)
(cid:0) (cid:1)
x∼Bin n,(1+m)/2
A later model by [Mye98] suggested drawing the scores of each candidate independently from a
Poisson distribution.
Example 2 (Poisson PPM).
p(n,m) = Pr (x = x ) (5)
A B
xA∼Poisson((1+m)n/2)
xB∼Poisson((1+m)n/2)
Conceptually, the Poisson model is more appropriate in situations where voters can abstain (as the
total number of active voters is not fixed). However p(n,m) behaves very similarly to the Binomial
model, and for our purpose they are almost the same. In fact, both models belong in a much larger
class of PPMs:
Definition 2 (Vanishing Pivotality). We say that a PPM has strong [weak] vanishing pivotality if
lim p(n,m) = 0 for all [m > 0] m ≥ 0.
n→∞
As we will later see, instances with weak vanishing pivotality always admit a trivial equilibrium.
Clearly at the trivial equilibrium, Jury theorems are irrelevant: the candidate with more core support
always wins with probability that approaches 1 as the population grows, regardless of who is more
popular overall. It is not hard to verify (e.g. using Stirling approximation) that in both the Binomial
and Poisson PPMs, p(n,m) = Θ(√1 ) for m = 0, and decreases exponentially fast in n for any m > 0.
n
4The true pivot probability can also be written as a function of m and n: it follows the Binomial model p(n′,m)
from Eq. (4), but where the number of active voters n′ is a random variable sampled from Bin(N,n/N). Numerically
this function is nearly identical to Eq. (4), and in particular it has strong vanishing pivotality.
6Tie-Sensitive models
We saw that even in the rational model (which have strong vanishing pivotality), the case of m = 0
is different, with a substantially higher probability to be pivotal.
A simple and perhaps more cognitively plausible assumption is that voters consider themselves
pivotal if the margin is small enough, regardless of the number of voters.5
Definition3(Tie-sensitivepivotality). WesaythataPPMhasq-tie-sensitivepivotalityifp(n,0) ≥ q
for all n.
That is, if the expected outcome is a tie, everyone thinks they are pivotal at least to some extent,
regardless of the number of active voters.
For example, [OR03] suggested a model where each voter decides whether they are pivotal based on
a fixed number of other voters they sample i.i.d. from the population. This induces a PPM that is
identical to the Binomial one, except that the parameter k is used instead of the number of voters n.
Thus for a fixed k, the ‘Sampling PPM’ is q -tie-sensitive for some q = Θ(√1 ).
k k
k
Another tie-sensitive PPM is induced by assuming a polynomial dependency on both m and n.
Example 3 (Polynomial PPM). For α,β > 0
1
p(n,m) = min{q, }
mαnβ
It is immediate from the definition that the Polynomial PPM is both q-tie-sensitive and has a weakly
vanishing pivotality. One particularly natural choice is when β = 1 (so that the dependency on n is
2
similar to the previous models), and α = 1, i.e. linear dependency on the margin.
4 Characterizing Equilibrium Limits
We begin by characterizing the trivial equilibrium.
Proposition 4. Suppose s (0)+s (0) > 0. Any instance with strongly vanishing pivotality admits
A B
only a trivial equilibrium.
Proposition 5. Suppose s (0) ̸= s (0). Then any instance with weakly vanishing pivotality admits
A B
a trivial equilibrium.
The proofs of Propositions 4 and 5 are given in Appendix. Intuitively, the proofs of both the
propositions rely on the fact that we can always consider sufficiently large population size N, thereby
making p(n,m) small enough.
Next we show that that the intersection points of the support functions form the limiting points of
equilibrium points.
Definition 4 (Pivot Points). For a given pair of support functions s ,s , a pivot point is any
A B
c ∈ (0,1) where s (c) = s (c) > 0, and s (c+ε) ̸= s (c+ε) for all ε > 0.
A B A B
5An alternative justification that maintains full rationality is an argument that is sometimes made about large
elections being ‘more important’, as a possible explanation for the paradox of voting [Dow57]. While this suggestion
fails to explain high turnout in general (unless importance increases exponentially with n), even a modest increase in
√
importance of Ω( n) is enough to justify Tie-sensitivity.
7A pivot point is a cost c such that if all voters with c ≤ c vote then both candidates have equal
i
support, and thus the expected margin at a pivot point is 0.
Theorem 1. Let I be an instance with a PPM a that has weakly vanishing and q-tie-sensitive
pivotality. Any pivot point c∗ < q has a right equilibrium with limit c∗. Moreover, for support
functions that intersect at a finite number of points, the limit of any equilibrium is either 0 or some
pivot point c∗.
Proof. We start with existence. Let c∗ < q be some pivot point of I, and let δ > 0. We need to show
there is some N and some c ∈ (c∗,c∗+δ) s.t. c ∈ C∗(I,N ).
δ δ δ δ
Since all derivatives are bounded, there is some open interval (c∗,c∗+t) where s ,s differ, and
A B
w.l.o.g. s (c) > s (c) for any c ∈ (c∗,c∗+t). Let δ := min{t,δ} and note that by the definition of
A B
pivot point, ε := m(c∗+δ) > 0. Also, n(c∗+δ) = (s (c∗+δ)+s (c∗+δ))N < N. Thus
A B
p(n(c∗+δ),m(c∗+δ)) ≤ p(N,ε) −−−−→ 0,
N→∞
so there is some N for which p(n(c∗+δ),m(c∗+δ)) < δ.
δ
On the other hand,
p(n(c∗),m(c∗)) = p(n(c∗),0) ≥ p(N,0) ≥ q > c∗.
Define f(c∗+x) := p(n(c∗+x),m(c∗+x))−(c∗+x) then f is continuous in the range x ∈ [0,δ)
with f(0) > 0 and f(δ) < 0. From intermediate value theorem there is some x where f(x) = 0 and
thus c := c∗+x is an equilibrium of (I,N ).
δ δ
In the other direction, assume towards a contradiction that there a nontrivial equilibrium with limit
c∗ that is not a pivot point. Note that by our assumption of finite intersection points, and due to
bounded derivatives, s (c)−s (c) > ε > 0 in some interval [c∗−δ,c∗+δ]. Thus in any point in
A B
this interval the pivotality goes to 0 for sufficiently large N, and in particular is lower than c∗−δ,
which means it is not an equilibrium of (I,N) for any N ≥ N.
Also note that if q is tight (i.e. the PPM is not q′-tie-sensitive for any q′ > q) then pivot points
above q cannot be the limit of any equilibrium either, as the pivotality in some environment of each
such point c∗ > q is under q for sufficiently large N.
So we have a rather complete characterization of equilibria, or at least of their limit points, in
every instance. A natural question is whether any of these equilibria are “good” in the sense of the
Condorcet Jury Theorem.
5 Jury Theorems for Pivot Points
As observed above, a trivial equilibrium admits a jury theorem if and only if A has more core
supporters, but this is not very interesting.
Our main question regards the non-trivial equilibria, whose limits are the pivot points. Clearly any
equilibrium from a side where B has more support admits a non-jury (as A gets less than half the
votes, in expectation), but we could still hope that, say, a right equilibrium at a pivot point where
the derivative of s is higher, would admit a jury theorem.
A
To provide an answer, we would need to apply a concrete PPM, so the results in this section would
be limited to the Polynomial PPMs, and for simplicity we also consider support functions with finite
8intersection. By the results of the previous section, we know that every pivot point has a right
equilibrium and left equilibrium, and that (except the trivial equilibrium) there are no others.
We first characterize the rate at which election equilibria c approach their limit.
N
Lemma 2. Let I be an instance with a Polynomial PPM and let c = (c ) be a non-trivial
N N
equilibrium of I with limit c∗. Then c

= c∗+Θ(N− αβ ).
That is, the point c
N
must be at distance that decreases proportionally to N− αβ: not closer neither
farther away.
Proof. We will prove for c > c∗. The proof for c < c∗ is symmetric.
N N
By Theorem 1, c∗ is a pivot point.
Since the first and second derivatives of s ,s are bounded, so are those of the functions n(c) and
A B
m(c) (as per Eq. (2),(3)). Also note that n′(c) ≥ 0 everywhere and m′(c∗) > 0,n′(c∗) > 0 by the
definition of pivot point. We also denote s∗ := s (c∗)+s (c∗) and note that s∗·N = n(c∗).

and n′(c) ∈ [n,n] for all c ∈ [c∗,c∗ +δ]. Moreover, m,m can be arbitrarily close to m′(c∗) and
N
likewise for n′ (the functions are nearly-linear near c∗). We consider only N’s large enough so that
c is in this interval, and so that p(n(c ),m(c )) < 1.

Proposition 6 (Characterization of Jury Equilibria). Let I be an instance with a Polynomial PPM
with parameters q,α,β > 0, and let c be a nontrivial right- or left-equilibrium of I with limit c∗ < q
and popular candidate A. Then there are three cases:
• If α > 2β, then WP (I,c) = 1;
A
• If α < 2β, then WP (I,c) = WP (I,c) = 0.5;

equally likely to win, and at the threshold (including that natural case of α = 1,β = 0.5 mentioned

win probability. Interestingly, this probability does not depend at all on the shape of the support
functions, only on the position of the pivot point.

We can similarly bound σ2, as m(c )2 is negligible,

Finally, we can use the last bounds to estimate the probability of the popular candidate winning:

Φ(rN0.5− αβ ) < WP A(I,N,c N) < Φ(rN0.5− αβ ),
where Φ is the CDF of the Normal standard distribution function.7 We can now easily distinguish
three cases, with a sharp phase transition:
1. α > 2β. In this case, where the sensitivity to the margin is much higher than the sensitivity to
the number of voters, we have that N1 2− αβ → ∞, so
WP (I,c) = limWP (I,N,c ) = 1.
A A N
N
That is, we get a jury theorem as the more popular candidate wins w.p. 1 at the limit.
2. α < 2β. When the sensitivity to the margin is smaller than the threshold, N1 2− αβ → 0, so both
candidates win with equal probability at the limit.
3. α = 2β. This includes the α = 1,β = 1 case mentioned in the preliminaries. Here N1 2− αβ =
2
N0 = 1, and thus A wins with some probability that is bounded between two constants
[Φ(r),Φ(r)].
It is not hard to see that we can tighten the gap between r,r, so in the limit they both equal
r = (s∗)0.5− αβ ·(c∗)− α1; meaning that in the threshold case, r = (c∗)− α1. In particular, this means
that the winning probability is completely independent of the shape of the support functions, and
only depends on the position of the pivot point c∗. Higher c∗ means a larger number of active voters
and higher winning probability of the popular candidate, in the limit.
7As the approximation becomes more accurate with N, the inequalities would hold without approximation for
sufficiently high N and the right constants r,r.

6 Stability of Equilibrium Points
In this section we show that the right side equilibrium i.e. c+ is stable by showing that when the
perceived pivotality is different across voter types, a constant fraction of voters have an incentive to
participate (or abstain) such that the equilibrium c+ is restored. Note that c0 is clearly a stable
equilibrium since the margin is a near-constant.
Proposition 7. Let c ≥ c and c ≥ c be cost thresholds for voters of type A and B respectively,
A (cid:98) B (cid:98)
and perceived pivotality p is given as p = p(c ,c ) = p(m(c ,c ),n(c ,c )). Then for any voting
A B A B A B
instance I with N voters, the best response of voters is such that c = c+ and c = c+.
A B
We provide the intuition of the proof. The detailed proof is given in Appendix. Notice in equilibrium
both types have the same cost threshold and hence the equilibrium points must be on the line
c = c as shown in Figure 1. Suppose first that c > c . In this case, the supporters of A shown
A B A B
in the shaded area (in Figure 1) to the right of c+ are less pivotal and hence are incentivized to
abstain. Similarly, when c < c , the A voters in the shaded region on the left side of c+ are more
A B
pivotal and have an incentive to participate. The B supporters on the other hand will participate in
the first case and abstain in the second case. Thus, the population of participating voters adjusts
itself (i.e. c ↓ c+ and s ↑ c+ when c > c and c ↑ c+ and s ↓ c+ when c < c ) such that
A B A B A B A B
the equilibrium c+ is restored.
The left-side equilibrium, on the other, hand may not always be stable. Consider c” < c− be an
equilibrium with cost thresholds c and c with c < c . Then, the supporters of B are incentivized
A B A B
to participate as, with additional participation from supporters of B, the margin m increases,
increasing the probability of win for B. The supporters of A, on the other hand are also incentivized
12
c
Bto participate. An additional participation from A supporters would mean that m decreases. Hence
stability of c− depends on the relative increase in the participation from each type of agent.

e.g. in markets with positive externalities [KS85]. In our case externalities behave non-monotonically
(positive under cˆand negative above but the results are similar.
7 Inducing Unbiased Participation
In the previous section we saw that allowing everyone to participate may introduce multiple
equilibria, including some where the less-popular candidate wins with higher probability, and where
the probability of the popular candidate to win is bounded regardless.
We next explore a different idea: instead of allowing everyone to vote, we sample a sufficiently small
group of voters (odd n), such that they are all guaranteed to perceive themselves as pivotal, and
hence all of them vote. The result is unbiased voting, but with fewer voters. A small sample size
also guarantees unique, stable equilibrium that favours the popular candidate.
Denote by ε := s (1)−s (1), the expected margin under full participation, so s (1) = (1+ε)/2
A B A
then n ≤ 1/ε2. We then need to select sufficiently small n so that p(n,ε) ≥ 1. In the fully rational
models, this can only occur for a single active voter. However under our tie-sensitive model we have
1
1 ≤ p(n,ε) = √ (9)
ε n
so any n ≤ 1/ε2 will guarantee participation of the entire sample. The perceived margin provides
sufficient information to bound the winning probability of popular candidate; independent of the
shapes of support functions.
We now first consider a single round. This already provides us with a uniform lower bound of 0.84134
on the win probability of A when the margin ε goes to 0. The number 0.84134 is not coincidental
but is the probability that a standard Normal random variable does not exceed a single standard
deviation (See figure 2). Of course, the number is sensitive to the parameters of the exact PPM we
use (as are the results in the previous sections), but not to the shapes of the support functions.
For larger margin, the win probability of A may be either higher or lower, and this depends mainly
on the parity of 1/ε2 (where for odd numbers it is always higher).
Still, we would like to further improve the winning probability. One direction (which we do not
explore in this work) is to sample a higher number of voters in an attempt to balance bias and
quantity. Instead, we will explore the possibility of allowing multiple rounds.
Multi-round voting Note that if we require a supermajority instead of a majority, the winning
probability of A decreases, but not as much as the winning probability of B (see Fig 2). So in the
extreme case, we could just try again and again until we get a unanimous vote. However such an
extreme approach may substantially alter voters’ behavior, which do not even know the number of
rounds.
We can thus limit voting to at most two rounds. Given an expected margin ε:
• Set a supermajority threshold ε′ < ε;
• sample n = n(ε) voters;
13P(noresult) δ
P(B wins) P(Awins)
n # A votes
2 µ
Figure 2: The figure illustrates win probability of the popular candidate in any given intermediate
round. For majority, Pr(A wins) = 0.84134 and similarly for supermajority with margin m×0.3
(shown by orange color) it is 0.7580 (the red area).
• If the first round ends with a margin at least ε′, the winner is determined and there is no
second round;
• Otherwise, we run a second round with n′ = n(ε′) voters and simple majority.
Note that the chances of the unpopular candidate B winning in either round are small, as the first
round require a supermajority, and the second round, if occurs, has n′ > n voters.
8 Numerical Study with an Example
In this section, we extend the theoretical results of the previous section with the help of an example
for different model parameters, numerically.
Example 4. Suppose s (c) = 0.1+c/2 and s (c) = 0.4. That is, B has 40% overall support, all of
A B
them core supporters and A has 60% overall support and a fraction of voters are distributed over cost
range [0,1].
Figure 3 shows the win probability of candidate A under c+ and for a fixed population size of 106
for different values of α. The larger value of α pushes the equilibrium point c+ towards the right,
increasing the win probability of the popular candidate. However, as shown in the blowup box, this
probability is still bounded away from 1.
In Figure 4, we observe that the win probabilities under c+ and c− for respective winning candidates
are significantly different. While B wins with a high probability under c−, A wins under c+ with a
high probability for the same population size. Hence B would always prefer a smaller fraction of the
population to vote whereas the popular candidate prefers a large population to vote. Furthermore,
for a fixed population size, the win probabilities of these candidates under their favoured equilibria
are not the same.
We begin by showing that for large values of N, non-trivial equilibria emerge around the pivot point
and converge to the pivot point as N goes to infinity.

9 Conclusion
OurresultsshowthatundertheboundedlyrationalPPMtheequilibriumoutcomedoesnotguarantee
a decisive win for any of the candidates even with an arbitrarily large electorate size. Interestingly,
the proposed model also captures the equilibria induced in fully rational models (Binomial and
Poisson models) as trivial equilibria. Our boundedly rational model satisfies the property that both
candidates enjoy almost equal support due to disproportionate abstention from their supporters.
The almost equal support for candidates is a result of a trade-off between the following two factors;
we have the trade-off between following two factors. then contested by concluding that agents also
receive utility from the performing the civic duty . a) The candidate having majority support among
high-cost voters faces more abstention. This increases the winning probability of the unpopular
candidate against the popular candidate and b) voters are incentivized to vote depending on how
many other voters vote. Hence, when a large fraction (overall) of voters abstain, the size of the
voting population shrinks increasing the pivotality parameter which causes more voters to vote.
The number of votes on the ballot increases with the voting population, however, this does not
benefit both the candidates equally; disproportionate increase in the support of unpopular candidates
leads to anti-Jury results. It is interesting to see how and if this happens in practice. We also leave
the sensitivity analysis and robustness of these results as future work. Finally, coming up with a
fully rational model that explains both high turnouts and surprises in large elections is an interesting
future problem.

c = p(n(c),m(c)),
and each voter i votes iff c ≤ c.
i
Proof. Let c be the cost value such that c = p(n(c),m(c)) and fix a player i. We show that the best
response of player i is to vote when c ≤ c and abstain otherwise irrespective of her type.
i
If not, say c > c and i votes. Then the perceived utility of player i is given by
i
p(n(c),m(c))−c = c−c < 0.
i i
We note that the perceived pivotality p only defines agents subjective belief on the value of individual
vote and may not be from well defined probability space.
Similarly, when c < c, the best response strategy is to vote as voting gives strictly positive payoff to
i
agent i.8 Since the perceived pivotality is independent of player type, the voter strategies are the
same.
Conversely, suppose there are two values 0 < c < c ≤ 1 such that agents i votes if c ∈ [c ,c ] and
1 2 i 1 2
abstains otherwise. Consider the following cases.
1. c ∈ [c ,c ]: In this case, either there is an interval I := [c,c ] such that agent i votes (i.e.
1 2 2
when c ∈ I) but in this case voting is not a best response strategy for i since c < c, or there
i i
is an interval I′ = [0,c] such that voting is a best response strategy (when c > c). In either
i
case, from continuity of support function we have that the probability measure on at least one
of I and I′ is nonzero.
8Note that as agent considers his vote to be of value p(.), this value is not realized if agent abstains giving her the
payoff of zero.
192. c ∈/ [c ,c ]: We consider two subcases
1 2
• c < c : In this case there is an interval [c,c ) such that the best response of agent i is not
1 1
to vote when c ≥ c .
i
• c > c : In this case there is an interval [c ,c) such that the best response of agent i is not
2 2
to vote when c ≥ c .
i
This completes the proof.
Proposition 3. Every election has at least one equilibrium.
Proof. For any c ∈ [0,1], define f(c) := p(n(c),m(c)). Since the support functions are continuous,
n(c) and m(c) are continuous (by Eqs. (2),(3)). By continuity of p, the function f is also continuous.
Finally, every continuous function from [0,1] to itself has a fixed point, due to intermediate value
theorem applied to f(x)−x.
Proposition 4. Suppose s (0)+s (0) > 0. Any instance with strongly vanishing pivotality admits
A B
only a trivial equilibrium.
Proof. Assume towards a contradiction that there is a nontrivial equilibrium c = (c ) with
N N
limit c∗ > δ for some δ > 0. This means that c > q for all sufficiently large N. However,
N
for any N, the number of active voters n(c ) is at least (s (δ) + s (δ))N = Ω(N), and thus
N A B
p(n,m) = O(√1 ) = O(√1 ). This means that for sufficiently large N, the pivot probability is
n N
p(n(c ),m(c )) < δ. A contradiction.
N N
Proposition 5. Suppose s (0) ̸= s (0). Then any instance with weakly vanishing pivotality admits

a trivial equilibrium.
Proof. For any δ > 0, we should show that there is some N and c < δ such that c ∈ C∗(I,N ).

W.l.o.g. s (0) > s (0), and by the bounded derivatives, the margin m(c) is at least some ε > 0 in

By weakly vanishing pivotality,
p(n(δ),m(δ)) ≤ p(n(δ),ε) = p(s (0)N,ε) → 0
B
as N grows. In particular there is some N for which p(s (0)N ,ε) < δ. We argue that there must
δ B δ
be an equilibrium in the range [0,δ].
Indeed, fix N and let f(x) := p(n(x),m(x))−x. We know that f is continuous, that f(0) ≥ 0 and
δ
that f(δ) = p(n(δ),m(δ))−δ < δ −δ = 0. From the intermediate value theorem, there must be
some c ∈ [0,δ) for which f(c ) = 0, meaning c = p(n(c ),m(c )). Thus c ∈ C∗(I,N ).

Proposition 7. Let c ≥ c and c ≥ c be cost thresholds for voters of type A and B respectively,
A (cid:98) B (cid:98)
and perceived pivotality p is given as p = p(c ,c ) = p(m(c ,c ),n(c ,c )). Then for any voting
A B A B A B
instance I with N voters, the best response of voters is such that c = c+ and c = c+.
A B
20Proof. We prove the result by looking at the best response of each type of voters. Let u (p ,c )
i i i
be the utility of voter i under perceived probability p and cost of voting c. We will consider that
two types (A supporters and B supporters) of voters have different perceived pivotalities p and p′
respectively. We will drop the subscript whenever it is clear from the context.
First, note that since n = n(c+,c+) we have that either c > c+ > c or c > c+ > c . That is,
A B B A
with same voting population as in the equilibrium, either A’s supporters are more in number or B’s
supporters are more than their number under the equilibrium.
Case 1 (c > c+ > c > c): In this case we have
A B (cid:98)
s (c ) > s (c+) > s (c+) > s (c ) > s (c) = s (c).
A A A B B B A (cid:98) B (cid:98)
Hence, there is a more participation from A supporters compared to the equilibrium point c+ and a
correspondingly less participation from B supporters than equilibrium point. This gives p < p+ < p′.
The utility for A supporters with cost c ∈ [c+,c ] (the shaded region on the right of c+ in Figure 1)
A
from voting is given by
u(p,c) = p−c < p+−c = c+−c ≤ 0.
Hence these voters are incentivized to abstain from election.
The B supporters in cost c ∈ [c ,c+], on the other hand, obtain strictly positive utility by voting
B
given by
u(p′,c) = p′−c > p+−c ≥ p+−c+ = 0
Case 2 (c > c+ > c ): In this case, the A voters’ perceived pivotality p is larger than that of
B A
equilibriumpivotalityp+ whereasB supporters’perceivedpivotalityp′ islessthatp+ i.e.,p′ < p+ < p.
The utility of A supporters in range [c ,c+] (shaded region left of c+ in Figure 1) from voting is
A
u(p,c) = p−c > p−c+ = p−p+ > 0.
Similarly the utility obtained by B’s supporters in cost range c ∈ [c+,c ] by voting is given by
B
u(p′,c) = p′−c < p+−c = c+−c ≤ 0.
Hence these B supporters are incetivized to vote.

(candidate A) wins with large probability. The analysis of c− is analogous. Let c+ := 0.6+ε and
note that for large N, the winning margin m(c+) is approximately ε/1.6 and the number of active
voters is n(c+) = N(1+c+)/2 = N(1.6+ε)/2 = 0.8N +0.5Nε. Hence
c+ = ε+0.6 = p(0.8N +Nε/2,ε/1.6)

The minimum on the right side of the above equation is less than 1 for large enough N. We have

(ε+0.6)ε 0.8N +0.5Nε = 1.6 (10)
The following sequence of inequalities
√ √ √
0.5ε N < 0.6ε 0.8N < (ε+0.6)ε 0.8N +0.5Nε = 1.6
imply ε < √3.2 . This gives an upper bound on the rate at which ε decreases as a function of

population size N. Similarly, we lower bound the value of ε using

to 1.6/ N. The last inequality above follows from the fact that c+ = 0.6+ε ≤ 1 i.e. ε ≤ 0.4.

For large value of N, Eq. (11) above gives a tight characterization of the equilibrium threshold point

Using this, we now analyze the win probability of candidate A. For this, we will approximate the
Binomial random variable by the appropriate gaussian random variable. Let, µ = n(c+)Pr(A) and
σ = (cid:112) n(c+)Pr(A)(1−Pr(A)). Note that Pr(A wins) ≃ Pr (X ≥ n(c+) ).

This implies that the difference between the mean and the threshold for A’s victory is upper bounded
by two times standard deviations. Hence the candidate B stands at least a 0.6 percentage chance of
winning the election.

Figure 7: The pivot point cˆis marked by a circle at the intersection of the support functions, with
the two non-trivial equilibria for N = 10000 on its sides (dashed lines). For the upper equilibrium c+,
the probability of a random voter to vote A or B is proportional to s (c+) = 0.414 and s (c+) = 0.4,

respectively. Thus the margin is m′ divided by the fraction of active voters s (c+)+s (c+) = 0.814.

C Additional Numerical results
In this section, we empirically evaluate the theoretical results. We first show in Figure 8 that the
number of active voters in large elections is a constant fraction of the population size. We consider
an election instance from Section B and observe that for a large value of N both the equilibria
induce (almost) a constant fraction of voters to vote. This also implies that for a large value of N
both equilibrium points are nearby, favouring different candidates whereas not guaranteeing any
candidate a certain victory.
Next, in Figure 9 we observe that for the weaker dependence on the margin of victory i.e. smaller
values of α induce smaller equilibrium cost values. For instance, for N = 103 the equilibrium is
c+ = 0.8 for α = 1.5 whereas the equilibrium cost is c+ = 0.605 when α = 0.5. This implies that for
fully rational models, when α = 0 our models predicts that only equilibrium is the trivial equilibrium.

Comparing c− to c+
Fig. 10 shows empirically that
1. The locally popular candidate at c− (B) has decreasing winning probabilities;
2. The locally popular candidate at c+ (A) has increasing winning probabilities;
3. The winning probability of B at c− is always larger.
At least for the third observation we can provide a theoretical justification.

Figure 10: Win probability for different values of N under respective induced equilibria. The
equilibrium win probability for a popular candidate A increases with N whereas it decreases for the
unpopular candidate B.
Proposition 8. For a linear-support, tie-sensitive PPM, and any N, it holds that the winning
probability of B at c− is strictly greater than the winning probability of A at c+.
Proof. Since c− < c+, there are strictly less active voters (of both types) in c−, thus n(c−) < n(c+).
Since both points are equilibrium point, we know that voters in c+ participate iff their perceived
pivotality is at least c+. That is,
p(n(c+),m(c+)) = c+.
Similarly,
p(n(c−),m(c−)) = c−.
Now, p is decreasing in both arguments (for any PPM), thus
p(n(c−),m(c−)) > p(n(c+),m(c−)).
Together,
p(n(c+),m(c+)) = c+ > c− = p(n(c−),m(c−)) > p(n(c+),m(c−)).
Since p is decreasing in m, this means m(c+) < m(c−).
