Analytically, finding the origins of cooperative behavior in infinite-player games is an exciting
topic of current interest. Previously, cooperative behavior has been studied by considering game
magnetization and individual player’s average payoff as indicators. This paper shows that game
susceptibility, correlation, and payoff capacity can aid in understanding cooperative behavior in
social dilemmas in the thermodynamic limit. In this paper, we compare three analytical methods,
i.e., Nash equilibrium mapping (NEM), Darwinian selection (DS), and Aggregate selection (AS),
withanumerical-basedmethod(ABM)viathegamesusceptibility,correlation,andpayoffcapacity
as indicators of cooperative behavior. AS and DS fail compared to NEM and ABM by giving
incorrect results for the indicators in question. The results obtained via NEM and ABM are in
good agreement for all three indicators in question, for both Hawk-Dove and the Public goods
games. After comparing the results obtained for all five indicators, we see that individual players’
