ABSTRACT
Interactions between the brain and body are of fundamental importance for human behavior and health. Functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) captures whole-brain activity noninvasively, and modeling how fMRI signals interact
with physiological dynamics of the body can provide new insight into brain function and offer potential biomarkers of
disease. However, physiological recordings are not always possible to acquire since they require extra equipment and
setup, and even when they are, the recorded physiological signals may contain substantial artifacts. To overcome this
limitation, machine learning models have been proposed to directly extract features of respiratory and cardiac activity from
resting-state fMRI signals. To date, such work has been carried out only in healthy young adults and in a pediatric
population, leaving open questions about the efficacy of these approaches on older adults. Here, we propose a novel
framework that leverages Transformer-based architectures for reconstructing two key physiological signals – low-
frequency respiratory volume (RV) and heart rate (HR) fluctuations – from fMRI data, and test these models on a dataset
of individuals aged 36-89 years old. Our framework outperforms previously proposed approaches (attaining median
correlations between predicted and measured signals of r ~ .698 for RV and r ~ .618 for HR), indicating the potential of
leveraging attention mechanisms to model fMRI-physiological signal relationships. We also evaluate several model
training and fine-tuning strategies, and find that incorporating young-adult data during training improves the performance
when predicting physiological signals in the aging cohort. Overall, our approach successfully infers key physiological
variables directly from fMRI data from individuals across a wide range of the adult lifespan.

1. DESCRIPTION OF PURPOSE
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) captures brain activity in an indirect, non-invasive manner by recording
changes in the local blood oxygenation level (blood-oxygen level dependent signal; BOLD) [1–3]. Prior work has
demonstrated that bodily processes have a close connection with fMRI BOLD signals. For example, slow, natural
variations in respiration volume (RV) and heart rate (HR) have been associated with low-frequency fMRI signals (0.01-
0.15 Hz [4–6]), a band that is of high relevance for studying brain activity and connectivity[7,8]. Therefore, collecting
respiration and heart rate signals during fMRI is important for interpreting fMRI results. Moreover, there is increasing
evidence that the coupling between fMRI and physiological signals provides valuable information regarding brain
vasculature and cognitive performance[9–13]. However, many fMRI datasets lack simultaneously recorded physiological
measures[14–16], which require additional equipment and setup during the fMRI session. Further, even when physiology is
monitored, the recordings can be heavily corrupted by artifacts due to hardware, subject movement, or other sources.
To tackle this problem, previous studies have investigated the possibility of reconstructing low-frequency RV and HR
signals directly from fMRI data. These studies have employed convolutional neural networks (CNN) [17,18], bidirectional
long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM), and vanilla transformer models [19,20] in healthy young adults (<36 yo) and children
(<18 yo). However, to our knowledge, no study has yet modeled aging cohorts (i.e., adults older than 36 yo). There is
strong evidence that the relationship between physiological fluctuations and fMRI may change with aging [21–24],
suggesting the need for models that operate on older adults. Since its inception, transformer models have achieved excellentperformance in capturing short/long temporal dependencies [25]. One candidate approach for reconstructing physiological
time-series from fMRI may involve the use of transformer architectures with multi-head sliding-window attention
mechanism [26–28]. Here, we propose a novel framework that adapts two transformer-based models to the problem of
extracting physiological signals directly from resting-state fMRI data. We find that these models outperform previous
CNN and Bi-LSTM based models on an older (>36 yo) adult cohort. In addition, we examine the influence of age on the
physiological signal reconstruction performance, and find that including training data from older adults yields no
significant age-related performance differences.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows: 1) the Methods section provides a brief introduction of the dataset,
preprocessing steps, model architectures and training details; 2) the Results section presents the RV and HR reconstruction
results; and 3) the Conclusion section highlights the implications and summary of our work.
2. METHODS
2.1 Datasets and fMRI preprocessing
We included 1500 resting-state scans with high-quality physiological recordings from 375 subjects (each scanned 4 times)
in the Human Connectome Project (HCP) Young Adult dataset (“HCP-Young”) and 1752 scans from 571 subjects in the
HCP-Aging dataset, with an age range of 36-89 years old (mean = 58.7, std = 14.3). The HCP-Young dataset was acquired
with voxel size = 2 mm isotropic, TR = 720 ms, 1200 volumes, scan duration ≈ 14.4 min [29,30], and the HCP-Aging dataset
was acquired with voxel size = 2 mm isotropic, TR = 800 ms, 487 volumes, scan duration ≈ 6.5 min [31,32].
2.2 Model Architecture
The two transformer-based architectures in our proposed framework are: seq2one (Figure 1a) and seq2seq (Figure 1b).
Both of these architectures have two main components, a transformer block[25] followed by linear projection layers. The
transformer block utilizes attention to extract temporal features from the input fMRI regions of interest (ROIs), which are
passed to the linear projection layer(s) to predict RV and HR signals.
Figure 1. Transformer seq2one (a) and Transformer seq2seq (b) model architectures. These models take fMRI time-series from
specific brain regions of interest (ROIs) as input, and output the predicted physiological (RV and HR) time courses.
For seq2one, we used a sliding-window approach (window size = 32 and step size = 1), similar to prior window-based
CNN studies with younger-adult and pediatric cohorts [17,18]. For each fMRI window, we predict a single RV or HR time
point in the middle of that window. For each time point, the transformer block (1 layer, 8 heads each with dimension 60,
dropout rate = 0.3) learns to capture pairwise temporal dependencies between every time point within the same window.
The extracted temporal features are then passed into linear projection layers to output a single RV or HR point. These
individual points are assembled into the final predicted signals (235 time points), which are shorter than the input ROI
signals (266 time points) due to edge effects at the first and last windows.
For seq2seq, we also adopted a sliding-window approach (window size = 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and step size = ¼ of window
size) [26–28]. For each fMRI window, the transformer block (20 heads each with dimension 100, dropout rate = 0.3) extracts
temporal information and outputs features for each time point as the same length of the window. We then average the
extracted features at each time point as a means of aggregating the overlapping features. As a result, each aggregated
feature incorporates information from multiple windows that contain this time point, capturing more temporally globalinformation. This aggregated feature is passed to the next transformer block, which has a larger window size. In this way,
the model can leverage fine-grained features and longer-range temporal patterns. After 5 sequential seq2seq blocks, the
final feature is passed to the linear projection layers, which output RV and HR signals that are the same length as the
corresponding input ROI time series.
2.3 Training strategies and implementation details
Four training strategies were assessed: 1) directly applying the pre-trained model from HCP-Young to HCP-Aging, 2)
training from scratch using only HCP-Aging data, 3) jointly training from scratch using both HCP-Aging and HCP-Young
data and 4) pre-training with HCP-Young data and fine-tuning on HCP-Aging data. Models were implemented using
PyTorch. The 5-fold train-test splits of the HCP-Aging dataset (described below) were done by adopting an age-balanced
strategy. The validation set is selected as 15% of the training set scans. We chose Adam optimizer with default parameters
with β1=0.9, β2=0.999, and batch size of 16. The model structures and hyperparameters for CNN and Bi-LSTM were
directly adopted from previous papers [17,20]. For both Transformer models, the initial learning rate when training from
scratch is 1e-4 with decay rate 0.5 and patience 2, and the initial learning rate for fine-tuning was 5e-5. Learning rate was
chosen based on model performance on the HCP-Young dataset. Early-stopping was set to 5 on the validation set. Pearson
correlation coefficient between the ground truth RV or HR and the predicted signals was used as the loss function and
model evaluation metric. The experiments were performed on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti.
2.4 fMRI and physiological signal preprocessing
Both fMRI datasets went through the HCP’s generic fMRI volume minimal preprocessing pipeline, and were registered
into MNI152 common space [30,33]. We extracted 400 cortical ROIs from the Schaefer Atlas [34], 25 subcortical ROIs from
the Melbourne Atlas [35] and the Ascending Arousal Network Atlas [36] and 72 white matter ROIs from the Pandora Tractseg
Atlas with a 0.95 threshold [37]. We further detrended the ROIs’ time courses, bandpass filtered at 0.01 - 0.15 Hz, temporally
resampled both datasets to 1.44 s and z-normalized each ROI’s time course. The temporal downsampling step was carried
out to more closely match fMRI data with conventional (typically > 1s) sampling interval (TR), and because the low-
frequency oscillations in BOLD and RV/HR signals fall primarily within a frequency band that is adequately sampled by
this rate. The physiological recordings of both the HCP-Young and HCP-Aging datasets were sampled at 400 Hz. RV was
calculated as the standard deviation of a 6 s window centered at each TR, and HR was calculated in the same time window
as the inverse of the mean inter-beat-interval. RV and HR were detrended, band-pass filtered (0.01 – 0.15 Hz) to extract
low-frequency fluctuations, linearly resampled to 1.44 s, and z-normalized.
3. RESULTS

Overall, seq2one, when pretraining on the HCP-Young dataset and fine-tuning on the HCP-Aging dataset, achieved the
best performance for RV reconstruction, and seq2seq achieved the best performance for HR reconstruction with the same
training strategy. Notably, these models have fewer parameters than the Bi-LSTM model. Directly applying the pretrained
model from HCP-Young data on the HCP-Aging data yielded the worst performance, indicating a domain shift between
the young and old dataset. Training the model from scratch using HCP-Aging data yielded moderate performance,indicating that the model can effectively learn features from the aging group. Compared to training using only HCP-Aging
data, jointly training from scratch with both HCP-Young and Aging data has comparable or decreased performance when
reconstructing RV.

signals. Pearson correlation (r) between predicted and measured signals is also provided. The proposed frameworks effectively learn to
predict many prominent features in these physiological time series.
Figure 3. Performance across 3 age groups in the HCP-Aging data, for the indicated models.
When directly applying the Bi-LSTM model trained on HCP-Young dataset to the HCP-Aging dataset (without retraining),
we observed a slight age-related decrease in model accuracy in older adults. Yet, when HCP-Aging data was included in
the training set, no decreasing trend was found across different age groups (Fig. 3). This result may suggest that age-related
information may be learned from the fMRI time courses without the explicit input of chronological age.
4. CONCLUSION
This work advances the ability to infer low-frequency cardiac and respiratory fluctuations directly from brain fMRI data.
In a dataset from adults spanning a wide age range (36-89 years), the proposed transformer-based framework outperformed
prior state-of-the-art on this task[17,19]. Further, the median performances on older adults (~0.6-0.7) are comparable to, or
exceed, the performance on younger adults reported in prior studies [20]. Our experiments also revealed that leveraging
additional data from young adults to pre-train the model, followed by fine-tuning with data from older adults, was helpful
for capturing specific characteristics of the aging population. Overall, these methods allow for characterizing physiological
components of fMRI data in older adults, and for investigating age-related changes in brain-body interaction and brain
vascular health, in the common scenario of missing or corrupted physiological recordings.
New/breakthrough work to be presented: We proposed new frameworks with Transformer-based models to predict
low-frequency cardiac and respiratory fluctuations from fMRI signals. Further, as the experiments in prior studies were
limited to neuroimaging data from younger individuals (36 years and younger), this study presents a novel investigation
into the older spectrum of the adult lifespan (ages 36-89), hence broadening the ability to model physiological features
from fMRI.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
