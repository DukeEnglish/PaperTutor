not be symmetric. We prove, however, that if a symmetric critical
point exists, those adjacent to it are generically symmetry break-

1. Introduction
Suppose given a finite group1 G acting on a vector space V, and let
f : V → R be a smooth G-invariant function. The largest subgroup
G ≤ G fixing a point x ∈ V is called the isotropy group and is gen-

erally used as a means of measuring symmetry. If f is strictly convex,
we may average over G and so find that, if attained, the minimum c
must be fixed by all group elements, giving G = G. For nonconvex
c
functions, however, symmetry of minima and critical points may break
arbitrarily, allowing in particular for trivial isotropy groups. In this
article, we develop methods to rigorously establish the occurrence of
symmetry breaking (SB) critical points having large isotropy groups.
Grantedtheexistenceofasymmetriccriticalpointc ∈ V, theapproach
proceeds by constructing arcs that emanate from c and inherit some of
its symmetries. A critical point hit by the arc must then be at least as
symmetric as the arc; hence SB. The significance of such phenomena,
as demonstrated in the paper, lies in the fact that, when present, SB
makes possible the use of powerful methods for studying the tractabil-
ity of nonconvex problems and allows for an efficient organization of
an otherwise highly complex set of critical points.
In general terms, this article developed out of a program to under-
standwhythehighlynonconvexlosslandscapesinvolvedinthetraining
of neural networks on natural distributions can be efficiently minimized
using local optimization methods. However, the determination of sym-
metry and stability of critical points is an issue central to several scien-
tific areas. The paper is thus intended for a general machine learning
and mathematical optimization readership, as well as theoretical physi-
cists interested in the theory of neural networks. Our presentation has
been organized accordingly to include substantial preliminary sections
aimed at introducing the relevant concepts as necessary.
2. Main results: symmetry breaking critical points
A formal discussion of our results requires some familiarity with dif-
ferential topology. We defer detailed statements to later sections after
the relevant notions have been introduced and, for now, emphasize a
high-level informal overview of the results: those related to the mathe-
matical mechanism accounting for the occurrence of SB critical points
are presented in this section, those pertaining to the use of SB in the
study of invariant nonconvex problems in Section 3.
1Most of what we say applies to compact Lie group, see [1].SYMMETRY & CRITICAL POINTS 3
The general strategy indicated earlier for relating the symmetry of a
critical point c to those adjacent to it is implemented by constructing
arcs that describe points where the level sets of a given function lie
tangential to S (r), the radius-r sphere centered at c.
c
Definition 2.1 (Tangency sets and arcs). Let f : Rd → R be a C1
function.
(1) The set of critical points of f is denoted by
Σ(f) := {x ∈ Rd | Df(x) = 0}.
(2) The tangency set of f relative to c ∈ Rd is defined by
(cid:48) (f) := {x ∈ Rd | D f(x)(x−c) = D f(x)(x−c) ,i,j ∈ [d]}.
c i j j i
In particular, Σ(f) ⊆ (cid:48) (f).
c
(3) A tangency arc relative to c ∈ Rd is a continuous curve γ : [0,ϵ) →
Rd, ϵ > 0, satisfying γ(0) = c and γ(t) ∈ (cid:48) (f)\{c} otherwise.
c
ByasimpleLagrangianmultipliersargument,anyminimizeroff|
Sc(r)
satisfies the condition stated in (2) above, and so by compactness the
tangency set is never empty. The topology of the tangency set, how-
ever, can be quite complicated for arbitrary C1 functions. We begin
by considering homogeneous quadratic polynomials, where the tan-
gency set has a particularly simple form. If f : Rd → R is given by
f(x) = x⊤Ax/2, A a symmetric matrix, then relative to c = 0,
(cid:48) (f) = {x ∈ Rd | ∃η ∈ R,Ax = ηx}, (1)
0
comprising the origin and all Hessian eigenvectors. This simple exam-
ple illustrates how the tangency set may be locally constrained by the
derivatives of f, here the spectral properties of the Hessian (assuming
now C2). Further information on the tangency set may and shall be
extracted by accounting for constraints involving higher-order deriva-
tives, collectively referred to as tangency equations, see Definition 4.26.
For example, if k ≥ 3 and p is a k-degree homogeneous polynomial,
then (cid:48) (p)\{0} is the set of all tensor eigenvectors (specifically, non-
0
normalized E-eigenvectors [2]) of Dkp(0).
Referring to (1), if A = I , then (cid:48) (f) = Rd and so despite c = 0
d 0
being highly symmetric (fixed by any linear group action), points of
trivial isotropy exist in the tangency set (abundantly so). This might
seem discouraging in view of our general plan to argue about the struc-
ture of critical points via the tangency set. However, the situation for
(cid:48) (f) is unstable in the sense that in any arbitrarily small neighbor-

hood of f, almost every function has exactly 2d Hessian eigenvectors of
norm one. The latter statement presupposes a choice of topology on a4 YOSSI ARJEVANI

suitable function space. We defer formal definitions to Section 4.1 and
assume for now an intuitive notion of a function’s neighborhood. An
assertion holding for an open and dense set with respect to the chosen
topology is said to be generic.
The example described illustrates our general approach, drawing on
ideas originating from the work of Whitney, Thom and Mather: we
restrict to a class of functions that facilitates a complete classification
of all tangency sets—yet generic. The approach allows us to provide
detailed results that are characteristic of functions invariant under a
given group action and are robust under perturbations. We carry out
this program for a number of group representations, emphasizing per-
mutation representations, see Section 5.1. In the absence of symmetry,
we have the following general result.
Theorem (Informal, no symmetry). Generically, the tangency set of
a smooth function on Rd consists of 2d tangency arcs, each tangential
to a Hessian eigenspace.

The function h is invariant under (x,y) (cid:55)→ (y,x), x (cid:55)→ −x and y (cid:55)→
−y, hence B -invariant. Computing, we find that h has nine critical

points to which they connect (see also Figure 2). Additional properties
holding in the general situation are as follows.

it is natural to ask whether the tangency set of a smooth function f
satisfying T4(f) = h can be related to the former in terms of structure

and symmetry. The general investigation of questions of this nature
originatedfromthestudyofsingularitiesofmaps. Oftheseveralequiv-
alence relations available in singularity theory, a natural choice in our
context is the isotopic equivalence and its extension to the equivari-
ant category [3]. As earlier, we defer formal definitions to Section 4.1,
and content ourselves with an intuitive use of the concept. Thus, two
tangency sets are equivalent if one can be continuously deformed into
the other—equivariantly so. A smooth function is said to be finitely
determined if its tangency set is equivalent to one associated with one
of its Taylor polynomials. We typically do not pursue the minimal such
degree.

Reducing the characterization of a tangency set to that of a finite
model given by the Taylor polynomial, we may now determine the
admissible isotropy groups persisting under perturbations. The follow-
ing holds for the defining representation (Rd,S ) of S , the symmetric

(Rd,S )-tangency sets are conjugated to S ×S , q = 0,...,⌊d⌋.

The result is related to ones concerning the irreducible standard
representation of S , see Section 5.4. A notable distinction is that here

a tangency arc exhibiting the same isotropy as c may indeed exist and

The admissible isotropy groups predicted by our theory align with

there is nothing special about the ReLU activation—the results hold
generically for (M(d,d),S )-invariant functions. An additional funda-

is that of tensor decomposition problems [12]. As in the case of ReLU,
certain identifiability also applies in the latter in the sense that the set

We conclude this section with a general remark following [16, Sec-
tion 5]. If we may engage in some wild speculation, let us assume that
nature generates labels by an unknown neural network yielding sym-
metric global solutions for a choice of loss function. The mathematical
mechanism introduced in this work then suggests that the optimiza-
tion landscape associated with the training of a neural network would
generically exhibit SB critical points. SB implies strict structural con-
straints on critical points and dynamics (see Section 3), in particular

3. Applications
WepresentseveralapplicationsdemonstratingtheuseofSBinstudy-
ing invariant nonconvex optimization problems. Some of the applica-
tions have appeared in previous work; others are novel. Throughout,
we work over standard Euclidean spaces.
3.1. Hessian, Gauss-Newton and group representation theory.
SB simplifies, in many cases enables, an explicit computation of the
Hessian spectrum by making possible the use of methods from group
representation theory, see e.g., [17, Section XII] and Section 5.1.
Given two representations (V,G) and (W,G), a map A : V → W is
called G-equivariant if A(gv) = gA(v), for all g ∈ G,v ∈ V. If A is
linear and equivariant, we say that A is a G-map. Invariant functions
f : V → R naturally provide examples of equivariant maps. Thus the
gradient ∇f is a G-equivariant self map of Rd, and if c is a critical
point of ∇f then x (cid:55)→ ∇2f(c)x is a G -map. The equivariance of
c
the Hessian is the key ingredient that allows us to study the Hessian
spectrum at SB critical points and local minima.
Everyrepresentation(Rn,G)canbewrittenuniquely, uptoorder, as
an orthogonal direct sum ⊕ V , where each (V ,G) is an orthogonal

and (V ,G) is isomorphic to (V ,G) if and only if i′ = i. The sub-

spaces V are not uniquely determined if p > 1. If there are m dis-

(Rn,G) may be represented by the sum p v +···+p v , where p ≥ 1
1 1 m m i
counts the number of representations with isomorphism class v . Up
i
to order, this sum (that is, the v and their multiplicities) is uniquely
i
determined by (Rn,G). This is the isotypic decomposition of (Rn,G)
(see [18] and Section 5.1).
The isotypic decomposition is a powerful tool for extracting infor-
mation about the spectrum of G-maps. For example, take G = S .
d
Every irreducible representation of S is real [19, Thm. 4.3]. Suppose,
d
as above, that (Rd,S ) = ⊕ V and A : Rd → Rd is an S -map.
d i∈[m] i d
Since the induced maps A : V → V must be zero if i ̸= i′, A is

In particular, A has most p distinct real eigenvalues. If the
i∈[m] i
isotypic decomposition stabilizes for large d, as with the representa-
tions considered in Section 5.3, the bound holds independently of the
dimension of the underlying space.
Consider, for example, (Rd,S ). In the general theory, each irre-

the Gauss-Newton decomposition where both terms are G-maps.

ple, regularity conditions (see Property (R ) in Section 4.4) or nearly

not suffice. Unfortunately, for phenomena involving kth order deriva-
tives (k ≥ 3) of Ck functions f : Rd → R, the method described in
Section 3.1 cannot be used directly as dkf is no longer a G-map (re-
c
latedly, note that computing the spectral norm of high-order tensors
is worst-case NP-hard [22, 10.2]). It is possible, however, to obtain
bounds on the spectral norm of Dkf(c) ∈ SymkRd, the symmetric ten-
sor representing dkf in the standard basis, via the operator norm of its
unfoldings. To ease the exposition, we work in this section in coordi-
nates (rather than with symmetric multilinear maps, see Section 4.1)
and assume the standard Euclidean inner product. We have,
∥Dkf(c)∥ ≤ sup{∥Dkf(c)x⊗(k−1)∥ | ∥x∥ ≤ 1}
σ 2 2
≤ sup{∥Dkf(c)M∥ | M ∈ Symk−1(Rd),∥M∥ ≤ 1}. (10)

If f is G-invariant, then Dkf(c) is a G-map from (Symk−1(Rd),G) to
(Rd,G) (the former defined in Section 5.1), and the method described
in Section 3.1 may be used to compute singular values of Dkf(c), or
rather of an unfolding thereof (cf. [23]), granted all choices involved
are orthonormal. For example, referring to (Rd,S ), the isotypic de-

explain how such isotypic decompositions, with the particular feature
of holding for all arbitrarily large values of d, may be obtained.
3.3. Annihilation of minima and χ-sufficiency of jets. An out-
standing question in deep learning (DL) concerns the ability of simple
gradient-based methods to successfully train neural networks. Indeed,
nonconvex optimization landscapes may have spurious (i.e., non-global
local) minima with large basins of attraction and this can cause a com-
plete failure of these methods. Evidence suggests that this problem can
be circumventedby theuse ofa largenumberof parameters. The sharp
analytic estimates of the Hessian spectrum given at SB critical points
allow us to study how the loss landscape is transformed when the num-
ber of neurons is increased. For example, in two-layer ReLU networks
[24], ∆S and ∆(S ×S ) spurious minima are shown to transform
d d−1 1
into saddles; the former by adding one neuron, the latter by two. In
particular, annihilation of minima is seen to be tied to symmetry. (In
both cases, the loss is essentially not affected by this process.)
Of course, a minimum of a function having the same second-order
Taylor polynomial as that of the model studied in op. cit. would un-
dergo the same transition. Generalizing this, and in accordance with
our general approach, our study of annihilation of minima proceeds
by reducing to finite models determined by jets, see Section 4.1. We
say that a k-jet µ is χ-sufficient if any f satisfying jkf = µ have the
c
same extremal type at c as µ. Initial work aimed at characterizing
χ-sufficiency include [25] which focused on real polynomials. We cover
generalizations of the results as well as their genericity in the context
of o-minimal theory in [6, Section 7]. A stronger equivalence relation,
C0-sufficiency, holding for general Ck functions requires the existence
of a homeomorphism h locally satisfying Tkf = f ◦ h. C0-sufficiency
0
was original introduced by Kuo in [26], who later also defined the re-
lated, but generally not χ–sufficient, v-sufficiency [27] (the latter being
implied by our use of ambient isotopy equivalence, Section 4.2). If the
first nonvanishing homogeneous component satisfies certain regularity
conditions, an elegant blowing-up construction employed by [28] shows
that h may be selected as a C1-diffeomorphism. Stronger still are con-
tact equivalences ubiquitous in singularity theory [29] (and see [30] for
a more recent account). However, these are generally too restrictive to
establish genericity in the context of our work.
Once χ–sufficiency of fixed degree has been established for a given
class of functions, critical points may be classified by reducing to (fi-
nite) jets. In Section 7, we carry out this program for the permutationSYMMETRY & CRITICAL POINTS 13
representations considered in this work. Additional representations re-
lated to NNs, such as convolutional layers and residual connections,
as well as subgroups of S given by the automorphism groups of the
d
affine and the projective line over finite fields (see [31, Example 3.4])
are studied in [1] by use of methods from elimination and intersection
theory (e.g., [32] and toric geometry, see Section 4.3). For example,
in [24] Hessian eigenvalues are computed by rewriting their Puiseux
series in terms of the gradient entries (formally, quotienting out the
ideal generated by the respective Puiseux terms). As gradient entries
vanish at critical points, this allows for a direct evaluation of the eigen-
value expressions. The approach is used for studying other choices
of kernels, in particular polynomial ones where the expressions of the
gradient entries quotiented out in the respective ring are simpler, see
Section 7. We remark that additional algebraic relations between crit-
icality, curvature and loss exist and indicate a certain rigidity of the
loss landscape.
3.4. Stabilizing inner products and families of critical points.
Forkernelspossessingcertaingeometriccharacteristics, includingthose
described in (8), a path-based approach introduced in [33] enables the
construction of infinite families of critical points for (5), yielding one
critical point for each sufficiently large d ∈ N. The approach gener-
ally assumes natural sequences of groups (G ) and target matrices (T )
d d
having the the property that: if k − d is fixed, then inner products
between rows of W ∈ M(k,d)G d and T are quadratic polynomials in
d
d and the N variables given by the identification of M(k,d)G d and RN
through a suitable linear isomorphism Ξ := Ξ(d) : RN → M(k,d)G d
(in particular the dimension of the latter stabilizes for d sufficiently
large). Thus, for natural sequences, if the kernel is given in terms of
inner products of its arguments, then we may express L as a func-
tion of polynomials in d and ξ ∈ RN, and so regard d as a real vari-
able. Assuming further that the kernel is definable in an o-minimal
structure (see Section 4.5), the set σ := {(ξ,d) ∈ RN+1 | Ξ(ξ) ∈
L
Σ(L(·;d))} is definable, hence so its image under the (Nash) map
(cid:16) (cid:17)
(cid:112) (cid:112)
V (x) := x / 1+∥x∥2,...,x / 1+∥x∥2 mapping Rd isomorphi-
d 1 d
cally onto (−1,1)d. Each infinite sequence of critical points W =
d
Ξ(ξ ), d sufficiently large, gives a point in V (σ ) ∩ ∂[−1,1]N+1
d N+1 L
which, by the Curve Selection Lemma (CSL), may be approached
by a definable arc lying in V (σ ), yielding in turn critical points
N+1 L
in M(k,d) (uniqueness may be established, generically, by standard
transversality arguments).14 YOSSI ARJEVANI
For globally subanalytic [34] kernels, the entries of the arc so con-
structedmaybegivenbyPuiseuxseries(in1/d). Theseriescoefficients
may then be computed in an obvious gradual manner (sharp, though
not necessarily analytic, estimates may also be obtained for the more
general class of polynomially bounded o-minimal structures). By ele-
mentary results in o-minimal theory, the Hessian spectrum may also
be given in terms of Puiseux series, see Table 3.1.
Finally, a consequence of σ being definable is that local triviality
L
applies and so the topological type of Ξ−1Σ(L(·;d)) stabilizes for suf-
ficiently large d. For small values of d, curves of critical points may
bifurcate, as they sometimes do.
3.5. Deep symmetry breaking. For a large class of group repre-
sentations, for example, those considered in Section 5.3, the Hessian
spectrum is highly skewed at SB critical points on account of the small
number of terms occurring in the respective isotypic decomposition,
see Table 3.1. Qualitatively, the same phenomenon has been observed
across a variety of empirical studies involving different network archi-
tectures and datasets, e.g., [35, 36], and see Figure 3.5. The extent to
which the latter indicates the presence of SB critical points is studied
in [10] for various realistic settings based on the approach developed in
this work. Some of the symmetries involved in the analysis are natu-
rally continuous (Lie). These are addressed in [1], along with aspects
related to dynamics.
4. The tangency set
4.1. Preliminaries. Webrieflyreviewconceptsfromdifferentialtopol-
ogy and o-minimal theory, and fix notation that is used throughout.
In the intended applications, insofar as the local study of tangency
sets is concerned, functions are often, but not always, locally smooth
(C∞). Insomecases, thedifferentiabilityordermaybefinite(forexam-
ple, global minima of L ), and the results hold with the appropriate
ReLU
restrictions.
A second category of the results pertains to the global aspects of
the tangency set, e.g., stratification and local triviality, construction
of arcs giving infinite families of critical points, and connectedness, see
[6, Section 7 and Section 8]. Here, even finite differentiability may
be too strong of an assumption. Therefore, to maintain a reasonable
structure of the tangency set, we compensate for a possible lack of
differentiability by requiring definability in an o-minimal structure, see
Section 4.5.SYMMETRY & CRITICAL POINTS 15

Transversality theory. For introductory texts covering the topics in the
sequel,wereferthereaderto[38,39,29]. Weusuallydonotindicatethe
order of a manifold so as to avoid the tedious bookkeeping. However,
these will always be consistent.
LetM andN bemanifoldsand1 ≤ r ≤ ∞. WedenotetheR-algebra
of Cr real-valued functions on M by Cr(M), and the set of Cr maps
from M to N by Cr(M,N) (the latter being a Cr(M)-module if N is a
vector space). Given a point x ∈ M, a germ at (M,x) is an equivalence
class of Cr(M,N)-maps defined in neighborhoods of x, two maps being
equivalentiftheyagreeinsomeneighborhoodofx. Germsaresimilarly
defined for sets, e.g., tangency sets. A map germ at x mapping the
point x to the point y in N is denoted by f : (M,x) → (N,y). We use
maps from a given germ to refer to the germ itself. For the concepts
involved in our analysis, this ambiguity shall cause no confusion.
If f ∈ Cr(M,N) and r < ∞, we denote the r-jet of f at x ∈ M
by jrf(x) or jrf. We call x the source and f(x) the target of the
x
jet. The bundle of r-jets of Cr(M,N)-maps is denoted by Jr(M,N);
if the source x is fixed, we write Jr(M,N). We denote by Lk(Rm,Rn)
x s
the vector space of k-multilinear symmetric maps (forms) from Rm to
Rn, and Pk(Rm,Rn) (reps. P(k)(Rm,Rn)) the space of k-degree (resp.
k-degree homogeneous) polynomial maps from Rm to Rn. We write
P(k)(Rm) =˙ P(k)(Rm,R) and let P(Rm) =˙ ∪ P(k)(Rm) denote the
k≥0
(graded) R-algebra of real-valued polynomial functions on Rm. Recall16 YOSSI ARJEVANI
that Lk(Rm,Rn) ≈ P(k)(Rm,Rn) by the natural restitution isomor-
s
phism A (cid:55)→ A(xk)/k!, A ∈ Lk(Rm,Rn), xk =˙ (x,...,x), x repeated k
s
times. The reverse direction of this isomorphism is called polarization.
Given a k-degree homogeneous polynomial p ∈ P(k)(Rm), the polar
form of p is the k-multilinear symmetric form A defined by
1 ∂ ∂
A(x ,...,x ) = ··· p(λ x +···+λ x )| .
1 k
k!∂λ ∂λ

Thus Pr(Rm,Rn) ≈ Rn×L(Rm,Rn)×L2(Rm,Rn)×···×Lr(Rm,Rn).
s s
In the special case M = Rm, N = Rn, if U ⊂ Rm is open and
f ∈ Cr(U,Rn), the r-jet of f at x has a canonical representative
in Pr(Rm,Rn), namely, its r-order Taylor polynomial map Trf at x.
x
Thus,
Jr(Rm,Rn) = Pr(Rm,Rn), (16)
x
Jr(Rm,Rn) = Rm ×Pr(Rm,Rn).
Under this identification, if f ∈ Cr(Rm,Rn), then
jrf(x) = (x,f(x),Df(x),...,Drf(x)),
where dkf ∈ Lk(Rm,Rn) is the kth derivative of f at x.
x s
We use the r-jet extension map jr : Cr(M,N) → C0(M,Jr(M,N)),
mapping f to jrf, to define the Cr- and the (stronger) Whitney Cr-
topologies as ones induced by jrf: the former with respect to the
compact-open topology on C0(M,Jr(M,N)), the latter with respect to
the topology generated by basic open sets of the form N(f,U) =˙ {g ∈
C0(M,Jr(M,N)) | Γ ⊆ U}, where U ⊆ M × Jr(M,N) is an open
g
set containing Γ , the graph of f. In the C∞ category, analogous defi-
f
nitions, both topologies, follow by regarding J∞(M,N) as the inverse
limit of finite jet spaces. If M is compact, 1 ≤ r ≤ ∞, both topologies
coincide. IfM isnotcompact, WhitneyCr topologyisextremelylarge.
Nevertheless, the category theorem of Baire is valid in both topologies
(the former being a complete metric space by Baire category theorem,
the latter by, e.g., [40]).
Transversality and stratification. If f : M → N is a Cr map (r ≥ 2)
and P ⊆ N a submanifold, we write f ⋔ P to mean that f is transverse
to P. That is, if x ∈ M and f(x) ∈ P, then df (T M) + T P =
x x f(x)
T N. It is well-known that if f ⋔ P then f−1(P) ⊆ M is a manifold
f(x)
and codim(f−1(P)) = codim(P). We say that f is transverse to P
along A ⊆ M to indicate that transversality is only required at x ∈
A∩f−1(P).SYMMETRY & CRITICAL POINTS 17
Definition 4.1. A stratification X of a subset X ⊆ M, M a manifold,
is a locally finite partition of X into submanifolds, called strata. We
say that the pair (X,X) is a stratified set.
If Y ⊆ N and (Y,Y) is a stratified set, one requires stratumwise
transversality: f ⋔ Y if f ⋔ A for all A ∈ Y. Thus if f ⋔ Y, Y pulls
back to a stratification f∗Y induced on f−1(Y).
Of importance are Whitney regular stratifications yielding local triv-
iality. As the notions involved in the definition are diffeomorphism in-
variants we may invoke Whitney embedding theorem and so assume
that M and N are closed embedded submanifolds of Rm and Rn, re-
spectively. The set of k-dimensional vector subspaces of Rn naturally
embeds (Plu¨cker embedding) into
P((cid:86)kRn),
the projectivization of the
kth exterior product of Rn, as a nonsingular projective algebraic vari-
ety. TheimageofPlu¨ckerembeddingtogetherwiththesubsettopology
(compact) is called the Grassmannian G(k,Rn). For k = 1, one recov-
erstheprojectivespaceG(1,Rn) = P(Rn). Wenotethatconvergencein
G(k,Rn) can be equivalently defined in terms of distances between the
orthogonal transformations that project onto the k-dimensional sub-
spaces.

Remark 4.3. Whitney regularity implies Whitney (a)-regularity, which
in turn characterizes stability [41]. If X is closed and the strata are
connected, the former further implies the frontier condition, namely,
A∩B ̸= ∅ =⇒ A ⊆ B [42, Corollary 10.5]. Moreover, for such A and
B, dimA < dimB [42, Proposition 2.7].
Proposition 4.4. ([43, Corollary 8.8]) If Y is a Whitney regular strat-
ification of Y ⊂ N and f ⋔ Y, then f∗Y is Whitney regular.

(4) If M is compact and f : M ×[0,1] → N is a family of maps such

Cr(M,N) satisfying jrf ⋔ Y, where Y ⊆ Jr(M,N) is a closed

The set of Whitney stratifications may be endowed with a partial
order.

We refer to a minimal stratification (unique) as canonical. Although
a minimal stratification may not always exist, it does for important
classes of sets [44, Chapter 4], notably, semialgebraic and semianalytic
sets.
Theorem 4.7. Every semialgebraic (resp. semianalytic) subset X has
a minimal Whitney stratification X with finitely many semialgebraic
(resp. semianalytic) strata [43].
O-minimal theory. A far-reaching generalization of semialgebraic and
subanalytic geometry is given by sets definable in a o-minimal struc-
ture [45]. Like their semialgebraic counterparts, definable sets Whit-
ney (indeed, Verider) stratify definably. This leads in particular to a
well-behaved dimension theory (see also the fundamental cylindrical
definable cell decomposition).
Definition 4.8. An o-minimal structure on (R,+,·) is a sequence D =
(D ) such that for each n ∈ N:

Notable examples of o-minimal structures are given by semialgebraic
sets and globally subanalytic sets. The latter can be equivalently de-
fined as follows. Denote by RK the o-minimal structure generated by
an
addition, multiplication, analytic functions restricted to [−1,1]d and
the power functions x (cid:55)→ xr on (0,∞) for some r ∈ K, K ⊆ R a fixed
field. Then, the o-minimal structure of globally subanalytic sets is pre-
cisely R =˙ RQ . Additional o-minimal structures may be obtained,
an an
for instance, by taking RR or, by a well-known result, allowing the
an
exponential function RK (and, more generally, Pfaffian functions).

A set X ∈ Rn is definable if X ∈ D . A map F : X → Rn is
n
called definable if its graph Γ is definable. Sets defined by first-order
F
formulae ranging over definable sets are themselves definable. In par-
ticular, constructions such as the inverse of a definable function or the
sum,productorcompositionofdefinablefunctions, beingexpressiblein
terms of first-order formulae, preserve definability. Thus, for example,
if f : Rd → R is definable (not necessarily C1), the set
Xm =˙ ∪ argminf| (17)
c r>0 Sc(r)
consisting of all points where m (r) =˙ min{f(x) | x ∈ S (r)} is at-

{x ∈ Rd | ∃r ∈ R>0,∀y ∈ Rd(∥y−x∥2= r2 (18)
=⇒ ∃s ∈ R,f(y)−f(x) = s2)}
and so is definable (leaving the validation of use of abbreviations such
as R>0 and f(x) − f(y) = s2 to the reader). Likewise, M (r) giving
c
the maximum of f over spheres centered at c is definable. Throughout,
all sets and mappings involved in the analysis are definable when f is.
The proofs are straightforward and so are generally omitted.
We describe several fundamental results in o-minimal theory that
are used in later sections.
Proposition 4.9 (Monotonicity theorem). Let f : (a,b) → R be a
definable function, −∞ ≤ a < b ≤ ∞, and k ∈ N fixed. There are
a ,...,a with a = a < a < ··· < a = b such that f| is
0 m+1 0 1 m+1 (ai,ai+1)
Ck, and either constant or strictly monotone for i = 0,...,m.
Proposition 4.10 (Curve Selection Lemma (CSL)). If x ∈ X, X
definable, then there exists a definable continuous map γ : [0,1) → X
such that γ(0) = x, γ(0,1) ⊆ X and ∥γ(s)−x∥ = s.20 YOSSI ARJEVANI
By the Monotonicity theorem, we can always choose γ to be Ck. If
X is definable in R then γ may be extended to an analytic func-
an
tion on (−1,1) (a fact used later when polynomial tangency sets are
considered), but this fail in general for RR and R .
an an,exp
An o-minimal structure D is polynomially bounded if for every D-
definable function f : R → R, f(t) = O(tn) for some n ∈ N as t → ∞.
Proposition 4.11 (Growth Dichotomy). Either D is polynomially
bounded or D contains the exponential function. In the former case,
either f(t) = ctr +o(tr) for some c,r ∈ R as t → 0+, where x (cid:55)→ xr is
definable in D, or f ultimately vanishes identically.
Fundamental results in calculus, for instance, the implicit function
theorem,oftenhavedefinableversionsthatmaintainthedefinabledata.
In some cases, like Morse-Sard’s theorem [46], some of the hypotheses
can be omitted. This equally applies to fundamental results in semial-
gebraic geometry.
Definition 4.12. Let E,B be definable sets. A definable map f :
E → B is definably trivial if there are a definable set F and a definable
homeomorphism h : E → B × F such that f(x) = π ◦ h(x),x ∈ E,

4.2. Regularity and jet transversality. The concept of tangency
setnaturallyarisesinthestudyofsingularities(underdifferentnames),
for examples [25, 47, 48, 49, 50]. Our use is different in that we focus
on properties of critical points connected by the tangency set, their
symmetry and stability in particular, rather than, e.g., phenomena
occurring at infinity such as failures of local trivialization.
Our approach to studying germs of tangency sets involves formulat-
ing the problem in terms of transversality conditions on the jet exten-
sion map. As a first natural attempt, observe that the tangency set
can be equivalently defined as j1f−1(Z ), where
c
Z =˙ {(x,g) ∈ Rd ×Rd | rk[x−c | g] ≤ 1} (19)
c
is regarded as a subset of J1(Rd,R) by identifying the pairs (x,g) with
(x,0,g)(ofcoursethereisnoharminassumingf(c) = 0whenstudying

rank. Thus, by known results, a Whitney stratification of Z (minimal
c
in this case) may be given by the orbit types of the action: Z \{0} and
c
{0} (the singular locus). Requiring j1f ⋔ Z yields openness, density
c
and isotopy results for the class of function considered. However, as
codim{0} = 2d+1, this rules out functions having a critical point at
the origin. One possibility to address this issue is to require instead
that j1f ⋔ Z \{0}, but lose openness (density still holds). Of course,
c
formulating the tangency set as a transversal intersection with Z fails
c
to capture the behavior at critical points as criticality at a fixed c is
notapropertystableunderperturbations. Therefore, werestricttothe
ideal of functions C∞(U) ⊆ C∞(Rd), U ⊆ Rd an open set containing
c
c, of smooth functions f with f(c) and df(c) vanishing. Tangency sets
taken relative to other points or functions with finite differentiability
order are handled similarly.

(0,0,0) ∈ Zd+2∩Zd+1, τ does not lie in the (d+2)-dimensional space
c c
to which T Zd+2 (constant) converges. Therefore, Z is not even (a)-

By standard results (e.g., [51, p. 358]), any f ∈ C∞(U) may
c
be given by f(x) = (cid:80)d h (x)(x − c )2 with H = (h ,...,h ) ∈
i=1 i i i 1 d
C∞(Rd,Rd). Thus, we may define u : J1(Rd,Rd) → J1(Rd,R) by

Corollary 4.19 (Stability). If a (cid:48)-regular f ∈ C∞ is deformed into
e
an f˜ ∈ C∞ sufficiently close to f, then (cid:48)(f) and (cid:48)(f˜ ) are isotopic.
e
Proof. By Corollary 4.18, there exists a neighborhood U of f such that
any continuous deformation of f lying in U describes a path of (cid:48)-
regular functions. By Theorem 4.5, the associated tangency sets are
isotopic. □
Proposition 4.20. If (cid:48)(f) is regular and U′ denotes the stratum con-
e
taining j1H(0), then U′ is of codimension d − 1 or d. In the former
e
case, (cid:48)(f) is a one dimensional manifold. In the latter, a union of
finitely many connected one-dimensional manifolds with the origin be-
ing a common boundary.
Proof. The first case is a simple consequence of regularity and the top
stratum being of codimension d−1. For the second case, observe that
points giving a minimum or a maximum of f over spheres of suffi-
ciently small radius always lie (cid:48)(f) and so 0 is never isolated. Thus,
j1H(0) must lie in the closure of a top stratum. Since U , being canon-
e
ical, has finitely many strata, pulling back to the induced stratification
j1H−1(U ), Whitney regular, the claim follows. □

what is stated in Corollary 4.20. However, in many cases, especially
when symmetry is involved, obtaining a detailed description of the
universal stratification U (see Definition 4.16) can become quite a for-

midable task. Thus, rather, our study of tangency sets proceeds by
reducing to finite models given by Taylor polynomials. Of course, some
caution is needed with respect to the degree of truncation.

The situation described in Example 4.22 becomes even more pro-
nounced for flat functions (derivatives of all order exist and vanish),
such as (x,y) (cid:55)→ e−1/x2 +e−1/y2 (vanishing at the origin). This natu-
rally leads to the notion of finite determinacy building on fundamental
concepts in singularity theory, see e.g., [53] (and [54] for initial work).
Definition 4.23 (Finite determinacy). Let f ∈ C∞ be (cid:48)-regular. If
e
Trf is (cid:48)-regular then we say that the set germ (cid:48)(f) is r-determined

(r is not required to be minimally so).
Corollary 4.24. If (cid:48)(f) is r-determined then (cid:48)(f) and (cid:48)(Trf) are

4.3. Polynomial tangency sets and the curve selection lemma.
We denote by P(Rd) the subspace of polynomial vanishing and having
0
a critical point at the origin. If p ∈ P(V) is (cid:48)-regular, we may use
0
the CSL to construct analytic tangency arcs γ locally parameterizing
the one-dimensional manifolds given by Corollary 4.20. The defining
equation is
(cid:18) (cid:19)

γ(t)
where η(t) is real analytic. We use (21) to analyze different aspects of
γ, hence of the (cid:48)(p) germ. We may write
deg(p)
(cid:88)
p(x) = A (xk), (22)
k
k=2
where deg(p) ≥ 2 and A ∈ Lk(Rd,R) are the polarization of the
k s
respective k-homogeneous parts. Thus, dp (·) = (cid:80)deg(p)kA (xk−1,·).
x k=2 k
To simplify the notation, we shall identify A (xk−1,·) with the column
k
vector associated by the standard Euclidean inner product and remove
parenthesis when no confusion results.
Definition 4.26 (Tangency equations). Suppose γ(t) = (cid:80)∞ tiv is
i=1 i
normalized such that ∥v ∥= 1 and let η(t) = (cid:80)∞ η(i)ti. Equating
1 i=0
like coefficients in (21), the kth-order tangency equation is given by the
term corresponding to tk.
For example, the kth tangency equation for k = 1,2,3,4 is, respec-
tively,
2A v −η(0)v = 0, (23)

2A v +3A v2 −η(0)v −η(1)v = 0,

If m = 1, the condition simplifies to η(1) = A v3 ̸= 0.

Proof. The proof proceeds by essentially following a Lyapunov-schmidt
reduction and then invoking the real analytic implicit function theorem
(e.g., [55]). We construct a real analytic γ(t) = tQα(t)+t2Rβ(t) with
α(0) = 1 (the parameterization forced by (23)). The equation defining
α,β and t is then
deg(p)

kA (tQα+t2Rβ)k−1 −(η(0) +tη(1))(tQα+t2Rβ) = 0.

Since Qα is an η(0)-eigenvalue, we may divide through by t2 and so
have
(2A −η(0)I )Rβ +3A (Qα)2 −η(1)Qα+O(t) = 0. (25)
2 d 3
We solve for β at α = α and t = 0 by multiplying by R⊤ and ob-
0
serving that R⊤(2A −η(0))R is invertible, and denote the solution by
2
β . We may now regard the lhs of the above as a real analytic map
0
Φ : Rm × Rd−m × R → Rd of (α,β,t), and so find by our hypothesis
on α and η(0) that D Φ(α ,β ,0) is non-singular, and so have α

and β as unique real analytic in t by the real analytic implicit function
theorem. □
Besides their use in characterizing germs of tangency sets, tangency
arcs also play an important role in relating the extremal characteristic
of f and Tr(f). For example, for a tangency arc γ(t) constructed in the
c
proof of Proposition 4.27, γ(t) = tv+O(t2), where v is an eigenvector
of ∇2f(0). Therefore, if v is associated to a nonzero eigenvalue then,
for sufficiently small t > 0, f(γ(t)) < 0 or f(γ(t)) < 0 iff T2f(γ(t)) is.
c
If the eigenvalue associated to v is zero, then higher-order derivatives
may be required to draw a similar conclusion. Note, however, that
analogously to finite determinacy of tangency sets and flat functions, a
Taylor approximation determining the extremal characteristic may not
alwaysexist. Weavoidthelattersituationbyplacinggenericconditions26 YOSSI ARJEVANI
on jets, the degree of which depends on the application and the class
of functions involved in the analysis, see Section 7.
4.4. Genericity, tensor eigenvalues and constructible sets. Re-
ferring to tangency equations, for every k ≥ 2, the kth tangency equa-
tion implies that v is an eigenvector of kA modulo terms depending
1 k
on lower-order tensors. The latter statement requires clarification as
there is more than one way for eigenvectors to generalize to tensors.
Throughout, by eigenvectors we mean E-eigenvectors [2]. For v , being
1
unit, this reads
kA vk−1 = η(k−2)v . (26)
k 1 1
In particular, η(k−2) = kA vk. We say that η(k−2) is regular if 0 is a
k 1
regular value of the map x (cid:55)→ kA xk−1 − η(k−2)x on the unit sphere.
k
In particular, to any regular eigenvalue there correspond finitely many
eigenvectors.
We are interested in the situations where conditions equvalent to the
hypotheses of Proposition 4.27 are generic.
Definition 4.28 (Property (R )). We say that p ∈ P(Rd) satisfies
1,2 0
Property (R ) if any eigenvalue of D3p(0) restricted to an eigenspace
1,2
of D2p(0) is regular.
Remarks 4.29. 1) A related approach, mentioned also in Section 3.3, is
given by a powerful blowing-up construction used in [28]. However, the
critical assumption on the first nonvanishing homogeneous component
being regular on its zero set does not hold in the intended applications.
In addition, our goal is different in that we aim for isotopy equivalence.
2) Generalizations of Property (R ) to ones involving v ,i > 1 and
1,2 i
tangency equations to order kth, k ≥ 3, are considered in Section 6 and
[1], and may also be formulated in terms of projective varieties inter-
secting transversely.
Related to Property (R ), there is the question of estimating the
1,2
number of tensor eigenvalues. The question has been addressed in [32]
byuseofelementarypropertiesofconstructiblesetsandtoricgeometry.
It is proved that if a tensor (not necessarily symmetric) has a finite
number of eigenvalues, possibly complex, then their number counted
with multiplicity is ((k − 1)d − 1)/(k − 2) (op. cit., Theorem 1.2).
We repeat the part of the proof involving constructible sets as a way
to introduce the topic (the preliminary section is quite long as it is).
A subset X of Cn (or Pn) is constructible if it is a finite union of
sets defined by conditions of the form p = 0 and q ̸= 0, p and q
polynomials. If A is an order-k tensor, not necessarily symmetric, theSYMMETRY & CRITICAL POINTS 27
setofalleigenvaluescanbegivenbytheprojectionofthesetcomprising
all eigenpairs (x,η), constructible by (26), on the η-coordinate and is
therefore constructible by Chevalley’s theorem. In particular, the set of
tensoreigenvaluesiseitherfiniteorcofinite. Forsymmetrictensors, the
set of eigenvalues is exactly the set of critical values of (x (cid:55)→ Axk)| ,
S
and is therefore finite being a set of measure zero by Morse-Sard’s
theorem. Consequently, the number of real η(k−2) satisfying (26) is
always bounded by ((k −1)d −1)/(k −2) (op. cit., Theorem 5.5).
Proposition 4.30. If E is a subspace of Pk(Rd) ,k ≥ 3, then the set
0
X of all p ∈ E satisfying Property (R ) is open in E, and if X is not
1,2
empty then X is dense in E.
Proof. Let E = E ⊗ C ⊆ Pk(Cd) denote the complexification of E,
R 0
and X the set of all p ∈ E satisfying Property (R ). We identify E
1,2
with the R-subspace E ⊗ 1 ⊆ E. That X and X are open follows for
R
example by the number of symmetric tensor eigenvalues being finite, as
well as standard results from (symmetric) matrix perturbation theory.
To argue that X is constructible, we proceed similarly to the de-
finable case expressing it in terms of first-order formulae ranging over
constructible sets. We may restrict to orthogonal matrices without loss
of generality. The set A of all pairs (A,U) ∈ M (d,d) × M (d,m)
m C C
such that U⊤U = I (cf. Stiefel manifold) and the columns of U form
m
a basis of an m-dimensional eigenspace of A is clearly constructible.
Thus, X can be equivalently given as the set comprising all p ∈ E such
thatforanym ∈ [d], if(∇2p(0),U) ∈ A thenforany(α,η) ∈ Cm×C:
m
if (α,η) is an eigenpair of D3p(0) restricted by U, then η is not a root
of det[D(x (cid:55)→ D3p(0)x2)| (α)−λI ]. To prove density, observe that
U m
if X is not empty, then X contains an interior point and so, being
constructible, is dense in E. Proceeding now as in [56, Lemma A.6],
since X is open, E\X is contained in an algebraic set of codimension
1. Therefore, by a well-known result (e.g., [57]) so is E\X. □

4.5. Tangency sets definable in o-minimal structures. We cover

o-minimal version of [25].
Corollary 4.33. If f is definable in some o-minimal structure D and
c a point, then (cid:48) (f) is definable. In particular, (cid:48) (f) has a finite

number of definable C1-piecewise path connected components.

of f regarded as a function of the radius for ϵ > 0 sufficiently small
is a consequence of the monotonicity theorem, concluding (2). Finally,
since Σ ⊆ (cid:48) (f), if c′ is a critical point at distance at most ϵ from c
c
then c′ = h−1(ϵ′,x′) for some ϵ′ ∈ (0,ϵ) and x′ ∈ F , and we may con-
i
struct a tangency arc connecting c to c′ by defining γ(t) =˙ h−1(tϵ′,x)
(γ(0) =˙ c). □
Recall that if f is definable then Xm, the set of minimizers of f
c
restricted to S (r) (see (17)), is also definable. Thus, by the CSL,
c
we may construct a continuous definable arc γ in Xm parameterized
c
by arc length. The following simple corollary is key to our study of
χ–sufficiency.
Corollary 4.35. If f is definable, then there exists a tangency arc γ
parameterized by arc length satisfying L(γ(r)) = m (r), and similarly
c
for M (r).
c
Despite the simplicity of the proof, the existence of an arc giving
m (r) is not obvious. Counter-examples exist already for (necessarily
c
non-definable) functions on R, e.g., x (cid:55)→ ReLU7(x)sin(1/x).
If f is definable in an o-minimal structure D, the existence of tan-
gency arcs in Corollary 4.35 describing the minimum and the maxi-
mum of f over S (r),r > 0, implies that the extremal type of c can be
c
completely determined by tangency arcs. If D is further polynomially30 YOSSI ARJEVANI
bounded then by growth dichotomy f(γ(t)) = atα + o(tα) for some
α ∈ R,a ∈ R\{0}.

5.1. Preliminaries. In the sequel, elementary properties of group ac-
tions are assumed known.
Representations. Let V be a finite dimensional real vector space with
inner product ⟨, ⟩ and norm ∥ ∥. An R-representation of a finite group
G is a group homomorphism of G to GL(V), the general linear group
on V. The degree of the representation is the dimension of V. If G acts
by permuting the elements of some basis elements of V, we say that
(V,G) is a (linear) permutation representation. If G acts orthogonally
on V, we say that (V,G) is an orthogonal representation. Usually, we
just say (V,G) is a representation of G, omitting the indication of the
underlying field being R and assume orthogonality.
A representation (V,G) is trivial if each element of G acts as the
identity on V. If (V ,G) and (V ,G) are two representations, the di-
1 2

1 2 1 2
the latter via g(v ⊗v ) = gv ⊗gv . The mth tensor power V⊗m, the
1 2 1 2
exterior powers ∧mV and the symmetric powers Symm(V) are repre-
sentations by the same rule. The dual representation V∗ = Hom(V,R)
is defined by gv∗ = v∗ ◦ g−1,v∗ ∈ V∗, making Hom(V ,V ) a repre-
1 2
sentation via the identification Hom(V ,V ) = V∗ ⊗ V . If H ⊆ G is
1 2 1 2
a subgroup, any representation (V,G) restricts to a representation of
H, denoted by ResGV. If (W,H) is a representation of H, the induced
H
representation is IndGW = R[G]⊗ W.

A map f : V → V is called G-equivariant if f(gv) = gf(v), for all
1 2
g ∈ G,v ∈ V . IfGactstrivially onV , thenf is saidto beG-invariant.
1 2
An equivariant linear map A is a G-map. The gradient field of a G-
invariant function is a G-equivariant self map of V. Corresponding to
each subgroup H ⊆ G is the fixed point linear subspace defined by
VH =˙ {x ∈ V | gx = x,∀h ∈ H}. By equivariance, ∇f restricts to any
fixed point space. Thus, if c is a critical point of a G-invariant function
f then ∇f(c) ∈ VGc and v (cid:55)→ ∇2f(c)v is a G -self map of V.
c
Arepresentationisirreducible iftherearenoproperG-invariantsub-
spaces of V. If A is a G-map then ker(A) and im(A) are G-invariant
linear subspaces of V. Consequently, if A : V → V is a G-map and
(V,G) is irreducible, then A is either the zero map or a linear iso-
morphism. The orthogonal complement of im(A) is G-invariant and
so if A ̸= 0, then A must be onto; a similar argument using ker(A)
shows A is 1:1. If (V,G) is irreducible, then the space Hom (V,V)
GSYMMETRY & CRITICAL POINTS 31
of G-maps (endomorphisms) of V is a real associative division alge-
bra and is isomorphic by a theorem of Frobenius to either R,C or H
(the quaternions). The only case that will concern us here is when
Hom (V,V) ≈ R, where we say that the representation is absolutely
G
irreducible.
The character of a representation (V,G) is the complex-valued func-
tion χ : V → C defined by χ (g) = Tr(g : V (cid:55)→ V). Thus, for exam-
V V
ple, if (V,G) is a permutation representation then χ (g) is the number
V
of basis elements fixed by g ∈ G. The inner product of two charac-
ters χ and χ , being instances of class functions over G, is given by
V1 V1
⟨χ ,χ ⟩ := 1 (cid:80) χ (g)χ (g). By a well-known result, if V is
V1 V2 |G| g∈G V1 V2 1
irreducible then its multiplicity in a representation V is ⟨χ ,χ ⟩. In
V V1
particular, the isomorphism class of a representation is determined by
its character. The degree of V may be computed by evaluating χ on
V
the identity.

metric algebra of V∗. The homogeneous components are given by
Pk(V) := Symk(V∗). If v∗,...,v∗ ∈ V∗ is a basis, P(V) may be

equivalently given by R[v∗,...,v∗ ]. The ring or algebra of invariants,

denoted by P(V)G, is the fixed subalgebra,
P(V)G = {f ∈ P(V) | gf = f,for all g ∈ G}. (28)

Methods for computing homogeneous invariants vary by the nature
of the representation considered, e.g., [58]. For permutation represen-
tation, a natural basis of invariants for Pk(V) is given by orbits sums,
G
i.e., sums of orbit elements, where an orbit is defined by
Gxi1···xi k =˙ {gxi1···xi k | g ∈ G}. (29)
1 k 1 k
with the induced action on Pk(V).
By a theorem of Hilbert, P(V)G is a Noetherian ring (polynomial
exactly when G is generated by pseudoreflections). By a result of
Noether, there exists a generating set consisting of homogeneous in-
variants whose degree is less than or equal to |G|. For permutation
representations, a generally tighter bound exists.
Theorem 5.2 ([4]). If (V,G) is a permutation representation, then
there exists a generating set for P(V)G consisting of homogeneous in-
variants whose degree is bounded by
max{dimV,(cid:0)dimV(cid:1)
}.

The bound was proved in [4] for the nonmodular case and is sharp
as seen by Q[x ,...,x ]A d, A being the alternating group, tautological
1 d d
representation. An explicit construction holding in arbitrary charac-
teristic was given later by [59].
5.2. Regularity and equivariant jet transversality. Just as our
definitionofregulartangencysetsisformulatedintermsofjettransver-
sality, regularity in the symmetric case is formulated in terms of equi-
variant jet transversality. The extension of Thom’s jet transversality
to the category of equivariant maps is due to Bierstone [3] (equivariant
transversality of maps was introduced earlier and is due to Bierstone
[60] and Field [61]).SYMMETRY & CRITICAL POINTS 33
The definition of (cid:48)-regularity (Definition 4.16) follows by first ex-
pressing f ∈ C∞ in terms of the set of P(Rd) -generators {x2}, i.e.,
e 0 i
f(x) = (cid:80)d h (x)x2, H = (h ,...,h ) smooth, and then imposing
i=1 i i 1 d
a transversality condition on {h }. The definition carries over to the
i
symmetric case by simply taking generators of P(V)G instead.

In the general theory, one considers two representations (V,G) and
(W,G), and minimal sets of generators: {p ,...,p } for P(V)G and
1 l
{F ,...,F } for the P(V)G-module P(V,W)G. By the work of Schwarz
1 k
and Malgrange, f ∈ C∞(V,W)G may be written as
k
(cid:88)
f = (h ◦P)F , (30)
i i
i=1
where P = (p ,...,p ) is the orbit map and H = (h ,...,h ) is a
1 l 1 k
smooth map. Thus, jkf factors as
jqf = uq ◦(I,Hq ◦P), (31)
P
whereHq(x) = (H(x),DH(x),···,DqH(x))anduq : V×Pq(Rl,Rk) →
P
Jq(V,R) is an equivariant polynomial map depending on the q-jets of P
and F . Equivariant jet transversality to a G-invariant closed semialge-
i
braic subset of Jq(V,R), written jqf ⋔ Q, is then defined by requir-
G
ing (I,H ◦ P) ⋔ (uq )−1(Q), with respect to the canonical Whitney
G P
stratification. Regularity of tangency sets of invariant functions is now
defined by replacing e with G in Definition 4.16 with the additional
modifications necessary to account for invariant functions where both
their value and first-order derivatives vanish at a fixed point. We write
(V,G), rather than G, when we want to ensure that no ambiguity re-
sults.
Definition 5.3. Let (V,G) be a representation and let U denote
(V,G)
the universal stratification. Given f ∈ C∞ (U) , if j1(I,H◦P) ⋔
(V,G) c (V,G)
U , we say that (cid:48) (f) is regular and that f is (cid:48) -regular. Regu-
(V,G) c c
larity of the germ of (cid:48) (f) at c is likewise defined using the function
c
germ. In both cases, if c = 0, we usually simply write (cid:48)- rather than
(cid:48) -regular. Finite determinacy extends to the equivariant category
c
mutatis mutandis.
By Theorems 7.6, 7.7, and 7.8 in [3], we find that,
Corollary 5.4. openness, density, and isotopy theorems hold for (cid:48)-
regularity in the equivariant category.
Proposition 5.5. Let (V,G) be a permutation representation. If f ∈
C∞ is (cid:48) -regular, then (cid:48) (f) is finitely determined.

Remark 5.6. A significant part of the development in [3] is dedicated
to demonstrating that equivariant jet transversality is well-defined, i.e.,
independent of all choices. That p and F appearing in the representa-

is due [62].
5.3. Stabilizingcharactersoftensorpowersof(Rd,S ). Ourstudy
d
of functions invariant under permutation representation requires the
knowledge of the isotypic decompositions of certain tensor and sym-
metric powers of V . Frobenius’ formula (27) gives a systematic way to
λ
compute such decompositions for any arbitrarily large dimensionality.
For instance, to establish (13) for d ≥ 4, observe that by Frobenius’
formula (27),
χ (C ) = i −1, (32)

α[d] := (d−|α|,α ,α ,...,α ),

where |α|:= α +···+α . As suggested by the previous example, for
1 m
any such α, χ is polynomial in i ,...,i . Characters of multilinear

algebraic constructions involving representations of the form V are
α[d]
also polynomials in i ,...,i and can therefore be given as linear com-
1 d
binations of χ from which the desired isotypic decomposition may

be deduced. The approach, presented in [63], proceeds by establishing
bounds on w(p), the weight of a polynomial p in i ,...,i , giving the

That dimP2(Rd) = 2 and dimP3(Rd) = 3 for any sufficiently large d

arcs as the projection of solution curves bifurcating from the trivial so-
lution t (cid:55)→ (c,t) (compare to [31]), η being the bifurcation parameter
and the Hessian eigenvalues being the bifurcation points. This allows
for the use of techniques from bifurcation theory, such as the equivari-
