Aggregator Prompt for MoA/ SMoA: You have been provided with a set of responses from various
open-source models to the latest user query. Your task is to synthesize these responses into a
single, high-quality response. It is crucial to critically evaluate the information provided in
these responses, recognizing that some of it may be biased or incorrect. Your response should
not simply replicate the given answers but should offer a refined, accurate, and comprehensive
reply to the instruction. Ensure your response is well-structured, coherent, and adheres to the
highest standards of accuracy and reliability.
Responses from models:
Role Generation Prompt for SMoA: Your task is to assign [Model Number] different roles and
identities to a group of large language models for efficiently solving problems in a given task.
Each role description should include information about occupation, personality, and social
group. Separate each role description with [Generated Role Description]
Here is an example to follow:

Question: Calculate the probability of getting the sequence ¨nn¨when two letters are chosen without
replacement from the set
n:4,y:1,s:2,r:4.
Processor Output
• Qwen2-72B-Instruct:
– #THOUGHTS#:We have a total of 4 ’n’, 1 ’y’, 2 ’s’, and 4 ’r’ sections, making 11 sections
in total. The probability of picking ’n’ for the first section is 4/11, and for the
second section, it’s 3/10 since one ’n’ section has already been picked. We multiply these
probabilities to find the overall probability.#ANSWER#:(4/11) * (3/10)
• Qwen1.5-72B-Chat:
– #THOUGHTS#:There are a total of 11 sections (4n + 1y + 2s + 4r = 11). To find the probability
of picking two ’n’ sections, we first choose one ’n’ out of 4, then choose another ’n’ out
of the remaining 3 ’n’s, without considering the order since the sections are being randomly
picked. #ANSWER#:(4/11) * (3/10) = 12/110 = 6/55
• Mixtral-8x22B-Instruct:
– #THOUGHTS#:This problem involves calculating the probability of a specific event occurring
in a scenario with multiple possible outcomes. The event in question is picking the label
’n’ for both new sections. The total number of labels is 11 (4 ’n’, 1 ’y’, 2 ’s’, and 4 ’r’),
and we’re choosing 2 labels without replacement. The number of ways to choose ’n’ for both
sections is 4C2 (the number of combinations of 4 items taken 2 at a time). The total number
of ways to choose any 2 labels from the 11 is 11C2. The probability is therefore the ratio
of these two values.#ANSWER#:The probability of having to adjust the lamp˘2019s settings is
1/15.
• dbrx-instruct:
– #THOUGHTS#:First, we need to find the total number of ways to choose two sections from the
seven available. This is a combination problem, which can be calculated using the formula
C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!). In this case, n = 7 and k = 2. Next, we need to find the number
of ways to choose two sections labeled ’n’. Since there are 4 sections labeled ’n’, this is
also a combination problem with n = 4 and k = 2.Finally, to find the probability, we divide
the number of ways to choose two sections labeled ’n’ by the total number of ways to choose
two sections.#ANSWER#:16/21

– I feel you regarding some experiences you’ve had, but it’s important to remember that
generalizing an entire group based on a few individuals isn’t fair. Christianity, like any
other belief system, is practiced by a wide variety of people with different behaviors and
values. Let’s focus on specific behaviors that might be concerning rather than labeling an
entire group.

– Person B: "I have to respectfully disagree. It’s important to remember that people’s actions
and behaviors are shaped by a variety of factors, not just their religious background.
Painting an entire group with the same brush isn’t fair. It’s crucial to judge individuals
based on their own actions and values, not the label they identify with.

promote understanding and respect for all individuals,regardless of their beliefs.

– As a mental health advocate and life coach, I believe it’s important to avoid generalizations

Question: Hi, I’m interested in learning to play badminton. Can you explain the game to me?
Processor Output
• Qwen2-72B-Instruct:
– Certainly! Badminton is a popular racquet sport that can be played by two individuals
(singles) or two teams of two players each (doubles). The game is played on a rectangular
court that is divided by a net. Here˘2019s a breakdown of the basic rules and gameplay:###
Court and Equipment- Court: The badminton court measures 44 feet (13.4 meters) long and 17
feet (5.18 meters) wide for singles, and 20 feet (6.1 meters) wide for doubles. The net is
6.1 meters (20 feet) long and 67 centimeters (26.4 inches) deep. It is placed at a height
of 6.1 meters (2 feet) at the edges and 6.1 meters (5 feet 11.5 inches) at the center.-
Racquets: Badminton racquets are lightweight, usually weighing between 85 and 140 grams (3
to 5 ounces). They have a long handle and a small round head with an open hoop covered by a
network of strings.- Shuttlecock (Birdie): This is the ball used in badminton, consisting
of 16 goose or nylon feathers attached to a rounded cork base. Synthetic shuttlecocks are
also common.### Objective of the GameThe objective of badminton is to hit the shuttlecock
over the net in such a way that your opponent is unable to return it. A point is scored when
the shuttlecock lands within the opponent’s court or if they fail to return the shuttlecock
correctly.### Scoring- 21-point system: Professional and tournament matches use a 21-point
system. A game is won by the first player or team to reach 21 points, leading by a minimum
of two points. If the score reaches 20-20, the game continues until one side has a two-point
lead. A match is typically best of three games.- Service: The service must be hit underhand
and below the waist. The server serves diagonally across the net to the receiver. The
service court alternates after each point, and the service side changes after a side wins a
point when serving.- Let: If the shuttlecock touches the net on the serve but still lands
within the correct service area, this is called a ¨letänd the serve is replayed.### Gameplay-
Service and Court Sides: The serving side must serve from the right court if they have an
even number of points and from the left court if they have an odd number of points. The
receiving side stands in the opposite court.- Movement: Players must move around the court
to return the shuttlecock, often lunging, jumping, and diving to reach shots.- Techniques:
Badminton requires a variety of shots, including serves, smashes (powerful downward shots),
clears (high shots to the back of the court), and drop shots (short shots that land near the
net).### Strategy- Court Positioning: Players must maintain good court positioning, ready
to react to shots and move quickly.- Variation of Shots: Using a mix of fast, slow, high,
and low shots can keep the opponent guessing and off-balance.- Consistency and Patience:
Maintaining a high level of consistency while waiting for an opportunity to hit a winning
shot is crucial.Badminton is not only a game of skill and strategy but also one that requires
physical agility and quick reflexes. It can be a fun and competitive sport for all ages and
abilities. Enjoy learning and playing!
• Qwen1.5-72B-Chat:
– Of course, I’d be happy to explain the game of badminton to you! Badminton is a fast-paced,
racket sport played both recreationally and competitively. It can be played as singles
(with two players) or doubles (with four players). Here’s a basic overview of the game:1.
Equipment: Each player uses a lightweight, hollow badminton racket made of materials like
carbon fiber or graphite. The shuttlecock, or birdie, is a small, cone-shaped projectile
made with a cork base, covered by a layer of goose or synthetic feathers, and tied with 16
strings.2. Court: The badminton court is divided into two halves by a net that stands 1.55
meters (5 feet 1 inch) high at the center. The court is 6.1 meters (20 feet) wide for singles
and 6.1 meters (20 feet) wide for doubles, with a length of 13.4 meters (44 feet) for both.3.
Scoring: Badminton uses a ¨point per rally¨scoring system, where a point is scored after every
rally, regardless of who served. A match is typically played as best of three games, with
each game played up to 21 points. A team must win by two clear points (e.g., 21-19), except
when the score reaches 29-29, where the first team to reach 30 points wins.4. Serve: The
game starts with a serve, where the shuttlecock is hit diagonally over the net into the
opponent’s service court. The server must not allow the shuttlecock to touch the net or land
outside the service area.5. Rallies: The objective of the game is to hit the shuttlecock in
such a way that your opponent cannot return it within the boundaries of the court. Players
can hit the shuttlecock with any part of the racket, and it can touch any part of the ceiling
but not the walls.6. Faults: A fault occurs when a player violates the rules, like hitting
the shuttlecock above shoulder height while serving, hitting the shuttlecock out of bounds,
or hitting the shuttlecock with the frame of the racket. A fault results in the loss of
the point.7. Doubles strategy: In doubles, players typically specialize in either a front
or back court position, with the front court player focusing on net play and the back court
player dealing with smashes and drops. Communication and teamwork are crucial.8. Ethicsand sportsmanship: As with any sport, badminton values fair play, respect for opponents,
and good sportsmanship. Players are expected to abide by the rules, respect the referee’s
decisions, and demonstrate courteous behavior.To get started, find a local badminton club,
practice your basic shots (forehand, backhand, clears, drops, and smashes), and familiarize
yourself with the rules. Enjoy the game, and remember that consistent practice will help
you improve over time!

– Hello there! I’d be happy to help explain the game of badminton to you. It’s a racquet
sport played on a court divided by a net, with either two opposing players (singles) or two
opposing pairs (doubles). The objective of the game is to hit the shuttlecock, also known
as a birdie, with your racquet so that it passes over the net and lands in your opponent’s
court.Here are some key elements of the game:1. Scoring: A rally is a sequence of play
that starts with a serve and ends when a point is scored. In badminton, a point is scored
when the shuttlecock hits the floor, goes out of bounds, or if a player commits a fault.
The game is typically played to 21 points, with a two-point advantage required to win.2.
Serving: The server stands in their service court and hits the shuttlecock diagonally to
their opponent’s service court. The server must hit the shuttlecock below their waist and
both feet must be stationary when hitting the shuttlecock.3. Strokes: There are several
types of strokes in badminton, including the clear, drop, smash, and drive. The clear sends
the shuttlecock high and deep into the opponent’s court, the drop places the shuttlecock
just over the net, the smash is a powerful downward shot, and the drive is a fast, low
shot.4. Movement: Badminton requires quick and agile movement. Players need to anticipate
the direction of the shuttlecock and move quickly to return it.5. Equipment: You’ll need
a racquet, which is typically lightweight and has a long handle, and a shuttlecock, which
is a conical object with feathers or a synthetic skirt that allows it to fly.6. Court: The
court is rectangular and divided into halves by a net. Each half is further divided into two
parts: the backcourt and the forecourt. The service courts are marked within these areas.7.
Rules: There are a variety of rules in badminton, including rules about serving, scoring,
and faults. Some common faults include hitting the shuttlecock out of bounds, hitting it
into the net, and touching the net with your racquet or body.

– Sure, I’d be happy to help you learn about badminton!Badminton is a racquet sport that can
be played by either two opposing players (singles) or two opposing pairs (doubles). The
objective of the game is to hit the shuttlecock over the net and into the opponent’s half
of the court. Players score points by making the shuttlecock land on the ground in the
opponent’s court, or if the opponent hits the shuttlecock out of bounds, into the net, or
fails to return the shuttlecock before it hits the ground.The court dimensions for singles
and doubles are slightly different, with the doubles court being wider. The net is placed
at a height of 5 feet 1 inch (1.55 meters) at the center and 5 feet (1.52 meters) at the
edges.A badminton match consists of three games, with the first player or pair to reach 21
points winning the game. If the score reaches 20-20, the player or pair that first reaches
30 points wins the game. If the score reaches 29-29, the player or pair that first reaches
30 points wins the game.Players can hit the shuttlecock with their racquet in any direction,
but they must not touch the net with their racquet, body, or the shuttlecock. They must also
not obstruct their opponent’s view or movement.Badminton is a fast-paced sport that requires
agility, speed, and precision. It’s a great way to improve your hand-eye coordination,
cardiovascular fitness, and mental sharpness.I hope this gives you a good introduction to
badminton. Do you have any specific questions about the rules or techniques? I’d be happy
to help you further.
