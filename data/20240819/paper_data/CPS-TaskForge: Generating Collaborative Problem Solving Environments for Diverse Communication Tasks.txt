E PotentialCPS-TaskForgeTasks
We decided to use the tower defense game genre
as the task for CPS-TaskForge after considering
severalothergames.
1. Pandemic™boardgame. Wefoundvaluable
play by forum games that demonstrated the
typeofmulti-turncollaborativecommunica-
tion we hope to see in CPS data. However,
one instance of the game takes at minimum
30 minutes to complete, making it challeng-
ingtoevaluateintermediatetaskprocess. The
lengthydurationisalsoabarriertotaskrepe-
titionwithinasinglestudysession.
2. CrypticCrosswordpuzzles. Thecrypticcross-
word puzzle variant relies on metahints and
wordplay,makingitmoreaccessiblethanreg-
ularcrosswordsthatrequiretriviaknowledge.
However, learning the rules is difficult. Par-
ticipantsrequired2–3hourstounderstandthe
