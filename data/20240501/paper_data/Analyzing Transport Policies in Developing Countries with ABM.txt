B DECISION-MAKINGMODULE
Agents make decisions following the CONSUMAT approach. Depending on the comparison of the sat-
isfaction and uncertainty levels with the thresholds, agents follow one of these strategies: repeat, imitate,
deliberate,orinquiry.

ABSTRACT
Deciphering travel behavior and mode choices is a critical aspect of effective urban transportation system
management, particularly in developing countries where unique socio-economic and cultural conditions
complicate decision-making. Agent-based simulations offer a valuable tool for modeling transportation
systems, enabling a nuanced understanding and policy impact evaluation. This work aims to shed light on
theeffectsoftransportpoliciesandanalyzingtravelbehaviorbysimulatingagentsmakingmodechoicesfor
their daily commutes. Agents gather information from the environment and their social network to assess
theoptimaltransportoptionbasedonpersonalsatisfactioncriteria. Ourfindings,stemmingfromsimulating
a free-fare policy for public transit in a developing-country city, reveal significant influence on decision-
making,fosteringpublicserviceusewhilepositivelyinfluencingpollutionlevels,accidentrates,andtravel
speed.

1 INTRODUCTION
The analysis of travel mode choice holds substantial relevance in urban planning, particularly for devising
strategiestoenhancecitizens’qualityoflife,promotepublictransportusage,andfacilitatesustainableurban
development. Withtherapidgrowthofcitiesandescalatingtransportdemands,effectivepoliciesarecrucial

toaddressavarietyofissues,forinstance,trafficcongestion[1],increaseofprivatevehiclesownership[2],

choice models struggle to capture the nonlinear relationships and constant interactions in complex trans-
portationsystems. Agent-basedsimulationmodels(ABM)haveemergedasavaluablealternative,offering

A few works have applied ABM to analyze travel mode choices. For instance, Faboya et al. [7] analyzes
theadaptivetravelbehaviorofindividualscommutingtoandfromauniversity. InadifferentstudyKangur

The remainder of the paper presents a brief description of the simulation model in section 2. Section 3
describes the experiments and results are discussed in the following section. Finally, section 4 covers con-
clusionsandfuturework.
2 SIMULATIONMODEL
The model simulates the travel mode choices made by urban commuters. Agents are created with demo-
graphic attributes such as sex, age, and income level and then distributed in neighborhoods throughout the
city according to their socioeconomic status. To represent social influence in decision-making, agents are
connected through a social network using a scale-free topology. Preferential attachment is a widely used
model for large real-world networks exhibiting a power-law distribution [13]. In this model, agents con-
nect to other nodes chosen at random, with a bias towards nodes already highly connected. People within
the same socioeconomic group have a higher probability of being connected. This represents the concept
of forming social ties with similar others [14].In a previous work related to this research, we explored the
impact of using different types of network and explained the reasons for using a preferential attachment
network [15]. In the supplementary material, an example of a social network simulated with our model
can be found. The simulation begins with commuters traveling by motorcycle, car, or public transit at the
peak-hour, with the goal of maximizing satisfaction on their journey to the designated workplace. After
completingthetrip,theyassesstravelsatisfactionusingautilityfunctionthatincorporatesvarioustransport

to the results of 970 responses to a survey we conducted in the city selected as a case study [16]. The

accidents, and CO2 emissions vary depending on the number of cars, motorcycles, or buses in circulation.Salazar-Serna,Cadavid,andFranco
Each agent calculates a level of density of vehicles in each time step, counting the number of equivalent
cars in the surrounding patches. The densitylevel affects the travel speed with a logarithmic decrease, and
ultimatelythekilometerstraveled,thetraveltime,andtheemissionsperkilometerchangeaccordingly.
Based on the CONSUMAT approach [17], which is a framework that integrates different theories of con-
sumerbehavior,wedevelopedamentalmodelmodulethathelpsagentsmakeadecisionaboutthetransport
mode. By comparing the satisfaction obtained to a satisfaction threshold and simultaneously comparing
theuncertaintyaboutthesatisfactionthatwillbeobtainedwiththeselectedmodetoanuncertaintythresh-
old, agents implement one of these strategies: repeat, imitate, deliberate, or inquire. The uncertainty is
calculated asU =α (1 %times using mode)+(1 α) (1 %peers using mode); it is a com-
∗ − − − − ∗ − − −
binationoftheirpersonaluserexperienceandtheexperiencesoftheirsimilarothers(peerswithintheirsocial
network). As an extension of the CONSUMAT approach, we introduce this calculation of uncertainty that
incorporates social influence in decision making, taking into account that people gather information with
theirpeerswhenmakingdecisionsunderuncertainty[13]. Alphaisaparameterbetweenzeroandonethat

little previous user experience with the transport mode, she can still obtain information from neighbors on
thesocialnetwork,whichmighthelpreduceuncertainty. Forourmodel,alphawasfixedat0.48,according

Note that the uncertainty level leads to different strategies to make decisions, depending on whether this is

world. Thedecisionperiodforagentstomakeadecisionaboutcontinuingusingthesamemodeorchange

The validation of the model was carried out using the ’validation in parts’ technique [19]. It suggest to
validate separately inputs, processes, and outputs. Inputs were validated to follow the distribution in a real
system. Aconceptualmodelbasedontravelmodechoiceliteraturewasdevelopedandexpertsinsimulation

The distribution of transport users changes with the implementation of the policy. Participation in public
transit drops to 29%, keeping a higher percentage of users than in the base case and avoiding a greater
increase in private vehicle ownership. This is explained by higher levels of satisfaction with the transport
mode, especially among users with low income levels who give great importance to the acquisition and
operatingcostofthetransportmode. Thosemigratingtomotorcycles-themostaffordableoptionforthem
in the base case scenario - stay in the public service when the fare cost is zero. Also, the increase in cars
islowerwiththepolicyimplementation; still, someuserswithgreatereconomicpowerwhovaluecomfort

scenario,anincreaseofupto30%isexpectedforcarsand14%formotorcycles. Figure2presentsthreekey
indicators that show the beneficial impact of the policy on critical issues such as road accidents, pollution,
and congestion. The average accident rate (number of accidents per 100,000 people) is lower when more
users use public transport. Motorcycles are the transport mode that makes the highest contribution to the

mutersindevelopingeconomieswithpredominantownershipofprivatevehicles. Usingcensusandsurvey
data from a Colombian case study city, we conducted experiments using an agent-based simulation model
torepresentthedecision-makingprocessfortravel-modechoices. Thefindingsindicatethattheimplemen-

the policy contributes to an improved average travel speed during peak hours, due to a reduced number of

nevertheless, the proportion of users continues to decrease due to other aspects considered in the selection

work will test a case in a different country. This model serves as a test-bed that can be parameterized for
different territories considering their economic, social, and cultural conditions. We hope that this research
