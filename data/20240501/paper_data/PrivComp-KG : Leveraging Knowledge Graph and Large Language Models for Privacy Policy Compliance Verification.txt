Abstract. Dataprotectionandprivacyisbecomingincreasinglycrucial
in the digital era. Numerous companies depend on third-party vendors
and service providers to carry out critical functions within their opera-
tions, encompassing tasks such as data handling and storage. However,
this reliance introduces potential vulnerabilities, as these vendors’ secu-
rity measures and practices may not always align with the standards
expected by regulatory bodies. In response, federal and international
organizationshaveenacteddataprotectionlaws,regulations,andguide-
linesthatgovernvendormanagementanddatadissemination.Businesses
are required, often under the penalty of law, to ensure compliance with
the evolving regulatory rules. However, interpreting and implementing
these regulations pose challenges due to their complexity. Regulatory

1 Introduction
Every day, vast quantities of data are collected from diverse sources across the
globe. This spans from individual interactions on social media to industrial sen-
sor readings. These collections of data are essential as it provides valuable in-
sightsintoconsumerbehaviors,markettrends,andsocietalpatterns.Businesses
leveragethisdatatotailortheirproductsandservices,optimizeoperations,and

scientificbreakthroughs,improvehealthcareoutcomes,andaddresssocietalchal-
lenges. This evolution coincides with a pervasive integration of technology into
our daily lives, resulting in the widespread collection of individual and aggre-
gated data.
However, the surge in data collection has sparked concerns regarding data
privac. There is potential for misuse and unauthorized dissemination of con-
sumers’privateinformationbyorganizationscollectingtheirdata.Consequently,
numerous data protection regulations, such as the European Union’s General
Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) [29], Payment Card Industry Data Secu-
rity Standard (PCI DSS) [6], and the California Consumer Privacy Protection
Act(CCPA)[1,2],havebeenestablishedinresponsetopublicapprehension.Pri-
vacy Policy regulations impose strict rules on collecting, using, and managing
personal data. These rules require companies to follow principles like minimiz-
ingdatacollection,limitingitsusetospecifiedpurposes,obtaininguserconsent,
andensuringthedataaccuracy,security,andthecompany’saccountability.The
GDPR,forexample,setsathoroughsetofprivacyanddataprotectionrulesfor
companies accessing the European Union (EU) users’ data. Known for setting
some of the strictest data privacy and security standards worldwide, the GDPR
isamodelforproperlyusingpersonaldata,focusingonsafeguardingandlegally
processing individuals’ information. As a result, businesses must reassess how
they handle data, ensuring their approaches comply with GDPR guidelines to
protect people’s privacy while maximizing benefits with data in this digital era.
Furthermore, not adhering to this regulations not only makes the organization

ties.
In May 2023, the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) made a major
move in the history of the GDPR by fining the American tech company Meta a
record €1.2 billion [3]. This fine was the highest ever because Meta moved the
personal data of European users to the United States without ensuring enough
protection for this data. This step by the DPC is a crucial moment in data pro-
tection law, highlighting how seriously rules about international data transfer
are enforced under the GDPR. In July 2021, Amazon Europe Core SARL was
fined €746 million by the Luxembourg National Commission for Data Protec-
tion(CNDP),markingthemostsignificantpenaltyforviolatingtheGDPR.ThisPrivComp-KG: Leveraging KG and LLM for Compliance Verification 3

vacy group La Quadrature du Net, concerning Amazon’s data processing prac-
tices. The CNDP’s investigation revealed that Amazon’s advertising targeting
system operated without obtaining proper consent, contravening GDPR’s strin-
gent consent requirements, which demand clear communication and detailed
explanations of personal data use, purpose, and usage. [25] In September 2023,
TikTok faced a significant penalty from the Irish DPC, receiving a fine of EUR
345 million. This event marked one of the most considerable GDPR fines im-
posed on a social media platform, particularly highlighting issues around pro-
tecting children’s data privacy. The decision underscored the critical need for
tech companies to prioritize the safety of young users online. [28] These in-
stancesunderscoresthecriticalneedforbusinessestounderstandprivacypolicy
regulations and ensure that their data privacy policies are consistent with the
regulations.
Businesses must thoroughly understand the nature, scope, and purpose of
the data they collect, process, and store. Furthermore, this information must be
precisely recorded in a privacy policy document that’s easy for users to access
and understand. Writing a comprehensive privacy policy document is critical
to building trust between data collectors and consumers. Developing a privacy
policythatmeetstheextensiverequirementsofpolicyregulationsisasignificant
challenge for companies, primarily because of the complexity of the regulation’s
rules. Privacy policies are short and concise for user ease while complying with
all relevant sections of the regulatory document. Furthermore, the legal land-
scape of data protection regulations is dynamic and evolving. The GDPR sets a

Additionally, the regulation applies to businesses operating within the EU and

complicates compliance efforts. Companies must navigate GDPR and any other
local privacy laws that might apply. This complicates efforts to develop compli-
ant privacy policies that satisfy all regulatory requirements. The motivation of
this work is to help privacy policy writers efficiently develop a privacy policy in
compliance with regulatory documents.
We propose an innovative framework that enables policy writers to identify

their relevance to regulatory sections, we use Retrieval Augmented Generation
(RAG) to assess privacy policies’ alignment with GDPR articles. This avoids
the need for constant model fine-tuning with evolving privacy laws. RAG helps
generate responses by utilizing chunks of GDPR articles, allowing us to identify
specific segments that match privacy policies, ensuring a dynamic and com-
prehensive approach without requiring continual model updates for each policy
change. We demonstrate the utility of the PrivComp-KG, by verifying com-
pliance of privacy policy documents for various organizations in the OPP-115
dataset [33].
The structure of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we describe
relevant work in contemporary GDPR compliance efforts and LLM RAG meth-
ods for text retrieval. In Section 3, we describe our framework leveraging LLMs

the development of PrivComp-KG and illustrates how data retrieved from ven-
dor policies are incorporated into the knowledge graph. In Section 4 we detail
the utilisation of our framework to verify compliance of privacy policies in the
OPP-115 dataset. Furthermore we describe the results from evaluation of the
knowledge extraction and KG creation methods. The final section summarizes
these discoveries and outlines prospective research avenues.
2 Background and Related Work
2.1 Privacy Policy Compliance
As data collection increases, public concern over privacy risks has intensified,
leading to the implementation of stringent privacy regulations like the GDPR.
These regulations are crucial for safeguarding privacy, yet ensuring automatic
complianceremainsacomplexchallenge.TheGDPRmarksasignificantchange
in privacy laws, setting up strict rules to protect people’s rights and how com-
paniesmusthandlepersonaldata.TheEuropeanUnionintroducedit,requiring
strictadherencefromanyorganizationwithintheEUordealingwithdatafrom
EUcitizens.Ignoringtheserulescanleadtoheavyfinesofupto20millionEuros
or 4% of a company’s worldwide yearly income, depending on the seriousness
of the violation. The GDPR applies to all organizations handling personal data,
regardless of location, and replaces the older EU Data Protection Directive in-
troducedin1995,creatingaunifiedprivacylawforallEUcountries.Thismeans
companies can now follow one set of privacy rules across the EU. [29] Further-
more, the GDPR’s influence has reached beyond Europe, inspiring similar laws
in other countries, including the United States. Given this move towards tighter
privacy regulations globally, understanding and complying with the GDPR is
crucial for software companies to meet current rules and prepare for any new
privacy laws in the future.
In recent research [26], the concept of "Data Capsule" is introduced, au-
tomating compliance checks against privacy regulations in data processing. In-
dividual data is associated with specific policies, ensuring adherence through
residualpoliciesandanewalgorithmforeffectivepolicyderivation.ThissystemPrivComp-KG: Leveraging KG and LLM for Compliance Verification 5
advances individual privacy protection, albeit focusing solely on data subject
rights. Another study [17] proposes an approach to assess privacy policy align-
ment with GDPR Article 13 standards. By manually selecting 304 policies and
developing a labeling system, the authors identify compliance issues, creating
a web tool named AutoCompliance to simplify policy comprehension. However,
this study overlooks broader GDPR coverage. In privacy policy research [16],
theimpactofGDPRonover6,000policiesisanalyzed,indicatingsignificantre-
visions post-GDPR, particularly in EU policies. User experience improvements
are noted, but confidence in vendor compliance remains uncertain. Leveraging
ontology and text extraction techniques [14], vendors automate privacy policy
compliance efforts, streamlining data protection measures. These advancements
signifyprogressinmanagingprivacyconstraints,butcomprehensivecompliance
assurance remains a challenge.
Inourearlierresearchstudies,wedevelopedafoundationalcomplianceknowl-
edge graph to include various regulations and incorporated a selection of ven-
dor privacy policy descriptions into the ontology without directly linking them
to specific GDPR chapters or sections. Also, we correlated these documents
with Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) controls to bridge gaps. In our past re-
search[10,11],weidentifiedrelevantsectionsbyextractingkeywordsandentities
fromtheglossariesorappendicesofregulations.Wethenidentifiedthesemanti-
callysimilarkeywordsassociatedwithGDPRregulationfromthevendorprivacy
policies. Further, we checked for the semantic similarity between the summaries
of the entire GDPR and the privacy policy document using a generic BERT
abstractive summarize [9]. In another research work, we have incorporated the
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 8228 [4] risk mitigation
areas into the knowledge graph. [5,8].
Expandinguponthisgroundwork,ourcurrentresearchseekstoaligntheex-
tracted GDPR articles from vendor privacy policies, pinpointing any previously
overlooked articles. This effort is designed to assist vendors in refining their
policy documents. Given the extensive nature of these regulations, our focus is
primarilyonGDPRcompliance,recognizingitssignificanceforvendorshandling
data from EU users. The traditional approach often necessitates manual review
to ensure compliance. However, our methodology proposes a more efficient solu-
tion for identifying and addressing gaps in vendor privacy policies, reducing the
need for human intervention.
2.2 Information Extraction using LLMs
Although mostly statistical and rule-based methods have been used for in-
formation extraction [22,23], recent advancements in LLMs have opened up
new methodologies.LLMs have been extensively used for information extraction
across various domains. For information extraction tasks, LLMs have been uti-
lizedforgeneratingstructuredentitiesandrelationshipscircumventingtheneed
to use supervised models [15,20,34]. However, to find more success in specific
domains, LLMs have been fine-tuned to perform the task of information extrac-
tion.Forexample,inthecaseofscientificdataextraction[7]andagriculturedata6 L. Garza et al.
Fig.1:OverallFrameworkforBuildingandQueryingGDPRVendorPolicyMan-
agement Knowledge Graph
extraction [21], fine-tuned LLMs have been used. LLMs have also been used for
improving annotations in the medical domain, by periodically fine-tuning based
on human feedback [13]. In the domain of cybersecurity, LLMs have also been
used for information combination and extraction [18,19]. However, training and
fine-tuning an LLM is computationally expensive and there is little guarantee
that the model will not suffer from hallucinations. In our approach, we have
utilized the power of RAG to limit the possibilities of hallucinations and avoid
the cost of fine-tuning for our specific application scenario.
3 Methodology
The Privacy Policy Compliance Verification Knowledge Graph (PrivComp-KG)
formalizes GDPR rules and guidelines using Semantic Web technologies. It fa-
cilitates automated compliance checking, enhances transparency, and supports
granular consent management. The Knowledge Graph allows for swift cross-PrivComp-KG: Leveraging KG and LLM for Compliance Verification 7
referencing of regulatory requirements and vendor privacy policies, enabling ef-
ficient management of vendor data and adherence to regulations. Compliance
inference using SWRL (Semantic Web Rule Language) rules [27] enriches the
understanding of privacy policies, facilitating dynamic compliance and reason-
ing over gaps in policies. The PrivComp-KG is populated with relevant privacy
policy properties by leveraging LLMs to assess privacy policies’ alignment with
regulatoryarticles,suchasGDPR.WeemployRetrieval-AugmentedGeneration

The overall framework for PrivComp-KG creation and population using LLMs
and end user querying is demonstrated in Figure 1.

LLMs are increasingly valued for their deep understanding of natural language.

the alignment of a privacy policy with GDPR articles. Previous efforts have
focusedonfine-tuningLLMstoidentifysimilarGDPRentitiescorrespondingto
aspecificprivacypolicy[9].However,bothLLMsingeneralandfine-tunedLLMs
specifically are prone to hallucinations when confronted with queries relating
to unfamiliar domains. An increasingly popular method to address this issue
is RAG. We opt for RAG due to the dynamic nature of the domain. Given
that data privacy laws can be evolving, characterized by the emergence of new
regulations, RAG aids in response generation without the need for continual
model fine-tuning for every update in privacy laws and regulations.
The core components of an LLM consist of (i) a query or prompt, denoted
as P, and (ii) a response, represented by R. In the context of RAG-enabled
LLMs,thegenerationofRreliesonasetofdocuments,denotedasD.Weutilize
RAGnotonlytoproduceresponsesforpromptsinquiringabouttherelationship
between a privacy policy and a GDPR article but also to identify the specific
segments of a GDPR article that align with a privacy policy.
WesegmenteachGDPRarticleintochunksandintegratethemintoavector
store.EachsegmentoftheGDPRarticleisassignedarepresentationwithinthe
vector store. Our vector store contains 430 chunks of GDPR articles, with each
article further divided into multiple segments. Typically, each paragraph of a
GDPR article corresponds to one vector within our vector store. An example of
our prompt P is illustrated in Figure 2.
As part of the metadata for the chunks inserted into the vector store, we
includethespecificGDPRarticlefromwhicheachchunkwasextracted.Atypical
P forthissystemmightbe"WhichGDPRarticledoesthisprivacypolicyrelate

7B) to generate R. In the example, we highlight Article 21, which achieved the

for the similarity score and list all articles used in generating R.
This process creates a comprehensive list of articles that correlate with a
given privacy policy. Our system supports dynamic updates to privacy policies,
as model retraining is unnecessary when policies are amended or added. The
knowledge derived from privacy policies and their corresponding articles can be
incorporated into our PrivComp-KG. In the following sections, we elaborate on
how the reasoning capabilities of a knowledge graph can be leveraged to derive
valuable insights from privacy policies and the associated GDPR articles.
3.2 PrivComp-KG: Privacy Policy Compliance Verification
Knowledge Graph
Leveraging Semantic Web technologies can streamline regulatory compliance.
Using the Semantic Web for privacy policy compliance offers advantages such
as standardization and machine readability. It enables automated compliance
checkingbyrepresentingpoliciesinaformatthatsoftwaretoolscanunderstand
andanalyze.Thisapproachenhancestransparencybyallowingpolicywritersto
easilycomprehenddataprivacyrequirementsandgapsintheirexistingpolicies.
Furthermore, the semantic representations facilitate granular consent manage-
ment, tailoring policies to specific regulations.
We utilized the semantic web languages Resource Description Framework
(RDF) [31] and Web Ontology Language (OWL) [30] to capture and formalizePrivComp-KG: Leveraging KG and LLM for Compliance Verification 9
Fig.3:PrivComp-KG:PrivacyPolicyComplianceVerificationKnowledgeGraph
along with Instances of the classes
the rules and guidelines outlined in GDPR and Vendor policy documents. We
developed the novel Privacy Compliance Verification KG, PrivComp-KG. It is
designed to be in the public domain and can be adopted quickly and easily
by vendors who are seeking to adhere to these regulations. The ontology is
alsoplatform-independentandcanbeintegratedwiththelatestdataprotection
regulations and many other data regulation entities.
RDF enhances the structuring of knowledge on the web, simplifying the re-
trieval of domain-specific information for vendors. PrivComp-KG is integrated
with our existing Reference Document Knowledge Graph [9], allowing for the
swift and effective cross-referencing of regulatory requirements and vendor pri-
vacypolicies.AsillustratedinFigure3,thishigh-levelknowledgegraphmanages
GDPRrulesandvendorpolicyextractedresults.Thisknowledgegraphisspecif-
ically designed to accommodate any applicable regulations for various vendors
or companies based on the types of data they collect. Our focus on GDPR,
a pivotal regulation with extensive stipulations, forms a critical component of
thisresearchmethodology.UtilizingProtegesoftware[24,32],afree,open-source
platform for ontology editing and reasoning, we constructed and managed our
ontology. This structured and standardized approach not only facilitates the
management of vendor data but also ensures adherence to regulations, thereby
safeguarding customer data and privacy. Our knowledge graph is hosted in a
public space, providing accessible user interaction.
In our earlier research, described in [9], we could only retrieve high-level
entities and didn’t examine the specific rules or articles related to privacy poli-10 L. Garza et al.
cies.Additionally,ourpreviousversionoftheknowledgegraphcategorizedmost
GDPR rules as classes, which made it challenging to compare results across
different sections of the GDPR. Structuring these as instances improved our
ability to identify what was missing quickly or had been extracted. We used the
insightsfromtheSection3.1toupdatethedatapropertiesoftheProvider class.
With this research, we’ve successfully refined our knowledge graph to manage
and search GDPR rules flexibly and compare them with those extracted from
vendorpolicydocuments.WedesignedthisknowledgegraphtoincludeaRegula-
tions class that branches into various regulations like PCI-DSS, HIPAA, CCPA,
etc. This study extracted relevant chapters, articles, and obligations from the
GDPR and stored them as instances in GDPR_Chapter, GDPR_Articles, and
GDPR_Obligations.
3.3 Regulatory Obligations:
BeyondthecurationofProviderPrivacyPoliciesandPolicyRegulations,thekey
insight in PrivComp-KG is drawn from the Regulatory Obligations instances.
Every regulation describes based on the role of the data actor, the specific set
of rules that apply to the data actor. For example, a provider, i.e. an orga-
nization offering a specific service, may collect data to support that service.
However, GDPR clearly states in its provider guidelines, the specific measures
that the providers need to take to protect data privacy. Additionally, some gen-
eralruleswithregardstotheethicsandresponsibilityofdatacollectionapplyto
the providers. This knowledge about the specific role and application of GDPR
sections is encoded in the GDPR_Obligations class. Specifically, there are 5
instances of the GDPR_Obligations, each describing a specific role:
– Consumer_Obligations Consumers must inform the supervisory authority
and the data subject about any personal data breaches. Additionally, the
consumermustconductaDataProtectionImpactAssessment(DPIA),con-
sult with the supervisory authority before processing if the DPIA indicates
ahighrisk,andappointaDataProtectionOfficerwhenprocessingpersonal
data on a large scale.
– Common_Obligations Rules that apply to both consumers and providers,
who are responsible for ensuring compliance.
– Data_Subject_Obligations Consumers must inform data subjects about the
duration for which, or why, data will be retained upon collection. Conse-
quently,ifdatasubjectsrequesttheremovaloftheirdata,anditisnolonger
necessary for the purposes for which it was collected, it must be erased.
– General_Obligations GDPR mentions generic rules that are not specific to
any role but apply to all the data processing activities in general.
– Provider_Obligations Provider is primarily responsible for assisting con-
sumersintheeventofdatabreachesandprocessingdatainaccordancewith
consumer directives. Additionally, the Provider must maintain comprehen-
sive records of all data processing activities and ensure robust data security
measures are in place to protect consumer information.PrivComp-KG: Leveraging KG and LLM for Compliance Verification 11
3.4 Compliance and Regulatory Properties:
ThePrivComp-KGsupportsobjectpropertiesthatlinksclassestosupportcom-
pliance reasoning and verification.
– hasRegulation: Regulations identified in vendor privacy policies are stored
as instances within the Regulation class and linked to the Providers class.
– compliesWithSection: Using the knowledge extraction tool, as described in
Section 3.1, the regulatory articles that individual provider privacy policies

KG using the "compliesWithSection" relation between Providers and

– requriesComplianceWith: Every vendor handling EU user data must adhere
torelevantGDPRrequirements.Toenforcethis,welinktheProviders class
to the GDPR_Chapters through this object property.
– partOfChapter:Sinceachaptercanencompassmultiplearticles,weconnect
the GDPR_Articles to the GDPR_Chapters class to reflect this relation-
ship.
Additionally,toorganizethefindingsfromprivacypolicyanalyses,weestab-
lished several data properties:
– hasChapterIndex: This property stores the indices of chapters identified in
a policy document.
– hasSectionIndex, hasSectionText, and hasSectionURL: These properties are
essential for recording the sections extracted from the documents, including
descriptions and URLs for easy reference.
3.5 Compliance Inference
SWRL rules enhance reasoning capabilities in Semantic Web applications by
allowing the specification of logical rules that define relationships and infer new
information from existing data. The PrivComp-KG supports SWRL rules that
infersnecessaryrulesfromregulatoryarticlesbasedontheroleofthedataactor
and the role based obligations, as described in Section 3.3.
For example, for the privacy policy of a provider that wishes to collect and
utilisedata,thefollowingSWRLrulescaninfertheobligatoryrulesfromGDPR.
S1: Cloud_Providers(?cloud_provider) ^ GDPR_Articles(?gdpr_article)
^ definesObligationsFor(?gdpr_article, Provider_Obligations)
-> requiresComplianceWith(?cloud_provider, ?gdpr_article)
S2: Cloud_Providers(?cloud_provider) ^ GDPR_Articles(?gdpr_article)
^ definesObligationsFor(?gdpr_article, Common_Obligations)
-> requiresComplianceWith(?cloud_provider, ?gdpr_article)12 L. Garza et al.
By applying these SWRL rules, PrivComp-KG can derive detect inconsis-
tencies in existing policies, and make logical deductions about compliance. This
reasoning process enriches the understanding and interpretation of privacy pol-
icy data, facilitating a dynamic approach towards privacy policy compliance,
more advanced semantic querying and data integration. After processing with
the reasoner, users can efficiently compare the required rules against those ex-
tracted, updating any lacking areas in the privacy policy to ensure it is current
and compliant.
4 Experimental Results

The OPP-115 dataset [33] is a comprehensive collection of privacy policies from
variousonlineplatforms,consistingofover115privacypolicies.Itencompassesa

Our LLM based method is used to identify relevant regulatory articles for each
provider in the dataset and then populated into PrivComp-KG. The inferential
engine in PrivComp-KG reasons over the gaps in these provider policies. The
results are made available to end users using a query engine. The results from
our evaluation methods and query engine are described in subsequent sections.
4.2 Evaluation of LLM-guided extraction

the correctness scores for all questions. Questions with low scores (<0.5) re-
quired more specific information regarding the privacy policies. Since our LLM
only accesses GDPR articles, it performs well in questions regarding the simi-
larity of a privacy policy to a GDPR article but struggles with overly specific
questions about the policy itself.
The second metric utilizes the OPP-15 dataset. Since the OPP-15 dataset

leverage it to assess the accuracy of the articles retrieved during R generation.

4.3 Knowledge Graph Inferences and Queries
The PrivComp-KG is populated with the provider privacy policies from the
OPP-115dataset.Furthermore,theidentifiedregulatorysectionsofrelevanceto
the privacy policies are populated with "compliesWithSection" object property.
Finally, using the reasoner, PrivComp-KG automatically updates the GDPR
articles that are mandatory for the given provider using the "requiresCompli-

soner, PrivComp-KG also populates the GDPR articles that require compliance
for "Lids.com", as demonstrated in Fig 5 (b). These information are critical to
policy writers of providers, like "Lids.com", in identifying gaps in their existing
policies. To query the missing articles for a provider that need to be addressed,
we provide the following SPARQL query:
SELECT * WHERE cc:lids.com
cc:requiresComplianceWith ?x MINUS
cc:lids.com cc:compliesWithSection ?x
For "Lids.com", the PrivComp-KG return 40 articles that has been identi-
fied as mandatory according to GDPR, but missing from the existing privacy
policy. This information helps easily identify the gaps in the privacy policy and
effectively identify the guidelines that need to be addressed.
5 Conclusion and Future Work
Inthedigitalage,safeguardingdataprotectionandprivacyhasbecomeparamount.
To effectively manage their operations, many companies enlist the support of
third-party vendors and service providers. These partners play critical roles in
variousaspectsofbusinessfunctions,suchasdatahandling,storage,andprocess-
ing. Entrusting sensitive data to third parties necessitates a rigorous approach
to ensure comprehensive data protection and privacy. Companies must estab-
lish robust protocols and contractual agreements to safeguard the integrity and
confidentialityoftheinformationsharedwiththeseexternalentities.Mostexist-
ing research works focus only on specific sections of the regulation, which won’t
