        "summary": "Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, we propose\nKolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as promising alternatives to Multi-Layer\nPerceptrons (MLPs). While MLPs have fixed activation functions on nodes\n(\"neurons\"), KANs have learnable activation functions on edges (\"weights\").\nKANs have no linear weights at all -- every weight parameter is replaced by a\nunivariate function parametrized as a spline. We show that this seemingly\nsimple change makes KANs outperform MLPs in terms of accuracy and\ninterpretability. For accuracy, much smaller KANs can achieve comparable or\nbetter accuracy than much larger MLPs in data fitting and PDE solving.\nTheoretically and empirically, KANs possess faster neural scaling laws than\nMLPs. For interpretability, KANs can be intuitively visualized and can easily\ninteract with human users. Through two examples in mathematics and physics,\nKANs are shown to be useful collaborators helping scientists (re)discover\nmathematical and physical laws. In summary, KANs are promising alternatives for\nMLPs, opening opportunities for further improving today's deep learning models\nwhich rely heavily on MLPs.",

        "summary": "Vision-language datasets are vital for both text-to-image (T2I) and\nimage-to-text (I2T) research. However, current datasets lack descriptions with\nfine-grained detail that would allow for richer associations to be learned by\nmodels. To fill the gap, we introduce Descriptions of Connected and Contrasting\nImages (DOCCI), a dataset with long, human-annotated English descriptions for\n15k images that were taken, curated and donated by a single researcher intent\non capturing key challenges such as spatial relations, counting, text\nrendering, world knowledge, and more. We instruct human annotators to create\ncomprehensive descriptions for each image; these average 136 words in length\nand are crafted to clearly distinguish each image from those that are related\nor similar. Each description is highly compositional and typically encompasses\nmultiple challenges. Through both quantitative and qualitative analyses, we\ndemonstrate that DOCCI serves as an effective training resource for\nimage-to-text generation -- a PaLI 5B model finetuned on DOCCI shows equal or\nsuperior results compared to highly-performant larger models like LLaVA-1.5 7B\nand InstructBLIP 7B. Furthermore, we show that DOCCI is a useful testbed for\ntext-to-image generation, highlighting the limitations of current text-to-image\nmodels in capturing long descriptions and fine details.",

        "summary": "Every year, plant parasitic nematodes, one of the major groups of plant\npathogens, cause a significant loss of crops worldwide. To mitigate crop yield\nlosses caused by nematodes, an efficient nematode monitoring method is\nessential for plant and crop disease management. In other respects, efficient\nnematode detection contributes to medical research and drug discovery, as\nnematodes are model organisms. With the rapid development of computer\ntechnology, computer vision techniques provide a feasible solution for\nquantifying nematodes or nematode infections. In this paper, we survey and\ncategorise the studies and available datasets on nematode detection through\ndeep-learning models. To stimulate progress in related research, this survey\npresents the potential state-of-the-art object detection models, training\ntechniques, optimisation techniques, and evaluation metrics for deep learning\nbeginners. Moreover, seven state-of-the-art object detection models are\nvalidated on three public datasets and the AgriNema dataset for plant parasitic\nnematodes to construct a baseline for nematode detection.",

        "summary": "Data protection and privacy is becoming increasingly crucial in the digital\nera. Numerous companies depend on third-party vendors and service providers to\ncarry out critical functions within their operations, encompassing tasks such\nas data handling and storage. However, this reliance introduces potential\nvulnerabilities, as these vendors' security measures and practices may not\nalways align with the standards expected by regulatory bodies. Businesses are\nrequired, often under the penalty of law, to ensure compliance with the\nevolving regulatory rules. Interpreting and implementing these regulations pose\nchallenges due to their complexity. Regulatory documents are extensive,\ndemanding significant effort for interpretation, while vendor-drafted privacy\npolicies often lack the detail required for full legal compliance, leading to\nambiguity. To ensure a concise interpretation of the regulatory requirements\nand compliance of organizational privacy policy with said regulations, we\npropose a Large Language Model (LLM) and Semantic Web based approach for\nprivacy compliance. In this paper, we develop the novel Privacy Policy\nCompliance Verification Knowledge Graph, PrivComp-KG. It is designed to\nefficiently store and retrieve comprehensive information concerning privacy\npolicies, regulatory frameworks, and domain-specific knowledge pertaining to\nthe legal landscape of privacy. Using Retrieval Augmented Generation, we\nidentify the relevant sections in a privacy policy with corresponding\nregulatory rules. This information about individual privacy policies is\npopulated into the PrivComp-KG. Combining this with the domain context and\nrules, the PrivComp-KG can be queried to check for compliance with privacy\npolicies by each vendor against relevant policy regulations. We demonstrate the\nrelevance of the PrivComp-KG, by verifying compliance of privacy policy\ndocuments for various organizations.",

        "summary": "Iterative preference optimization methods have recently been shown to perform\nwell for general instruction tuning tasks, but typically make little\nimprovement on reasoning tasks (Yuan et al., 2024, Chen et al., 2024). In this\nwork we develop an iterative approach that optimizes the preference between\ncompeting generated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) candidates by optimizing for winning\nvs. losing reasoning steps that lead to the correct answer. We train using a\nmodified DPO loss (Rafailov et al., 2023) with an additional negative\nlog-likelihood term, which we find to be crucial. We show reasoning improves\nacross repeated iterations of this scheme. While only relying on examples in\nthe training set, our approach results in increasing accuracy for\nLlama-2-70B-Chat from 55.6% to 81.6% on GSM8K (and 88.7% with majority voting\nout of 32 samples), from 12.5% to 20.8% on MATH, and from 77.8% to 86.7% on\nARC-Challenge, which outperforms other Llama-2-based models not relying on\nadditionally sourced datasets.",
