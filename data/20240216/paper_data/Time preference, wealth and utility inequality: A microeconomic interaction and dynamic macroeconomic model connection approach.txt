Abstract
Based on interactions between individuals and others and references to social norms,
this study reveals the impact of heterogeneity in time preference on wealth distribution
and inequality. We present a novel approach that connects the interactions between
microeconomic agents that generate heterogeneity to the dynamic equations for capital
and consumption in macroeconomic models. Using this approach, we estimate the
impact of changes in the discount rate due to microeconomic interactions on capital,
consumption and utility and the degree of inequality. The results show that
intercomparisons with others regarding consumption significantly affect capital, i.e.
wealth inequality. Furthermore, the impact on utility is never small and social norms can
reduce this impact. Our supporting evidence shows that the quantitative results of
inequality calculations correspond to survey data from cohort and cross-cultural studies.
This study’s micro–macro connection approach can be deployed to connect
microeconomic interactions, such as exchange, interest and debt, redistribution, mutual
aid and time preference, to dynamic macroeconomic models.

Wealth inequality has become a significant social problem worldwide. According to the
World Inequality Report 2022 (Chancel et al., 2022), the top 1% of the wealthiest
people account for 38% of the world’s wealth, while the World Economic Forum (2017)
found that only eight men have the same wealth as the poorest 3.6 billion people. The
global Gini index has reached 0.7 (Chancel et al., 2022), well above the warning level
of 0.4 for social unrest (United Nations Human Settlements Programme). Solving
inequality is important because social unrest generates a vicious cycle that reduces
productivity, increases inequality and fuels social unrest (Sedik & Xu, 2020).
According to the macroeconomics review literature on heterogeneity (Heathcote et al.,
2009), efforts to focus on microeconomic heterogeneity in macroeconomics have three
main directions: individual endogenous heterogeneity and exogenous shocks, individual
insurance against exogenous risks and the interaction between idiosyncratic risks and
aggregate dynamics. Concerning sources of heterogeneity, efforts have been made
regarding endogenous capabilities and preferences as initial conditions for individuals
and transitory and persistent shocks as exogenous conditions.
The importance of heterogeneity in individuals’ time preferences for wealth inequality
is well known (Frederick et al., 2002). Individual wealth accumulation and consumption
are strongly influenced by how future values are discounted and heterogeneity in time
preferences leads to wealth inequality. Considerable research has investigated the
relationship between time preference and inequality. The representative literature
includes a model in which heterogeneity in discount rates leads to wealth concentration
(Becker, 1980), an empirical study of the relationship between heterogeneity in time
preference and inequality (Lawrance, 1991) and a model to explain inequality from the
distribution of discount rates (Krusell & Smith, 1998). Additional studies include a
model to estimate heterogeneity in time preferences from the distribution of inequality
(Hendricks, 2007), a model to account for inequality by adding consumer choice and
human capital formation to heterogeneity in time preferences (Suen, 2014) and an
empirical study of the relationship between differences in saving behaviour and
inequality based on the distribution of time preferences (Epper et al., 2020).Two main approaches exist to studying utility functions, including time preference: the
constant and endogenous discount rates (Shi & Epstein, 1993). The constant rate is a
model that expresses instantaneous utility as consumption versus reference stock under
a constant discount rate (Ryder & Heal, 1973; Carroll et al., 1997; Strulik, 2008). In
contrast, the endogenous discount rate adds the effect of endogenous habit formation to
the discount rate for instantaneous utility (Uzawa, 1968; Epstein, 1987; Obstfeld, 1990;
Chang et al., 2011; Zhang, 2012). In dealing with heterogeneity in time preference, the
model that deals with endogenous changes in discount rates is more suitable than the
model that deals with constant discount rates.
Reviewing the literature on the measurement of time preference (Frederick et al., 2002;
Cohen et al., 2020) indicates three main measurement models: the exponential,
hyperbolic and quasi-hyperbolic forms. The classical exponential form is a function
with the discount rate as the base and time as the exponent (Samuelson, 1937). The
hyperbolic form is a function with the linear function of the term multiplied by the
discount rate and time as the base and the inverse of the discount rate as the exponent
(Prelec & Loewenstein, 1991). The quasi-hyperbolic form is a function of the
exponential form multiplied by the present bias factor (Laibson, 1997). Wang et al.
(2016) measured time preference in 53 countries based on quasi-hyperbolic forms,
which Rieger et al. (2021) combined with the sociological and social psychology survey
literature to obtain universal time preference in 117 countries.
Previous studies on time preference have identified the introduction of various
heterogeneities (Sedik & Xu, 2020), reflecting the interaction of multiple psychological
motivations (Frederick et al., 2002) and considering psychological factors such as trust,
confusion and context (Cohen et al., 2020), as future challenges. Concerning these
issues, social psychology has traditionally studied the close relationship between self
and others (Markus & Wurf, 1987), while cognitive science has investigated the social
brain hypothesis that social groups influence the human brain (Dunbar, 2003). The
comparative institutional analysis of microeconomics posits that shared expectations
constrain individual strategies and behaviours as a summary expression of the group’s
equilibrium state (Aoki, 2001). Additionally, the theory of social norms related to public
economics states that social norms, including customs, manners and rules, broadlyoriginate from mutual expectations and approval with others based on sympathetic
human tendencies (Heath, 2008). Therefore, it is essential to consider interactions with
others and social groups as psychological motivations and factors related to time
preferences; however, while conventional economic studies on time preference have
examined the effects on individuals’ endogenous habit formation and preference
changes for exogenous shocks, no studies focus on others’ interactions and social
context.
The agent-based model (ABM) is an approach that introduces microeconomic
interactions into the macroeconomy. The related literature (Haldane & Turrell, 2018)
states that macroeconomic ABM attempts to understand macro-level behaviour by
having rule-based interactions among agents (Turrell, 2016). Representative studies
show phase transitions between low and high-unemployment economies by setting firm
production and price rules (Gualdi et al., 2015). Additional studies have shown that
policy indicators such as gross domestic product, growth and unemployment rates by
modelling the behaviour of government, bank, firm and household agents (Caiani et al.,
2016) and that business cycles are due to the interaction of agents’ decision-making
with cognitive restrictions (De Grauwe, 2010). Note that agents’ behaviour in
macroeconomic ABM is rule-based and autonomous dynamic behaviour is discarded.
Econophysics is an approach that uses ABM and focuses specifically on wealth
distribution and inequality. The literature in this realm (Chatterjee & Chakrabarti, 2007;
Chakrabarti AS & BK, 2010) shows that asset exchanges among many agents are
modelled based on physical analogies to simulate various wealth distributions.
Representative studies have shown that the gamma distribution is caused by the
stochastic process of the exchange of assets other than savings (Angle, 1986) and that
the delta distribution uses the analogy of the kinetic energy exchange of gas particles
(Chakraborti, 2002). Further research has shown that changes in tax rates and insurance
can cause exponential and gamma distributions to interchange (Guala, 2009;
Chakrabarti AS & BK, 2010). No macroeconomic models are incorporated into these
econophysical agents.
This study aims to simulate the distribution and inequality of wealth and utility by
setting up a new dynamic model concerning both econophysics and macroeconomicABM. We also investigate the heterogeneity of time preference, i.e. discount rate, based
on the interaction between individuals and others and the social context and norms.
Econophysics has a physical analogy-based agent that differs from reality and the
macroeconomic ABM has a behavioural rule-based agent. In contrast, this study takes
the approach of connecting microeconomic interactions with dynamic macroeconomic
agents to incorporate the dynamic behaviour of autonomous agents. Unlike previous
studies that calculate wealth inequality from the distribution of pre-given time
preferences (Suen, 2014), examine the relationship between measured time preference
distributions and inequality (Epper et al., 2020) or change time preferences through
endogenous habit formation (Zhang, 2012), this study takes a unique approach. We
examine the distribution and inequality of wealth and utility generated by the
distribution of time preferences generated from initial uniform time preferences through
interactions with others and social norms. Our approach is limited in that it assumes an
impact on time preference by its interactions and social norms, but as with Zhang’s
habit formation, the actual survey researches suport the findings obtained.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The Methods section first refers to
the Ramsey–Cass–Koopmans model (Ramsey, 1928; Cass, 1965; Koopmans, 1965),
one of the basic models of dynamic macroeconomics. On this basis, we show how to
calculate the dynamic saddle path and the utility for discount rate changes concerning
capital and individual agents’ consumption. Following an econophysical approach, we
then formulate changes in the discount rates based on intercomparisons of capital or
consumption among agents and references to social norms. Through repeated
interactions and references, the Results section simulates changes in the distribution of
discount rates from initial uniform values and corresponding changes in the distribution
of wealth and utility. This section also presents the calculation results of coefficients of
variation and Gini indices that represent inequality among agents. The Discussion
section considers the impact of intercomparisons and social norms on inequality, along
with the interpretation of the results and mentions the potential of developing an
approach that connects microeconomic interactions other than time preference, such as
exchange, debt, redistribution and mutual aid, to dynamic macroeconomics. Finally, the
Conclusion section presents the main inferences and addresses future issues.METHODS
Dynamic macroeconomic model
This study refers to the dynamic equations for capital and consumption in the Ramsey–
Cass–Koopmans model as the basic dynamic macroeconomic model (Romer, 2019: 59–
60, 95; Nakata, 2011: 45). Suppose capital per individual (household) is 𝑘 ,
consumption is 𝑐, the production function is 𝑓(𝑘), the capital depletion rate is 𝛿, the
labour growth rate is 𝜆, the knowledge growth rate is 𝜅, the discount rate of time
preference is 𝜌 and the relative risk aversion coefficient is 𝜃. In this case, the dynamic
equations for capital 𝑘 and consumption 𝑐 concerning time 𝑡 are expressed as
equations (1) and (2).
𝑘̇(𝑡) = 𝑓(𝑘(𝑡))−𝑐(𝑡) −(𝛿 + 𝜆 + 𝜅)𝑘(𝑡). (1)
𝑐̇(𝑡) 𝑓′(𝑘(𝑡))− 𝛿 −𝜌−𝜃𝜅
= . (2)
𝑐(𝑡) 𝜃
This study uses the Cobb–Douglas function 𝑓(𝑘(𝑡)) = 𝑘(𝑡)𝛼 as the production
function (Romer, 2019: 13; Nakata, 2011: 121) and setting 𝜆 = 𝜅 = 0 because the
labour and knowledge growth rates are not covered. Then, the dynamic equations can be
rewritten as equations (3) and (4).
𝑘̇(𝑡) = 𝑘(𝑡)𝛼 −𝑐(𝑡) −𝛿𝑘(𝑡). (3)
𝛼𝑘(𝑡)𝛼−1− 𝛿 −𝜌
𝑐̇(𝑡) = 𝑐(𝑡) . (4)
𝜃
These dynamic equations are known to converge at the saddle point (Romer, 2019: 62–
65; Nakata, 2011: 122). If we solve the equations with the left-hand side of (3) and (4)
set to zero, the capital 𝑘∗ and consumption 𝑐∗ at the saddle point can be expressed as
equations (5) and (6).

𝑘∗ = ( ) .

𝑐∗ = 𝑘∗𝛼 −𝛿𝑘∗. (6)
We now assume the case where the discount rate changes (Romer, 2019: 67–69). Let𝜌 be the discount rate before the change and 𝜌 be the discount rate after the
𝑂𝐿𝐷 𝑁𝐸𝑊
change. Then, using equations (5) and (6), the saddle points 𝑘∗ and 𝑐∗ before the
𝑂𝐿𝐷 𝑂𝐿𝐷
change are expressed as equations (7) and (8); the saddle points 𝑘∗ and 𝑐∗ are
𝑁𝐸𝑊 𝑁𝐸𝑊
expressed as equations (9) and (10) after the change.

When the discount rate changes from 𝜌 to 𝜌 , capital 𝑘∗ initially maintains
𝑂𝐿𝐷 𝑁𝐸𝑊 𝑂𝐿𝐷
the same value because it cannot change discontinuously and consumption 𝑐∗ jumps
𝑂𝐿𝐷
discontinuously (Romer, 2019: 67–69). At this time, capital 𝑘 and consumption 𝑐
𝐴 𝐴
are expressed as equations (11)–(14) (Romer, 2019: 69–71).

After the change, capital 𝑘 and consumption 𝑐 converge along an adjustment path
𝐴 𝐴
toward the new saddle points 𝑘∗ and 𝑐∗ (Romer, 2019: 69–71). Along this
𝑁𝐸𝑊 𝑁𝐸𝑊

represented by the approximate equations (15) and (16).

𝑐 (𝑡) = 𝑐∗ + 𝑒𝜇𝑡(𝑐 − 𝑐∗ ). (16)

We next refer to the Ramsey–Cass–Koopmans infinite-horizon model as the basic utility
model (Romer, 2019: 52–55; Nakata, 2011: 40–44). The infinite-horizon utility function
𝑈 is expressed as equation (17). Here, the discount rate is 𝜌, the instantaneous utility is
𝑢(𝑐(𝑡)) and the instantaneous utility, 𝑢(𝑐(𝑡)), is 𝑐(𝑡)1−𝜃⁄(1−𝜃) with constant
relative risk aversion.

𝑈 = ∫ 𝑒−𝜌𝑡𝑢(𝑐(𝑡))𝑑𝑡 = ∫ 𝑒−𝜌𝑡 𝑑𝑡. (17)

𝑡 = 0 𝑡 = 0
For a measure of time preference based on the quasi-hyperbolic form, the utility
function 𝑈 is expressed as equation (18). Here, patience is 𝑢 , the current bias is 𝛽
0 𝑝
and the discount rate is 𝜙 (Wang et al., 2016). Rewriting 𝜙𝑡 as an exponential
function with 𝑒 as the base, −ln(1⁄𝜙)𝑡 as the exponent and setting 𝑢 = 0 and
0
𝛽 = 1 for simplicity, equation (18) coincides with (17).

We now assume that the discount rate changes 𝑛 times in the middle of an infinite
horizon. Let the time of change be 𝑡 ,𝑡 ,⋯ , 𝑡 and the discount rate be 𝜌 ,𝜌 ,⋯,𝜌 .

Then, the utility function, 𝑈, is expressed as equation (19).

The interaction model of time preference
We refer to the econophysics approach in modelling interactions with others and
referencing social norms regarding time preferences. In econophysics (Chatterjee &
Chakrabarti, 2007; Chakrabarti, AS & BK, 2010), two agents are randomly selected
from a large number of agents, the exchange of assets between them is modelled and therepeated selection of two agents is used to simulate various wealth distributions. Thus,
we model the change in time preference due to the interaction between agents 𝑖 and 𝑗.
Let the discount rates of both agents at time 𝑡 be 𝜌 (𝑡) and 𝜌 (𝑡); both change
𝑂𝐿𝐷𝑖 𝑂𝐿𝐷𝑗
to 𝜌 (𝑡) and 𝜌 (𝑡) due to their interaction in equations (20) and (21),
𝑁𝐸𝑊𝑖 𝑁𝐸𝑊𝑗
respectively.

The second and third terms in the brackets on the right-hand side of equations (20) and
(21) represent the interaction based on the intercomparison of capital 𝑘 (𝑡) and 𝑘 (𝑡)
𝑖 𝑗
and consumption 𝑐 (𝑡) and 𝑐 (𝑡) (t), respectively, because the time preference is
𝑖 𝑗
considered to be influenced by both capital (future consumption) and current
consumption (Romer, 2019: 370–371). 𝛽 ≥ 1 and 𝛽 ≥ 1 are parameters that
𝑘 𝑐
represent the so-called ‘the grass is greener on the other side’ psychological bias. The
existence of this psychological bias is well known in neuroscience (Boorman et al.,
2009; Noritake et al., 2018); however, its effects on capital and consumption remain
unexamined; therefore, we formulate them here as in equations (20) and (21). Here,
0 ≤ 𝜀 ≤ 1 and 0≤ 𝜀 ≤ 1 are the parameters for the strength of the interaction.
𝑘 𝑐
Equation (20) explains that if 𝛽 𝑘 (𝑡) > 𝑘 (𝑡) when others’ capital appears larger, the
𝑘 𝑗 𝑖
discount rate 𝜌 (𝑡) becomes smaller than 𝜌 (𝑡) (reducing consumption).
𝑁𝐸𝑊𝑖 𝑂𝐿𝐷𝑖
Furthermore, if 𝛽 𝑐 (𝑡) > 𝑐 (𝑡) when others’ consumption appears larger, 𝜌 (𝑡)
𝑐 𝑗 𝑖 𝑁𝐸𝑊𝑖
becomes larger than 𝜌 (𝑡) (increasing consumption).
𝑂𝐿𝐷𝑖
The fourth term represents the reference to the social normative discount rate, 𝜌 ,
𝑁𝑂𝑅𝑀
where 0≤ 𝜀 ≤ 1 is a parameter indicating the strength of the reference. Social norms
𝜌
include secular morality, Buddhist teachings and Islamic law. If 𝜀 = 𝜀 = 0 and
𝑘 𝑐
𝜀 = 1, then 𝜌 (𝑡) = 𝜌 (𝑡) = 𝜌 . Equation (20) explains that if
𝜌 𝑁𝐸𝑊𝑖 𝑁𝐸𝑊𝑗 𝑁𝑂𝑅𝑀𝜌 (𝑡) > 𝜌 when the current discount rate is larger than the normative
𝑂𝐿𝐷𝑖 𝑁𝑂𝑅𝑀
discount rate, then 𝜌 (𝑡) becomes smaller than 𝜌 (𝑡) (reducing consumption).
𝑁𝐸𝑊𝑖 𝑂𝐿𝐷𝑖
In other words, the normative discount rate 𝜌 works in a suppressive manner;
𝑁𝑂𝑅𝑀
however, if 𝜌 is large (when the whole society is ephemeral), 𝜌 (𝑡) will
𝑁𝑂𝑅𝑀 𝑁𝐸𝑊𝑖
become larger (increasing consumption).
Figure 1 shows the computational flow for time preference interaction. First, in Step I,
the number of agents (𝑁), the time increment (∆𝑡) of the computation, the period (𝑡 )
𝑝
for the interaction and the maximum time (𝑡 ) for the computation are set as initial
𝑚𝑎𝑥
settings. Furthermore, the initial discount rate (𝜌 ), the initial utility (𝑈 ), the exponent
0 0
(𝛼) of the production function, the capital depletion rate (𝛿) and the coefficient of
relative risk aversion (𝜃) are set as initial settings for all agents. Although not shown in
Figure 1, parameters 𝛽 , 𝛽 , 𝜀 , 𝜀 and 𝜀 in equations (20) and (21) are also set
𝑘 𝑐 𝑘 𝑐 𝜌
together. In Step II, we use the initial values and equations (5) and (6) and calculate the
capital (𝑘∗) and consumption (𝑐∗) for all agents at time 𝑡 = 0. In Step III, we advance
0 0
time 𝑡 to 𝑡 + 𝛥𝑡. In Step IV, we calculate the surplus 𝑀𝑜𝑑(𝑡⁄𝑡 ) of time 𝑡 and
𝑝
divided by 𝑡 . If it is 0, we return to Step V; if the value is not 0, we proceed to Step
𝑝
IX.
In Step V, we randomly select two agents 𝑖 and 𝑗 (𝑖 ≠ 𝑗,𝑖,𝑗 = 1,2,⋯,𝑁) among 𝑁
agents. In Step VI, using equations (20) and (21), we change the discount rates
𝜌 (𝑡) and 𝜌 (𝑡) of agents 𝑖 and 𝑗 to 𝜌 (𝑡) and 𝜌 (𝑡), respectively.
𝑂𝐿𝐷𝑖 𝑂𝐿𝐷𝑗 𝑁𝐸𝑊𝑖 𝑁𝐸𝑊𝑗
In Step VII, using equations (11) and (12), we change the capital 𝑘 (𝑡) and
𝑂𝐿𝐷𝑖
consumption 𝑐 (𝑡) for agent 𝑖 and 𝑘 (𝑡) and 𝑐 (𝑡) for 𝑗 to 𝑘 (𝑡),
𝑂𝐿𝐷𝑖 𝑂𝐿𝐷𝑗 𝑂𝐿𝐷𝑗 𝐴𝑖
𝑐 (𝑡), 𝑘 (𝑡) and 𝑐 (𝑡), respectively. In Step VIII, using equations (15) and (16), we
𝐴𝑖 𝐴𝑗 𝐴𝑗
set the adjustment paths 𝑘 (𝑡), 𝑐 (𝑡), 𝑘 (𝑡) and 𝑐 (𝑡) toward the new
𝐴𝐷𝐽𝑖 𝐴𝐷𝐽𝑖 𝐴𝐷𝐽𝑗 𝐴𝐷𝐽𝑗
saddle points 𝑘 (𝑡), 𝑐 (𝑡), 𝑘 (𝑡) and 𝑐 (𝑡), which are calculated
𝑁𝐸𝑊𝑖 𝑁𝐸𝑊𝑖 𝑁𝐸𝑊𝑗 𝑁𝐸𝑊𝑗
using equations (9) and (10). After that, as time 𝑡 advances, 𝑘 (𝑡), 𝑐 (𝑡), 𝑘 (𝑡) and
𝑖 𝑖 𝑗
𝑐 (𝑡) proceed along the adjustment path.
𝑗
In Step IX, which follows from Step IV or VIII, we calculate the increment of utility 𝑈
𝑖
corresponding to time increment ∆𝑡 for each agent 𝑖 (𝑖 = 1,2,⋯,𝑁) based on
equations (17) or (19); we use the discount rate 𝜌 (𝑡) and instantaneous utility
𝑖𝑐 (𝑡)1−𝜃⁄(1− 𝜃) at time 𝑡. In Step X, if time 𝑡 has reached 𝑡 , we proceed to
𝑖 𝑚𝑎𝑥
Step XI; otherwise, we return to Step III. In Step XI, we calculate the utility from time
𝑡 to infinite horizon ∞ using the discount rate 𝜌 (𝑡 ) at time 𝑡 , added to
𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑖 𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑚𝑎𝑥
utility 𝑈 and the process ends. If the discount rate is changed again by returning to
𝑖
Step III and proceeding from IV to VI, the new saddle point is recalculated and 𝑘 (𝑡),
𝑖
𝑐 (𝑡), 𝑘 (𝑡) and 𝑐 (𝑡) proceed along the new adjustment path.

Figure 1: Computational flow for time preference interactionRESULTS
First, we initialize the common parameters to be used in the calculations. The number of
agents is set to 𝑁 = 1,000 (sufficient to compute the wealth distribution and Gini
index). The time increment is ∆𝑡 = 1⁄(24 × 365) (hour), the interaction period is
𝑡 = 1⁄365 (day) and the maximum computation time is 𝑡 = 10 (years). These
𝑝 𝑚𝑎𝑥
values are relative; therefore, they could be read as 10 hours, 10 days and 100 years,
respectively. Over 10 years, 7,300 people (10 × 365 × 2) would change their
behaviour, each receiving an average of 0.73 interactions per year.
The initial discount rate is set to 𝜌 = ln(1⁄𝜙) = 0.223 using the value 𝜙~0.8
0
from the literature (Wang et al., 2016) and equation (18). The normative discount rate is
set to 𝜌 = 0.2, which is smaller than the initial value and the initial utility is set
𝑁𝑂𝑅𝑀
to 𝑈 = 0. We set the exponent 𝛼 and capital depletion rate 𝛿 of the production
0
function to 𝛼 = 0.5 and 𝛿 = 0.1 respectively, based on the values used in the
literature (Romer, 2019: 27, 72; Nakata, 2011: 9, 90, 94; Hasumi, 2020: 25–26, 71). For
the coefficient of relative risk aversion (𝜃), a wide variety of values have been reported
depending on the measurement method and subject (Hartog et al., 2002; Itou, 2008;
Elminejada et al., 2022); however, here it is set to 𝜃 = 0.5. Initial capital and
consumption are calculated as 𝑘 = 2.39 and 𝑐 = 1.31 using equations (5) and (6),
0 0
respectively.
We used the following 12 calculations for the discount rate, the others’ interaction
parameters (𝜀 , 𝜀 ) and the social norm reference parameter (𝜀 ): (i) three cases of
𝑘 𝑐 𝜌
𝜀 = 0.1, 0.2 or 0.3 (𝜀 = 𝜀 = 0); (ii) three cases of 𝜀 = 0.1, 0.2 or 0.3
𝑘 𝑐 𝜌 𝑐
(𝜀 = 𝜀 = 0); (iii) three cases where the setting in (i) changes to 𝜀 = 0.1; and (iv)
𝑘 𝜌 𝜌
three cases where the setting in (ii) is changed to 𝜀 = 0.1. Primarily, the strength of
𝜌
the interaction is expressed in terms of 𝜀 and 𝜀 and the constant 𝛽 = 𝛽 = 1.1
𝑘 𝑐 𝑘 𝑐
are set for the psychological bias parameter.
Figure 2 shows the calculated distributions of discount rate, capital, consumption and
utility for capital interactions 𝜀 = 0.1, 𝜀 = 𝜀 = 0 and 𝛽 = 1.1. Figure 2A

Figure 2B shows that comparing capital with others, the mean of discount rate 𝜌(𝑡 )

Figures 2D and 2F show that the mean of capital 𝑘(𝑡 ) and consumption 𝑐(𝑡 )

increase from initial 𝑘 = 2.39 and 𝑐 = 1.31 to 2.65 and 1.36, respectively. The

for 𝑈. Except for 𝑈, the others are generally normal distributions.
Figure 3 shows the temporal changes in discount rate, capital, consumption and utility
for 𝜀 = 0.1 and 𝜀 = 𝜀 = 0, as in Figure 2. Figure 3A plots the discount rate 𝜌

Figures 3C and 3D show the capital 𝑘 and 3E and 3F show the consumption 𝑐.
Figures 3G and 3H are the values of the interval integral of utility 𝑈 from time 0 to 𝑡.
Note that the value of utility 𝑈 converges to a constant value at infinite horizon ∞.
Figure 3A shows that agent #1 received nine interactions. In Figure 3B, the discount
rate 𝜌 decreases around time 𝑡 = 7.0 and accordingly, Figure 3F shows that the
consumption 𝑐 decreases discontinuously. Thereafter, Figures 3D and 3F indicate that
capital 𝑘 and consumption 𝑐 follow an adjustment path and converge to a new saddle
point. At the new saddle point, capital 𝑘 and consumption 𝑐 are higher than before the
decrease in discount rate 𝜌 (Romer, 2019: 67–69). In other words, comparing capital
with others suppresses the agent’s consumption once; however, it leads to a higher level
of economic behaviour in the future. Figure 3H shows a slight inflexion in the curve of
utility 𝑈 due to the change in the discount rate 𝜌.
Figure 4 shows the calculated distributions of discount rate, capital, consumption and
utility for consumption interactions 𝜀 = 0.1, 𝜀 = 𝜀 = 0 and 𝛽 = 1.1. Figure
𝑐 𝑘 𝜌 𝑐
4A plots the discount rate 𝜌(𝑡 ) for agent number # and Figure 4B shows the
𝑚𝑎𝑥
frequency distribution of discount rate 𝜌(𝑡 ). Similarly, Figures 4C and 4D show the
𝑚𝑎𝑥
capital 𝑘(𝑡 ), 4E and 4F show the consumption 𝑐(𝑡 ) and 4G and 4H show the
𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑚𝑎𝑥
utility 𝑈. By comparison of consumption with others, in Figure 4B, the mean of
discount rate 𝜌(𝑡 ) increases from the initial 𝜌 = 0.223 to 0.240 (future
𝑚𝑎𝑥 0despised). Accordingly, Figures 4D and 4F show that the mean of capital 𝑘(𝑡 ) and
𝑚𝑎𝑥
consumption 𝑐(𝑡 ) decrease from initial 𝑘 = 2.39 and 𝑐 = 1.31 to 2.17 and
𝑚𝑎𝑥 0 0
1.25, respectively. This finding is opposite to the trend in Figure 2. The skewness and
kurtosis of the distribution of 𝜌(𝑡 ) are 1.00 and 4.59, respectively, −0.73 and
𝑚𝑎𝑥
3.72 for 𝑘(𝑡 ), −0.85 and 4.08 for 𝑐(𝑡 ) and −1.42 and 5.99 for 𝑈.
𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑚𝑎𝑥
These values are all larger than that in Figure 2, indicating that consumption interaction
𝜀 distorts the shape of the distribution more than capital interaction 𝜀 .
𝑐 𝑘
Figure 5 shows the temporal changes in discount rate, capital, consumption and utility
for 𝜀 = 0.1 and 𝜀 = 𝜀 = 0, as in Figure 4. Figure 5A plots the discount rate 𝜌
𝑐 𝑘 𝜌
for time 𝑡 concerning agent #1 and Figure 5B is an enlarged part of 5A. Similarly,
Figures 5C and 5D show the capital 𝑘 and 5E and 5F show the consumption 𝑐.
Figures 5G and 5H are the values of the interval integral of utility 𝑈 from time 0 to 𝑡.
Figure 5A shows that agent #1 received four interactions. In Figure 5B, the discount rate
𝜌 increases around time 𝑡 = 7.8. Accordingly, Figure 5F shows that the consumption
𝑐 once increases discontinuously. After that, as in Figures 5D and 5F, capital 𝑘 and
consumption 𝑐 follow an adjustment path and converge to a new saddle point. At the
new saddle point, capital 𝑘 and consumption 𝑐 are lower than before the increase in
discount rate 𝜌. This finding is opposite to the trend in Figure 3. The comparison of
consumption with others induces the agent’s consumption once; however, it leads to a
lower level of economic behaviour in the future. Figure 5H shows a slight inflexion in
the curve of utility 𝑈 due to the change in the discount rate 𝜌.
Figures 6A–6D show the results of calculating the mean and coefficient of variation
(CV) of the discount rate 𝜌(𝑡 ), capital 𝑘(𝑡 ), consumption 𝑐(𝑡 ) and utility
𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝑈 for the interaction parameter 𝜀 and the reference parameter 𝜀 . CV is the square
𝑘 𝜌
root of the variance divided by the mean value and it measures inequality. The
horizontal axis is 𝜀 , the first vertical axis is the mean and the second is the CV. The
𝑘
mean for 𝜀 = 0 is shown in navy and the CV in light navy and the mean for 𝜀 = 0.1
𝜌 𝜌
in green and the CV in light green. Similarly, Figures 6E–6H show the calculation
results for the interaction parameter 𝜀 . Figures 6A–6D show that the capital interaction
𝑐
𝜀 works in the direction of lowering the discount rate 𝜌(𝑡 ), which raises capital
𝑘 𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝑘(𝑡 ), consumption 𝑐(𝑡 ) and utility 𝑈. The values of CV are generally small, as
𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑚𝑎𝑥is the effect of the social norm reference 𝜀 . Comparing the CV of 𝑘(𝑡 ) and the
𝜌 𝑚𝑎𝑥
CV of 𝑐(𝑡 ) shows that the former is larger. In Figures 6E–6H, the consumption
𝑚𝑎𝑥
interaction 𝜀 raises the discount rate 𝜌(𝑡 ) more than the capital interaction 𝜀 ,
𝑐 𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑘
which in turn lowers capital 𝑘(𝑡 ), consumption 𝑐(𝑡 ) and utility 𝑈. Compared
𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑚𝑎𝑥
to 𝜀 , 𝜀 has a generally more significant impact on CV. The impact on the CV of
𝑘 𝑐
capital is larger than that of consumption and utility. The social norm illumination 𝜀
𝜌
reduces the increase in the discount rate 𝜌(𝑡 ) and increases capital 𝑘(𝑡 ),
𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑚𝑎𝑥
consumption 𝑐(𝑡 ) and utility 𝑈. For 𝜀 = 0.3 and 𝜀 = 0, the CV of 𝑘(𝑡 )
𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑐 𝜌 𝑚𝑎𝑥
reaches 0.225 for the mean 1.82, corresponding to an increase in the Gini index of
0.14 when calculated from the distribution of 𝑘(𝑡 ). When 𝜀 = 0 changes to 0.1,
𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝜌
the CV drops to 0.09 𝑎𝑛𝑑 the incremental Gini index falls to 0.05. These results
suggest that higher discount rates create capital (wealth) inequality and that social
norms that discourage waste are essential.

The plots of 𝑘(𝑡 ) in Figures 7A, 7C, 7E and 7G generally ride on the curve

𝑚𝑎𝑥
and 7H generally ride on the curve represented by equation (6) (see graph of 𝑘∗ and 𝑐∗
at the saddle point for 𝜌 in Figure 11A). In Figures 7A–7D, the plots are scattered on
the lower side of the curve and in Figures 7E–7H, the plots are scattered on the upper
side of the curve. In the former, 𝜌(𝑡 ) decreases with 𝜀 , showing the intermediate
𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑘
steps until convergence to a new saddle point, where capital 𝑘 and consumption 𝑐
become larger. In the latter, 𝜌(𝑡 ) increases with 𝜀 , showing the intermediate steps
𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑐
until convergence to a new saddle point, where capital 𝑘 and consumption 𝑐 become
smaller. Comparing Figures 7G and 7H with Figures 7C and 7D, the impact of 𝜀 on
𝑐
the discount rate 𝜌(𝑡 ) is more significant than that of 𝜀 . The curved shape is more
𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑘
clearly visible in Figure 7G and 7H than in Figure 7C and 7D because the range of the
discount rate 𝜌(𝑡 ) is wider due to 𝜀 than due to 𝜀 .
𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑐 𝑘Figure 8 plots utility 𝑈 over an infinite horizon against capital 𝑘(𝑡 ) and

0.1 and 𝜀 = 𝜀 = 0. Figures 8G and 8H show the case where the settings of 8E and
𝑘 𝜌
8F change to 𝜀 = 0.3. Comparing Figures 8C and 8D with Figures 8A and 8B shows
𝑐
that as the capital interaction 𝜀 increases, utility 𝑈 increases overall and its
𝑘
distribution widens. Comparing Figures 8G and 8H with Figures 8E and 8F shows that
as the consumption interaction 𝜀 increases, utility 𝑈 decreases overall and the shape
𝑐
of its distribution changes. Comparing Figures 8A–8D and Figures 8E–8H reveals
difference in the tendency of 𝜀 and 𝜀 to affect the distribution of utility 𝑈. For 𝜀 ,
𝑘 𝑐 𝑘
the distribution moves toward the upper right, where 𝑈 and 𝑘(𝑡 ) or 𝑐(𝑡 )
𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑚𝑎𝑥
become larger. In contrast, for 𝜀 , the distribution once moves toward the upper left,
𝑐
where 𝑈 increases and 𝑘(𝑡 ) or 𝑐(𝑡 ) decreases while 𝜀 is small. It then
𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑐
moves toward the lower left, where 𝑈 and 𝑘(𝑡 ) or 𝑐(𝑡 ) decrease as 𝜀
𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑐
becomes large.

The shape of Figure 9E is intermediate between 9A and 9C and the shape of Figure 9F

the average of the values shown in 9A–9D). Although not shown in Figure 9, the CVs

however, the reference to social norms results in a smaller mean for 𝜌(𝑡 ) and

We formulated changes in the discount rate (time preference) based on the
intercomparison of capital or consumption among agents and reference to social norms
by connecting the Ramsey–Cass–Koopmans model of dynamic macroeconomics and
the agent interaction model of microeconomics. This approach revealed that interactions
with others affect the discount rate and produce inequality in capital (wealth) and utility
and that references to social norms reduce changes in the discount rate and inequality.
Specifically, when the interaction parameter with others 𝜀 = 0.3 in Figure 6, the
𝑐
coefficient of variation increases to 0.225 and the Gini index increases by 0.14 as the
discount rate 𝜌 changes. In this case, when the social norm reference parameter 𝜀 =
𝜌
0.1, the coefficient of variation drops to 0.09 and the increment of the Gini index falls
to 0.05.
A cohort study (Epper et al., 2020) divides participant groups into tertiles according to
time preference (patience), showing that the wealth difference between the top and
bottom time preference groups is in the 7–8 percentile. The difference between the top
and bottom tertile is roughly 2σ (twice the standard deviation); thus, the wealth
difference translates into a coefficient of variation of about 4%, which corresponds
approximately to cases 𝜀 ~0.3 or 𝜀 ~0.1 in Figure 6. This result can be interpreted
𝑘 𝑐
as follows: if every individual had the same time preference at birth, as they grow up,
their time preferences would gradually diverge due to their interactions with others,
resulting in wealth inequality.
A cross-cultural study on time preference (Reiger et al., 2021) calculates universal time
preference (UTP) for 117 countries by integrating various survey data, including
discount rate data from reference (Wang et al. 2016). A larger UTP means a smaller
discount rate. Figure 10 uses UTP data and World Bank Gini index data to UTP and the
Gini index for 104 countries (The World Bank). UTP and the Gini index have a weak
correlation, although considerable variation occurs among countries due to economic
conditions and cultural differences. The regression line indicates that the difference in
the Gini index relative to the maximum difference in UTP is about 0.15, which
corresponds to the case 𝜀 ~0.3 in Figure 6. Social norms, including rules and culture,
𝑐
are fostered by mutual recognition (Heath, 2008); thus, we can infer that at least part ofthe difference in the Gini index is caused by differences in time preference due to
interaction with others. The red dots in Figure 10 indicate Islamic states, which are
roughly below the regression line. This finding may be because Islamic states have laws
(Sharia) that discourage waste compared to capitalist states.
Figure 10: Universal time preference and Gini Index
Comparing Figures 6B and 6C and Figures 6F and 6G shows that the impact of the
coefficient of variation of capital 𝑘 from its interaction with others, 𝜀 and 𝜀 , is
𝑘 𝑐
larger than that of consumption 𝑐. This finding is explained in Figure 11. Figure 11A
graphs capital 𝑘∗ and consumption 𝑐∗ at the saddle point concerning the discount rate
𝜌 using equations (5) and (6); 11B is a graph depicting the derivative 𝑘∗′ of 𝑘∗ and
the derivative 𝑐∗′ of 𝑐∗ for 𝜌. Figure 11B shows that the absolute value of 𝑘∗′ is
larger than the absolute value of 𝑐∗′; therefore, the impact of 𝑘 from a change in 𝜌 is
larger than that of 𝑐. This outcome suggests that interaction with others has a more
significant impact on capital (wealth) inequality than consumption. The impact of the
CV of utility 𝑈 from 𝜀 and 𝜀 is even smaller than that of 𝑘 and 𝑐 because the
𝑘 𝑐
impact of 𝑐 is smaller than that of 𝑘, 𝑈 is a function of 𝑐 and the integral value 𝑈from time 𝑡 = 0 is less sensitive than the instantaneous value of 𝑘 and 𝑐. This result
is reflected in the slight inflexion of the curve in Figures 3G and 5G. Figures 6D and 6H
show that the CV of 𝑈 is about 8%, e.g. the CV of the well-being measured value in
the literature (Pontin et al., 2013) is 23%. Among the various constituent factors of
well-being, utility based on consumption accounts for about 1/3 of well-being; therefore,
the value of the CV of 𝑈 itself is not small.
Figure 11: Capital 𝑘∗ and consumption 𝑐∗ at saddle point for discount rate 𝜌
Comparing the left and right pairs in Figure 6, such as 6A and 6E, 6B and 6F and 6C
and 6G, the impact of 𝜀 on the mean and coefficient of variation of 𝜌(𝑡 ),
𝑐 𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝑘(𝑡 ), 𝑐(𝑡 ) and 𝑈 is larger than that of 𝜀 because equations (20) and (21)
𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑘
represent interactions. Looking at these, 𝜀 works in the direction of increasing the
𝑐
discount rate 𝜌 and 𝜀 decreases it. 𝜌 is expressed as the multiplication of 𝜀
𝑘 𝑁𝐸𝑊 𝑐
and 𝜀 concerning the original 𝜌 ; therefore, as the interaction is repeated, the
𝑘 𝑂𝐿𝐷
difference between 𝜌 and 𝜌 (𝜌 −𝜌 ) gradually increases for 𝜀 and
𝑁𝐸𝑊 𝑂𝐿𝐷 𝑁𝐸𝑊 𝑂𝐿𝐷 𝑐
decreases for 𝜀 , i.e. the impact of 𝜀 on the change in 𝜌 is larger than that of 𝜀 .
𝑘 𝑐 𝑘
This finding suggests that consumption interactions impact capital (wealth) inequality
more than capital interactions.
Figure 6 shows the impacts of the social norm reference 𝜀 on 𝜌(𝑡 ), 𝑘(𝑡 ),
𝜌 𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝑐(𝑡 ) and 𝑈 are larger on the 𝜀 side and smaller on the 𝜀 side because, as
𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑐 𝑘
mentioned in the above paragraph, the change in 𝜌 is larger for 𝜀 than for 𝜀 .
𝑐 𝑘
Therefore, the suppression effect of the change in 𝜌 by 𝜀 is more likely to appear.
𝜌Furthermore, the slight change in 𝜌 due to 𝜀 means that the value of 𝜌 is near the
𝑘
initial value 𝜌 = 0.223 and close to the normative discount rate 𝜌 = 0.2
0 𝑁𝑂𝑅𝑀
because this makes the (𝜌 −𝜌)⁄𝜌 term in equations (20) and (21) smaller. These
𝑁𝑂𝑅𝑀
findings suggest that social norms are more effective in reducing the impact of
consumption interactions on inequality than capital interactions. Note that if the 𝜌
𝑁𝑂𝑅𝑀
setting is too large (i.e. if the social norm is made too loose), 𝜌 will be larger and 𝑘
and 𝑐 will be smaller for 𝜀 = 0.1 than for 𝜀 = 0; this is shown in the case of
𝜌 𝜌
𝜀 = 0.3 in Figures 6A–6D. Conversely, a small setting of 𝜌 reduces waste, but
𝑘 𝑁𝑂𝑅𝑀
an excessive setting may lead to stinginess. Therefore, the setting of 𝜌 should be
𝑁𝑂𝑅𝑀
set between stinginess and wastefulness. Greek philosophy, Buddhism and Islamic law
also teach this.
The difference in the shape of the distribution of utility 𝑈 between Figures 8A–8D and
Figures 8E–8H can be interpreted as follows. In Figures 8A–8D, the new saddle points,
𝑘∗ and 𝑐∗, are larger because the capital interaction 𝜀 decreases the discount rate 𝜌
𝑘
and utility 𝑈 increases accordingly, i.e. it has a vector in the upper right direction of
the graph. Nonetheless, since a decrease in 𝜌 temporarily lowers consumption 𝑐, 𝑈, a
function of 𝑐, goes down; therefore, it has a vector in the lower direction of the graph.
Thus, the distribution of Figures 8A–8D will have superimposed vectors in the upper
right and lower directions. Conversely, in Figures 8E–8H, the consumption interaction
𝜀 increases 𝜌, 𝑘∗, 𝑐∗ and 𝑈 decrease and those distributions have vectors in the
𝑐
lower left direction of the graph; however, since an increase in 𝜌 temporarily raises
consumption 𝑐, 𝑈, a function of 𝑐, increases and has a vector in the upper direction of
the graph. Thus, the distribution of Figures 8E–8H will have superimposed vectors in
the lower left and upper directions. Previous studies have examined income and
well-being relationships (Killingsworth, 2023); in the future, it might be fruitful to
relate this to the graph of capital 𝑘 and utility 𝑈 in Figure 8.
Figure 9E, with randomly selected capital interaction 𝜀 and consumption interaction
𝑘
𝜀 , has a distribution shape intermediate between Figures 9A and 9C and a roughly
𝑐
mean intermediate value between them. Figure 9F also has a shape intermediate
between Figures 9B and 9D and a roughly mean intermediate value between them.
These indicate that the impacts of 𝜀 and 𝜀 on the discount rate 𝜌, capital 𝑘,
𝑘 𝑐consumption 𝑐 and utility 𝑈 can be treated as linear independence. The linearity of
the graph of means in Figure 6 also indicates that the impacts of 𝜀 and 𝜀 on 𝜌, 𝑘,
𝑘 𝑐
𝑐 and 𝑈 can be extrapolated. These are useful in examining various combinations of
𝜀 and 𝜀 . If we can understand whether individuals value capital or consumption in
𝑘 𝑐
their interactions with others, we can approximate the impact on capital (wealth) and
consumption. Although the coefficient of variation is an intermediate value, it is not an
average value and cannot be treated as linear independence; therefore, it must be
recalculated again when examining capital (wealth) and utility inequality.
The distribution shapes in Figures 2 and 4 show that the capital interaction 𝜀 and the
𝑘
consumption interaction 𝜀 generate distributions, i.e. inequalities, from initial uniform
𝑐
values; however, they are not power distributions, e.g. Pareto distribution (Newman,
2005), commonly found in wealth and income distributions. In other words, it is
reasonable to consider that inequalities brought by changes in time preference (discount
rate) based on interactions with others are part of the overall inequality. In contrast,
econophysics studies various distributions, such as power and gamma distributions, by
modelling asset exchange among agents based on the analogy of kinetic energy
exchange (Chatterjee & Chakrabarti, 2007; Chakrabarti, AS & BK 2010); however,
since these studies are physical analogies, they do not provide the same insight into
capital, consumption and utility dynamics as macroeconomics. To study inequality due
to factors other than time preference and macroeconomic dynamics, developing an
approach that connects the microeconomic interactions with dynamic macroeconomic
models would be helpful, as presented in this study. This approach would lead to
generalizations beyond the findings of this study. Based on this study, instead of the
interaction model of time preference, it is possible to model the exchange of products
(market) related to capital (Chatterjee & Chakrabarti, 2007; Chakrabarti AS & BK,
2010) and to model the interest and debt on capital, the production by joint ventures that
combine capital, the redistribution and mutual aid of capital (Kato & Hiroi, 2021; Kato,
2022; Kato, 2023). As a future development potential, this study’s approach could be
further extended by incorporating into the utility function not only consumption but also
natural capital, social common capital and social relationship capital related to
well-being.CONCLUSION
This study presented a new model that connects the interaction effects of
intercomparisons between individuals and others and references to social norms on time
preferences to a dynamic macroeconomic model. Through this, we estimated the impact
of changes in time preference (discount rate) on capital, consumption and utility and the
inequality (coefficient of variation, Gini index) resulting from these changes. The new
findings are that (i) interactions with others significantly impact capital (wealth)
inequality more than consumption. (ii) Among interactions with others,
intercomparisons of consumption have a more significant impact on capital inequality
and (iii) social norms effectively reduce the impact of consumption on inequality. These
findings reaffirm the importance of social norms against waste. Our supporting evidence
indicates that the quantitative impact of the time preference interaction on wealth
inequality corresponds to survey data from cohort and cross-cultural studies and that it
has no small impact on utility inequality.
Previous studies have shown that multiple psychological motivations and factors, as
well as mutual recognition and shared expectations of social groups, are essential for
time preference; however, no specific mathematical model exists for these factors and
time preference. Therefore, we formulated the interactions on time preferences as
relative capital, consumption and social norm comparisons. Future behavioural
economic research on time preferences could improve this study’s model to provide
further insights. Moreover, this study’s approach of connecting microeconomic
interactions with dynamic macroeconomic models can be expanded to model exchange,
interest and debt, redistribution and mutual aid.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
