In 2017, Cambridge University Press named populism their ’word of the year’. In the wake of the successful
Brexit campaign and Trump’s election as American president, populism became an important way to un-
derstandtheseunfoldingevents. Inthepastsevenyears, theconcepthasremainedimportant, withpopulist
leaders elected in many advanced democracies, and with populists often testing or eroding checks and bal-
ances when elected (Meyer 2024). As such, the measurement of populist rhetoric has remained paramount
to a complete understanding of the current political landscape.
This measurement, however, has not always proved easy. Methods commonly used to gauge if political
representativesusepopulistlanguage-suchasholisticgrading(Hawkins2009)orcontentanalysis(Rooduijn
and Pauwels 2011) - are very labour-intensive, often requiring several coders to evaluate the same speech.
As a result, full coverage of a system is uncommon, with coding often focusing on parties or politicians
that were already considered likely populists (e.g. Franzmann and Lewandowsky 2020; exceptions include
Dzebo et al. 2024; Hawkins et al. 2022). On the other hand, methods such as expert coding often get used
for the evaluation of parties’ populism through static means like manifestos (e.g. Rooduijn and Pauwels
2011). They may therefore not accurately gauge individual representatives who can use differing amounts
of populist language depending on context.
To combat this, scholars have increasingly employed computational methods to identify and analyze
populist rhetoric in political discourse (e.g. Di Cocco and Monechi 2022; Erhard et al. 2023). These
methods, if effective, may save a large amount of time and labour, allowing scholars to classify many more
politicians. This would allow researchers to more easily achieve full coverage of a oolitical system, rather
than only looking at likely populists or large parties. However, these methods have for now been used to
classifysentences(Erhardetal.2023;Klammetal.2023)orpartymanifestos(DiCoccoandMonechi2022),
not individual speeches or politicians.
In this paper, we develop a pipeline (i.e. process) to train and validate an automated classification
model which estimates the use of populist language. We use this pipeline to train models using speeches
of various American politicians, including governors and presidential candidates. We show that is pipeline
is effective at creating models that classify populist rhetoric in these politicians. It works effectively in a
variety of contexts, at both the speech- and politician-level, and with small amounts of training data. We
alsodeterminetheboundaryconditionsofthesemodels,showingwhereexactlyitseffectivenessdropsoff. In
doing so, we contribute to the body of literature that explores the uses and limits of large language models
in social science (Baden et al. 2022). We argue that the pipeline presented in this paper can become more

This paper is structured as follows. First, we discuss the concept of populism, and the ways in which
populist language is suitable for empirical analysis via computational approaches. Second, we introduce the
pipeline we use to fine-tune a large language model so that it can find populist language, and the datasets
we use to train and validate this pipeline. We then present the results, showing that the models created
through this pipeline are effective at detecting populism at the sentence-, speech-, and speaker-level. We
end by discussing the implications of this.
2 Literature review
2.1 Populism as Ideational Discourse
Theconceptofpopulismhasgainedsignificantattentioninpoliticalscienceresearch,withvariousapproaches
proposed for defining and measuring this complex phenomenon. These approaches include the ideational
approach, which conceptualizes populism as a set of ideas emphasizing a Manichean struggle between the
virtuous “people” and the corrupt “elite” (Hawkins and Kaltwasser 2018); the strategic approach, which
describes populism an individual’s strategic use of a large number of followers to gain political power (Wey-
land 2001, p. 12); and the performative or stylistic approach, which views populism as a political style
that emphasises “the people” over “the elite”, frequently contains bad manners, and often focuses on crises
(Moffitt 2016, p. 45).
Ofthese,theideationalapproachismostappropriateforthisstudy. Theideationaldefinitionofpopulism,
pioneered by scholars such as Cas Mudde (2004), considers populism as a “thin-centered ideology” that can
attach itself to diverse political platforms. It focuses on identifying the core populist ideas expressed in
politicaldiscourse,ratherthanassociatingpopulismwithspecificpolicypositionsorpoliticalstrategies. This
flexibility allows populism to manifest in both left-wing and right-wing variants, as it provides a discursive
framework for interpreting political reality rather than a comprehensive normative worldview (Mudde and
Kaltwasser 2013). At the same time, the clearly delineated definition allows it to be easily operationalised,
and has therefore become most widely used for empirical analysis (Meijers and Zaslove 2021).
The ideational approach’s emphasis on populism as a set of ideas aligns closely with the concept of
discursive framing in political communication research. Discursive frames are interpretive schemas that
shape how individuals perceive and make sense of political issues (Goffman 1974; Snow et al. 1986; Chong
and Druckman 2007). Political actors strategically employ frames to promote their preferred interpretation
3of reality and mobilize support for their positions. Populist ideas, when expressed in political discourse,
serve as a distinct discursive frame (Caiani and della Porta 2011). The populist frame is characterized by
a valorization of “the people”, a denigration of “the elite”, and a portrayal of politics as a moral struggle
between these two groups. By analyzing the presence and intensity of populist framing in political texts,
researchers can measure the degree of populist ideation employed by political actors.
This conceptualization of populism as a discursive phenomenon, rooted in the ideational approach, pro-
videsafoundationforsystematicassessmentofpopulistrhetoric. Researcherscanexaminepoliticaldiscourse
through this lens to evaluate the extent to which political actors employ populist ideas. Such an approach
facilitates the application of various methodological techniques to study populism as a framing strategy in
political communication.
2.2 Computational Approaches to Measuring Populist Discourse
The ideational approach’s operationalizable focus on populism as a discursive phenomenon has motivated
the development of systematic methods for measuring populist ideas in political texts. Early studies relied
on labour-intensive hand-coding by trained experts to identify populist discourse (Hawkins 2009; Rooduijn
et al. 2014; Hawkins et al. 2022; Jenne et al. 2021). However, the growing availability of large-scale digital
textdatahasspurredthedevelopmentofcomputationalmethodsforautomatedpopulistdiscourseanalysis.
Existingcomputationalapproachestomeasuringpopulistdiscourseincludedictionary-basedapproaches,
topic modeling, network-based methods, word embeddings, and fine-tuning large language models. In
dictionary-based analysis, researchers use predefined lists of populist keywords to measure the frequency
of populist language in texts (Rooduijn and Pauwels 2011). Topic modeling techniques, such as Latent
DirichletAllocation(LDA)(Bleietal.2003), havebeenusedtoidentifylatentthemesandtopicsassociated
with populist discourse in political text (Mu¨ller and Freudenthaler 2022). Network-based approaches have
been employed to analyze the co-occurrence of populist terms and phrases, revealing the underlying struc-
ture and relationships within populist discourse (Fern´andez Garc´ıa and Salgado 2020; Newth and Scopelliti
2023). Word embeddings, which represent words as dense vectors in a high-dimensional space, have been
used to capture the semantic similarities and relationships between populist and non-populist terms (Dai
and Kustov 2022).
Whiletheseapproacheshavecontributedtoourunderstandingofpopulistdiscourse,theyhavelimitations
in capturing the nuanced and context-dependent nature of populist expressions. Dictionary-methods rely
on predefined keywords lists, which can miss the subtle ways in which populist ideas are articulated. Topic
modeling and network-based approaches provide insights into the themes and relationships within populist
4discoursebutmaynotdirectlyidentifypopulistcontentatthesentencelevel. Wordembeddingmaycapture
semantic similarities, but creating accurate embeddings from scratch requires large amounts of data.
Fine-tuningalargelanguagemodel(LLM)offersamorenuancedapproachbecauseitcombinesthestrong
baseline understanding of LLM with the contextual information provided by human-coded examples. This
method takes an existing LLM as a baseline, and provides additional human-coded input, which allows the
modeltolearnthetextualpatternsinthatspecificcontext. Theuseofastrongbaselinemodeltheoretically
allowsforeffectiveperformanceevenwithlesstrainingdata. ArecentstudybyDiCoccoandMonechi(2022)
applied this method to measure populism in party manifestos. However, their approach has been critiqued
for its choice of training data. The study used full manifestos as input data, coding all sentences from
populist parties as populist. In response, Jankowski and Huber (2023) argued that this approach introduces
bias, as the models can rely on a wide range on concepts beyond populism to predict whether a setence
comes from a populist party. They emphasize that not every sentence from a populist party is inherently
populist.
OurstudyaddressesthismethodologicalchallengebyprovidinganexistingLLMwithacarefullycurated
dataset of sentences that have been coded as either populist or non-populist. By focusing on these clear
examples of populist discourse, we aim to improve the validity of automated fine-tuning approaches. Our
model learns to identify the specific textual features associated with populist ideas, rather than relying on
party-level labels or other potentially confounding factors. This targeted training data allows our model to
more accurately capture the subtleties of populist discourse in political speeches.
3 Data and Methods
As described above, our study fine-tunes an LLM by providing it a variety of populist and non-populist
sentences as training data to improve its contextual understanding. We then use the fine-tuned model to
classify speeches by having it classify all sentences in a speech. The percentage of the sentences in a speech
classified by the model as populist reveals the pervasiveness of populist language in that speech. To assess
the model’s validity, its classifications are compared against expert human coding. Below, we elaborate on
each step.
3.1 Baseline model
Asabaselinemodel,werelyonatransformermodelsimilartoBERT(BidirectionalEncoderRepresentations
from Transformers; Devlin et al. 2019), which is a pre-trained model that has gained widespread use in the
social sciences (e.g. Bosley et al. 2023; Shen et al. 2022; Erhard et al. 2023). Given a natural language
5input (such as a sentence), the model produces so-called embeddings as outputs, which are mathematical
representationsthatcapturethemeaningsofwordsincontext. BERT’strainingonlargebodiesoftextdata
hasgivenitanuancedbaselineunderstandingoflanguage. Inparticular,werelyontheSentence-transformers
framework (SBERT; Reimers and Gurevych 2019), which creates embeddings at the sentence-level rather
than for each word (for example by averaging all the embeddings), allowing for faster performance when
analysing full sentences while still retaining contextual information. This strong baseline understanding can
then be fine-tuned by providing high-quality training data on the concept of interest, enabling the model to
effectively adapt to the particular context.
3.2 Data
For fine-tuning and prediction, we use three separate datasets. The first comes from Dzebo et al. (2024),
who score the use of populist language in speeches from various American governors with terms between
2012 and 2020. For each governor term, four speeches are scored: (1) a campaign speech; (2) a state-
of-the-state speech; (3) a ribbon-cutting (ceremonial) speech; and (4) a famous speech. The speeches are
all scored on a scale of 0 (no populism at all) to 2 (strong populism throughout), up to a single decimal
point. This is done using holistic grading, with coders grading a speech based on their holistic assessment
and providing justification for their grading in coding rubrics. During processing, some speeches were not
imported correctly; only terms that contained at least three speeches were kept so that scores for different
governors could be compared. All in all, this means the dataset contains 288 speeches in total, coming from
73 terms in 37 distinct states.
Inaddition,werelyoncodedspeechesfrompresidentialcandidatesin2016,forwhichweusedthedataset
and rubrics from Hawkins (2016), discussed in Hawkins and Littvay (2019). This dataset contains 45 usable
speeches in total. The number of speeches coded was not evenly distributed among the seven candidates
coded: theeventualnominatedcandidates, DonaldTrumpandHillaryClinton, bothhad16speechesinthis
dataset, whilst other candidates had four coded speeches at most (Bernie Sanders 4; Ted Cruz and Marco
Rubio3; JohnKasich2; andBenCarson1). Sincethesespeecheswerefromthepresidentialcampaign, they
are all of the same type (namely ‘campaign’ speeches). Speeches were coded using the same holistic grading
method as described above.
Both datasets provide sentences which we can use to train the model. During the holistic grading
process, coders were instructed to provide justification for their scores in rubrics. This justification included
passages which the coders found particularly indicative of either populism or pluralism (considered as the
oppositeofpopulisminthatstudy). Wecollectthesepassagesandsplitthemintosentences. Becauseareal

Pauwels (2011), with speeches likely containing no more than double (Stuvland 2021, p. 78) – and the same
likely applies to pluralism, we add a third ‘neutral’ category of sentences to our training data. To enhance
the model’s discriminatory capacity, we systematically reviewed all speeches and extracted passages that
exemplifiedneitherpopulistnorpluralistrhetoric(seeAppendix4forexamplesacrossallcategories). These
sentencescombinedprovidethetrainingdataonthebasisofwhichamodelcanlearntodistinguishbetween
populist and non-populist sentences. For the governor data, this created a dataset of 1400 populist, 1009

148 pluralist sentences, and 140 neutral sentences. Both of these form the foundation for the fine-tuning of
two separate models.
Inaddition, totestthemodeltrainedongovernordata, weimportanadditionaldatasetofsixgovernors
from 2018 to 2022, coded using the same method as described above. Once again, four speeches were coded
for each governor, with a fifth for a single governor, giving us 25 speeches in total. This dataset allows us to
evaluate model performance for a different time period.
3.3 Fine-tuning
The fine-tuning is done using SetFit (Sentence Transformer Fine-Tuning; Tunstall et al. 2022), a pipeline
whichfine-tunesanalready-strongbaselinemodelbasedontheseembeddingstofindcommoncharacteristics
for each category (in this case: populist, pluralist, and neutral). SetFit allows for good performance even
with relatively little training data, increasing the applicability of the model. We tried several versions of
themodel, eachwithslightlydifferentparameters, eventuallyselectingthemostaccurateone(seeAppendix
1). Many versions of the model performed similarly, indicating good robustness. We ran the model with a
single epoch and a batch size of 6 for computational efficiency. All versions of the model ran with a 75/25
train/test split, meaning 75% of the sentences were used to train the model, and 25% were used to check its
performance.
For preprocessing, both the training passages and the speeches were split into sentences by punctuation
mark. Additionalpreprocessingsteps(suchaschangingallwordstolowercase,stemmingwords,andremov-
ing stop words), although generally important for automatic text analysis (Denny and Spirling 2018), are
not appropriate for our method, which incorporates contextual information. As such, these steps were not
taken.
One potential threat for the validity of the above method is ‘data leakage’ - namely that the training
sentences on which the model fine-tunes might come from the same speeches on which the model later
7classifies. If unchecked, this would mean the model scores sentences it has seen before. To address this, we
maintain a record of each sentence’s original speech context. This was either done through preprocessing or
bymatchingsentencespost-hoc. Thefunctionwecreatedwaseffectiveforcatchingmostpassages,mitigating

3.4 Prediction
Forpredictingtheuseofpopulistrhetoricinspeechesandbyspeakers,weemployabinaryclassifier(populist
ornon-populist)ratherthanthecontinuous0-2scaleusedintheoriginaldatasets. Inboththegovernorand
the presidential data, only few speeches were classified as very populist (1.5 or higher), leading to situations
ofdatasparsityatthoselevels. Bychangingittoabinaryclassifier,weensurethatthereareamplespeeches
in both categories. We chose 0.5 as the cut-off, as this means that there is the presence of at least some
populist language (Hawkins and Castanho Silva 2016). This modification alters the substantive focus of the
model, shifting from measuring the prevalence of populist language to detecting its presence. While this
approachismethodologicallymoreappropriate,wealsoprovidemodelperformanceresultsusingtheoriginal
continuous variables in Appendix 3.
To classify speeches, we only use the percentage of speeches that the model deemed populist. We found
that adding the percentage of sentences classified as pluralist had no impact on performance, and thus
decided not to use it in classification. Because this means speeches are classified based only on a single
parameter, a simple decision model is more appropriate than a more complex model like a Random Forest
algorithm (used in e.g. Di Cocco and Monechi 2022). Therefore, we use a decision tree classifier with the
maximum number of decisions as 1, meaning it chooses only a single cutoff. To show the models expected
results, results below show the modal value of 100 runs of a decision tree.
This same process was applied to test the effectiveness of the model at classifying speakers (governors
or presidential candidates). Speakers were classified as populist if their scores averaged to more than 0.5;
the model considered the percentage of all sentences made by a speaker that were classified as populist, and
classified the speaker as populist if this percentage exceeded the cutoff set by the decision tree.
84 Results
4.1 Model validity
We first test the model accuracy at the sentence-level. For completeness, we compute several metrics which
score model effectiveness. Precision, recall, and F1 are all commonly used metrics for classification tasks.
Precision determines the proportion of predicted positives that are actually positive (here, populist); recall
the proportion of true positives that were predicted as positives (percentage of populist sentences correctly
predicted); F1 combines the two scores for a more general judgment. Where appropriate, we also compute
the area under the ROC-curve (AuROC) and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) as two additional
metrics that consider both false positive and false negative rates. All metrics range from 0 to 1, where 0
usually indicates either randomness or complete failure and 1 indicates perfect predictive power.
The model achieves a 70 % accuracy for the presidential data and a slightly lower 66% accuracy for the
governor data, with F1 scores of 0.75 and 0.71 respectively. The full statistics can be found in table 1. This
is much better than random (which would be 33 %, since there are three roughly evenly sized categories),
and sits between F1 scores reported by Di Cocco and Monechi (2022) and those reported by Erhard et al.
(2023). Thisalignswithexpectations,asourtrainingdataismorefine-grainedthanthedatafromDiCocco
and Monechi (2022), who train based on entire manifestos where the populist content is thus more loosely
spread, but slightly less fine-grained than that of Erhard et al. (2023), who annotate individual sentences
rather than groups of sentences through a much more labour-intensive process.

Governors 0.66 0.73 0.69 0.71 0.70 0.50

Table 1: Hyperparameter tuning results
We ensure that the model detects populism - as opposed to related concepts like combativeness or other
rhetoric strategies - by examining the most erroneously classified speeches. This analysis shows that, for
all three datasets, the speeches with the largest discrepancy between predicted and actual populism were
speeches that contain a high degree of combativeness against the speaker’s opponent - California governor
Gavin Newsom opposing Republican contender Larry Elder and Minnesota governor Mark Dayton and
presidential candidate Hillary Clinton both opposing Donald Trump. Intuitively, this makes sense, because
populism’s black-and-white worldview often contains combative elements. Still, the two concepts also differ,
9and it would be concerning if the model did not distinguish between them.
Further analysis, however, eases concerns that our measure of populism is only a proxy for combative-
ness. For one, comparing our measure with measures of combativeness - such as a ’divisiveness’ dictionary
developed by Zhou et al. (2024) - shows moderate but not extreme agreement between the two measures
(r2 of 0.28–0.3),roughlyaswouldbeexpectedoftwotangentiallyrelatedconcepts. Furtherqualitativeanal-
ysisrevealsnumerousspeechesthatweredivisiveyetcorrectlyclassifiedasnon-populistbythemodel—such
as another speech from Hillary Clinton opposing Donald Trump. Conversely, the model accurately identi-
fied speeches employing populist rhetoric without divisive language, exemplified by a speech from Louisiana
Governor Bobby Jindal. These speeches are included in Appendix 5.
4.2 Model performance
The model trained on presidential data performs well. It predicts six of the seven presidential candidates
correctly, including three presidential candidates that use populist language (Carson, Trump, and Sanders.
It only misses Ted Cruz. It also predicts 40 out of the 45 speeches correctly, which includes identifying 17
out of 20 speeches with populist rhetoric (AuROC 0.89; F1 0.87; MCC 0.77). Figure 1 shows these results.
Figure 1: Confusion matrices for presidential candidates, speeches (left) and speakers (right)
The model trained on governor data performs worse when evaluating speeches of governors with 2010-
2018 terms. It correctly predicts 62 out of 77 governors, but identifies only 10 out of 17 populist governors
(AuROC 0.77; F1 0.69; MCC 0.60). Performance stays modest on the term level, classifying 244 of 288
speeches correctly, and identifying 48 of the 60 populist speeches (AuROC 0.72; F1 0.57; MCC 0.45). These
results can be found in figure 2.
10Figure 2: Confusion matrices for governors with 2010-2018 terms, speeches (left) and speakers (right)
Finally, the model performs well on the more recent governor data. It correctly predicts five of the six
governors, correctlyidentifyingDeSantisaspopulistandbutmissingNoemaspopulist. Atthespeechlevel,
it correctly classifies 24 out of 26 speeches and identifies all ten populist speeches (AuROC 0.89; F1 0.8;
MCC 0.71). Figure 3 displays these results.

Table 2 shows the relevant statistics for all three datasets. In addition to the statistics provided above,
wealsoincludethe’F2’-score. LikeF1,thiscombinesprecisionandrecallintoaholisticjudgment. However,
it weighs recall more highly, meaning biases towards punishing ’false negatives’. Here, the F2 score thus
more heavily penalizes false negatives—populist speeches not classified as populist. This metric aligns with
the model’s primary purpose of identifying populist rhetoric in political discourse.

4.3 Boundary conditions
4.3.1 Impact of context
To investigate the impact of context, we test the models in the opposite context. In other words, we test
the model trained on governor sentences on the speeches of presidential candidates, and vice versa. First,
we look at whether the general level of inferred populism changes. We find that, indeed, the proportion of
sentences thatgets gradedas populist dependsgreatly onthe context. Whenthemodel trainedon governor
data classifies the governor speeches, it classifies 21.9% of sentences as populist; this drops to 15.9% when
the model trained on presidential data classifies the governors. Conversely, when the model trained on
presidential data classifies presidential speeches, it classifies 21.6% of sentences as populist; this increases to
a staggering 46.8% when the governor data predicts it. This indicates that the training sentences from the
presidential context were likely more extreme and less subtle than those in the governor context, implying
that governors may use less extreme language when expressing populism.
Even though the number of sentences classified as populist changes greatly, performance remains strong
for all models. The model trained on presidential data achieves similar performance to even the model
trainedongovernordatadespitebeingadaptedtoadifferentcontext,withanaccuracyof86%andcatching
43 out of 60 populist speeches (AuROC 0.81; F1 0.68; MCC 0.60). The model trained on governor data
performs worse on presidential data, with an accuracy of 0.71 and catching 16 out of 20 populist speeches
(AuROC 0.72; F1 0.71; MCC 0.44).
In addition, we investigate the impact of speech type by testing the model trained on presidential candi-
datesoncampaignspeechesofgovernors. Sinceallspeechesmadeduringcandidacyarebynaturecampaign

to improve further. This turns out correct, although differences are minor and could have resulted from
12chance: AuROC, F1, and MCC scores all improve by between 0.00 and 0.08 (AuROC 0.81; F1 0.76; MCC
0.62). All metrics can be found in table 3.

Table 3: Model results in different contexts
In conclusion, these results indicate that context did not have a large impact on model performance in
this situation. The predictiveness of the training sentences - as indicated by the difference in accuracy of
the two models at the sentence level - seemed to have a greater influence on performance.
4.3.2 Impact of data sparsity
For the presidential data, the imbalanced nature of the data (with Trump and Clinton appearing more
frequently than other candidates), combined with the matching function removing sentences for speakers
when their speeches contains those sentences, means that Trump and especially Clinton have fewer training
sentencesthantheothercandidates(337and227respectively,comparedto400ormoreforothercandidates).
This allows us to gauge the impact of data sparsity on model performance. For this data, we see that model
performanceremainsstableforbothcandidates,withaccuracyforClintonremainingat68%,indicatingthat
as few as 75 training sentences per class may be enough for good performance.
To find out more, we run the model on the governor data several times, giving it an artificially reduced
number of sentences per category each time. The results of this can be found in table 4 and figure 1. The
modelshowsasteepdrop-offinperformancewhenfewerthan70trainingsentencespercategoryareavailable,
dropping in accuracy by 20%, in F1-score by 0.17, and in MCC by 0.29. This gives an early indication of
the minimum number of training sentences required for sufficient performance in this situation.

5 Discussion and Conclusion
In short, the pipeline presented above creates well-performing models that accurately capture populist
rhetoricinseveralcontextsandgivenmanydifferentstartingparameters. Encouragingly,themodelperforms
well with as few as 70 to 100 training sentences per category. This means it could likely be used in a variety
of situations, once that number of sentences has been collected. This would allow researchers to much more
easily get full coverage of a particular political system, which is usually very labour-intensive. In particular,
this more easily allows estimations on populist rhetoric in all political representatives, rather than focusing
only on parties or executives.
14Furthermore, the model could be changed to improve performance further. For example, our model only
runs on a single epoch now to save on computational expense. Running for multiple epochs or with a larger
batch would likely improve performance. In addition, we ignore sentence order in our current model, which
scholars in political communication have identified as a potentially relevant feature for political phenomena
(e.g. Baden et al. 2022, p. 4). Future research could further refine the model by including these factors.
The strong performance of this model despite the potential for further improvements, alongside the quick
development of LLMs, bodes well for the future of automatic text analysis in social science.
It runs counter to prior expectations that the model finds little impact of pluralism on the judgment
of the speech as populist. Initial research on holistic grading took this juxtaposition from the discursive
literature(Hawkins2009). Thisresearchquestionsthevalueofthiscontrast,suggestingthatperhapsalabel
of simply ’non-populist’ suffices.
The equivalent performance of the models in different contexts also runs counter to prior expectations.
Context differences are generally believed to play an important role in the expression of social concepts,
includingdifferencesinspeakingplatform(Schoonveldeetal.2019)anddifferencesbetweencountries(Baden
etal.2022). Theanalysisinthispaperindicatesthattheexpressionofpopulismdoesnotchangebetweenthe
sub-nationalandnationallevelsintheUnitedStates. Furtheranalysiswillneedtoshowwhetherthisresults
from the similarity of the two contexts (as both still pertained to the same political system), the concept
of populism being uniquely stable, or the general principle of context-instability not being as iron-clad as
previously believed.
As discussed above, error analysis shows that the model still struggles at times with the distinction be-
tween populism (which requires a Manichean worldview applied to the ’people’ and the elite) and broader
combativeness (which contains this Manichean element, but not necessarily the distinction between people
and elite). Future research may want to separate populism down into its subdimensions and have an auto-
matic text analysis model classify each (following e.g. Klamm et al. 2023). This is especially useful since
populism requires all elements (Wuttke et al. 2020). The coding rubrics provided in the datasets used for
this study (e.g. Dzebo et al. 2024) usually include separate sections for these elements. This can thus be
implemented using a similar pipeline to the one used in this study.

6.1 Hyperparameter tuning
We tried 3 different hyperparameters in addition to the default model. Firstly, we tried adding ‘differential
heads’, which allows the model to attend to different features of the language simultaneously. Secondly, we
tried ‘end-to-end training’, which allows the model to update a wider array of parameters when fine-tuning.
Finally, we tried a different embedding model than SBERT, called BGE-M3 (Chen et al., 2024). We also
tried all combinations of these changes. We tested all versions on the presidential data, because it would be
too computationally expensive to test this many versions of the model on the governor data because of the
larger dataset. In each case, we trained the model 10 times. In the end, the end-to-end training by itself
performed the best. See table 5 below for the full results, with the mean and standard deviation for each
setup over the 10 runs.
Based on these results, the model seems to perform well in many different configurations - including the
default configuration. This means it is likely robust and not dependent on the particular hyperparameters
we chose.

6.2 Discussion of matching
To avoid data leakage, the training sentences had to be matched to the speeches in which they were spoken.
The populist training sentences were always matched to the speeches in preprocessing, meaning they all
matched. The same goes for the pluralist sentences of the presidential dataset.
20Figure 5: Scatter plots for presidential candidates, speeches (left) and speakers (right).
For the governor data, this means that the pluralist and neutral sentences had to be matched post-hoc.
We did this using a function that looked at each sentence and tried to match it to the speech where it
appeared. This worked in most cases (though not all, because coders had sometimes changed the language
to make it gramatically correct). Specifically, 73% of pluralist and 82% of neutral sentences found a match
to a speech. However, this does not account for speeches which were lost during pre-processing (about 11.4
% of the sample), the training sentences of which therefore cannot find a match. In reality, this means that
about83%and93%ofpluralistandneutralsentencesrespectivelyfoundamatchingspeech. Fortheneutral
data of the presidential dataset, this number was 79 %.
Ensuring that this did not influence performance was one of the primary reasons why we also included
analysis on the more recent governors, the sentences of which the model had definitely never seen. The
stellar performance on this data indeed indicates that our function sufficiently excluded matches.
6.3 Performance as continuous variable
Below, in figures 1-3, we show the scatter plots that plot the correspondence between the proportion of
sentences predicted by the model as populist (x-axis) and the score given by human coders (y-axis). In all
cases, there was at least moderate correlation between the two scores. In each case, correlation was higher
for speakers, when compared to speeches. For the presidential candidates, r2 was 0.58 for speeches and 0.62
for speakers; for the governors with terms from 2010-2018, r2 was 0.39 for speeches and 0.42 for speakers;
for the governors with terms from 2018-2022, r2 was 0.49 for speeches and 0.74 for speakers

22Figure 8: Histogram showing the distribution of scores in all data
scores. In addition, there were only few very high scores (of 1,5 or higher), with only 14 of the 358 speeches
obtaining such a score. With so few high scores, we were concerned that the results would not be reliable at
that range. Thus, we decided to group the data into a binary variable, with at 0,5 as the cutoff.
6.4 Example sentences
Below are 10 randomly selected (via the ’random sample’ function in Python) sentences from each category
and dataset. It is evident that most sentences are indicative of the category they are in, while some lose
their significance when being split to the sentence level.
Populist, presidential candidates:
”We will all come together to say loudly, and clearly that the government of our great nation belongs to
all of us, not just a few wealthy campaign contributors”,
”And the only thing I say is hopefully, hopefully, our patriotic movement will overcome this terrible
23deception”,
”The press can’t write the kind of things they write, which are lies, lies, lies”,
”Buttherearestilltoomanypowerfulinterestsfightingtoprotecttheirownprofitsandprivilegesatthe

”But here’s the deal: the heroes at the Alamo, they are long gone”,
”Turning up the heat”,
”Bernard and his whole family, they’ve already voted”.
Pluralist, presidential candidates:
”Everyone should be respected by the law, and everyone should respect the law”,
”We stand up for religious and ethnic minorities, for women, for people with disabilities and we comport
ourselves with honor”,
”And if you agree – whether you’re a Democrat, Republican or independent – I hope you’ll join us”,
”You know, we need to come together around all of the issues that are important to everybody and as I
said in the beginning, whatever issue you care about, it’s going to be on the ballot”,
”I want to congratulate Senator Sanders on a hard fought race here”,
”I do this for my family, of course, for my sweet family, for my neighbors, for my friends of many, many,
many years, many of whom are working with me today—30, 40 years later”,
”Jobs that provide dignity and a future”,
24”Whether you care about new, good jobs with a rising incomes or you care about better education or
you care about what we can do to get the cost of prescription drugs down”,
”We had lost 350,000 jobs”,
”We have to rebuild our bridges, our airports, our hospitals in this country”,
Pluralist, governors:
”Instead of simply demonizing the other political party, we bring Democrats, Republicans, independents
together, instead of pitting business against labor or urban folks against rural folks or one side of the state
against the other”,
”Let’s get it solved on a national level”,
”That’s what I would like to see”,
”We can make it a bipartisan reality here in North Carolina”,
”They got rings in the ears and nose and other places that I don’t even know about”,
”And shortly after that he came to Cheyenne and announced more coal leases”,
”And during the last seven years, California has reduced the unemployment rate from 12”,

a hunter, that’s a good thing”,
”He promised eight years ago he’d cut people’s taxes, but he didn’t lower taxes for any”.

you. Now, even before I start, you know, it’s great to be in a church. I know, coming to church makes some
politicians a little nervous, but I start sweating. I don’t come into church very often. I’ve been to nearly
every church in Louisiana. I’m going to start off with just an old joke. I’m gonna warn you. It is an old
joke. I’m going to tell it to you anyway.

Given how long you’ve been sitting, maybe you can sympathise a little just kind of gration. Anyway, at
some point, the pasture is talking about a dear friend of his who had served in the Army who would who
had just passed and he talked about how he had lost his friend in the service. All of a sudden, a woman
woke up in the congregation and said, Pastor, what service was that the 930 or the 11 o’clock service?
Our guys an awesome God, amen.
I’m so excited to be here to talk about two of my favourite things, faith and freedom. Let’s start with
faith. You know, as an elected official, as a candidate, you get asked a lot of questions. today. I’ve talked to
themediaalldaylong. Iwillmedianationalmedia,they’llaskyouquestionsaboutschools,taxes,education,
all kinds of things. I remember the easiest question I was ever asked. It was my very first time running for
office. It was the last debate of that election. We were on live statewide TV. There were two candidates
26left. It was the last question. I had to answer the question first, they asked us this. They said what was the
single most important moment in your life?
Now remind you this is live TV. You can’t call a friend. There’s no timeouts. You can’t ask anybody for
advice. You got about 30 seconds to answer. You know, I’ve been blessed in my life. married to a beautiful

our second child. I’m going to talk about my wedding day, I could have talked about the first moments, I
held my baby in my hands.
Instead, this is what I said.
I said the single most important moment in my life, is the moment that I found Jesus Christ.
2:36 I was being honest, I would say it was a moment he found me. It’s not like he was the one that was
lost. I’m the one that was lost.
2:43 I want to share with you just briefly how I came to my faith, I had an overnight epiphany that only
took about seven years to happen.
2:51 Started with a best friend that came up to me on a school bus and said, Bobby, I’m gonna miss you
when you’re not in heaven.
2:59Now, Idon’tencouragemetogoandtellyourfriendsstufflikewhenyousaythingslikethatpeople
think you’re crazy.
3:05Mybestfriendplantedaseedofthegospelinmylife. Severalmonthslater,hegavemeaChristmas
present I did not want. He gave me my very first copy of the Bible. But he was smart. He gave me a Bible
with my name printed on gold letters on the front cover.
3:25 He knew I couldn’t return it, I couldn’t exchange it, I had to keep it.
3:31 God use that experience to plant another seed in my life. I didn’t open that Bible till many years
later when my grandfather suddenly died.
3:41 And I’d love to tell you, I open those pages. And the truth just jumped out at me. But it wasn’t
that easy. I was confused by what I read. But God use even that experience with Scripture to plant a seed.
And there are many people that planted a seed in my life. It was finally years later, when my best friend
that had given me this Bible invited me to come listen to him sing in his church, on the LSU campus.
4:04 And in the middle of that music, they showed a black and white film with an actor playing Jesus
being crucified.
4:10 And I don’t know why. But after all those years, God chose that moment to Hit me harder than
I’ve ever been hit before.
4:18 Nothing special about that movie, nothing special about that actor, except that God chose that
moment. When I saw the actor playing Jesus being crucified, it just hit me.
274:27 If that is really the Son of God,
4:31 and if he’s really up there on that cross dying because of me,
4:35 dying because of my sins, auto mean dying for all of humanity. That’s too easy. I mean, he is up
there because of bobby jindal. And what I have done and what I have failed to do.
4:47 How arrogant for me to do anything but get them on knees and worship him.
4:52 I have made it so complicated. It was as simple as that. youth pastor handed out cards and said if
you’ve not accepted Jesus Christ,
5:00 As your personal Lord and Saviour, we want to get to know you better. I filled out one of those
cards, and we started meeting every month, and then every week and then every day. And we started
reading scripture together, we started praying together. And as we read the New Testament, as we read the
Gospels, it was like the Bible have been written just for me. The words were jumping off the page. It was
like Jesus was talking me from 2000 years ago. And that’s why it was so important in that moment. And it
wassoeasyformetosayinthatmoment, thesinglemostimportantmomentinmylife, that’seasy. It’sthe
moment that I found Jesus Christ is the moment he found me. Now, the one lesson I hope you take away
from my testimony we all have our own testimonies, is the importance of planting seeds of the gospel, you
may change some of these life for all of eternity, and not even realise it.
5:55 Now, I’ve talked a little bit about my faith, I want to talk to you now I want to shift gears a little
bit and talk a little bit about freedom, and what’s going on in our country today. You know, there’s a lot
that President Obama is doing that worries me about our country.
6:08$18trillionofdebt,anEPAthat’stryingtosmotheroureconomy,Obamacare,wehavebureaucrats
between doctors and their patients. You’ve now got the Federal Department of Education trying to force
Common Core in our classrooms. You’ve got a foreign policy where we refused to stand with Israel, and
we’re about to allow Iran to become a nuclear power. You’ve got a president who won’t even name the
opponents we face in radical Islamic terrorists. But don’t worry, he’s keeping us safe from those mediaeval
Christians that might come back.
6:43 So much of this can be undone. So much of this can be undone when we get a conservative in the
White House. But the thing that worries me the most, is what the President is doing to redefine the idea
of the American dream, because the changes he’s making in our culture are going to be far more difficult
to change back. When you listen to this president, he tries to divide us. He tries to divide us by race, by
geography, by gender, by age by income. When he talks about the American dream, it’s about government
spending and borrowing. It’s about government dependence.
7:18 That’s not the government dream. That is the European nightmare. And the reason I feel so
strongly about this is my parents, they have lived the American dream. My dad’s one of nine. So the only
28one that got passed, the fifth grade in his family grew up in a house without electricity without running
water. I know because we heard these stories every single day growing up.
7:44 Good luck trying to get an allowance from a father like that.
7:49 But here’s the amazing thing about my parents, over 40 years ago, the very first time they’d ever
gotten on a plane, they flew halfway across the world to come to Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
8:03 You know, I tried to tell my kids, they don’t understand this. You couldn’t Google America. Back
then there was no online there were no computers at home. They had never even met somebody who had
visited Louisiana and can come back and tell them what it was like.
8:17 They were coming to an idea as much as they were coming to a place. They were coming to the
idea of freedom and opportunity. They were coming to the American dream. And you know what they
caught the American dream. They landed in Baton Rouge my mom went to LSU. My dad got his first job
by calling through the Yellow Pages, called company after company after company. Finally, a guy from a
railroad company told him he could start on Monday morning.
8:45 I love what my dad tells us new boss has even met him yet. says that’s great. So now Look, I don’t
have a car. I don’t have a driver’s licence. Does this new boss you’re gonna have to pick me up on the way
to work Monday morning.
8:59 The guy was so impressed by his enthusiasm, the work he did just that.
9:03 Six months later I was born. I was what you would politely call a pre existing condition.
9:13 That’s what I’ve been called worse. It’s okay.
9:16 All that meant was my parent’s insurance didn’t cover me and I love what my dad did next. I was
born in a woman’s Hospital in Baton Rouge where two of our three children were born. My dad went to the
doctor after I was born.
9:28 said look, insurance doesn’t cover our child’s birth. So I’m going to send you a check every month
until I pay this bill in full.
9:44Nopaperwork,nocontracts,nogovernmentprogramme. Justtwoguysshakinghandsinthehospital.
9:52 You know it was a simpler time back then. That’s what people used to do.
9:56 I asked my dad How did that work today.
10:00 Do you pay for a baby on layaway?
10:03 I mean, if you skip a payment, can they take the baby back? What do they do?
10:08 My father’s made it very clear. He said, Son, you were such a bad baby, we would have sent you
back. That was an option.
10:15 He said, Don’t worry, you’re paid for Don’t worry, nobody’s coming to take you. The reason I tell
you this, Mark Twain said, the older we get the smarter our parents become.
2910:25 I don’t know about you, I find myself turning into my parents more and more every day. I say
things I swore I would never say one of the things my dad used to tell my brother and me is that I’m not
leaving a famous last name or an inheritance. But I’ll make sure you get a great education. Because in this
country, there’s no limit on what you can accomplish. But it also tells us he said every day You should
thank God, that you are blessed to be born in the greatest country in the history of the world, the United
States of America.
11:02 I’m about you. I want my children and one day my grandchildren be able to say that same prayer.
And I worry about the assault on freedom, the redefinition the American dream, and we’re seeing it right
now. We’re seeing an unprecedented assault on our religious liberty rights in the United States of America.
11:25 A little over a year ago in February at the reagan library, I gave a speech outlining the upcoming
assault on religious liberty. It’s no longer upcoming folks, it is here. And it didn’t start in Indiana and
Arkansas. It didn’t start in the Hobby Lobby case where the Obama administration wanted to force the
green family to use their own money to pay for abortifacients to pay for abortions. The violated their
sincerely held religious beliefs. And it certainly it didn’t start. It didn’t start when the left got so mad at
PhilRobertsonforsayingthingsthattheydisagreewith. TheytriedtogetDuckDynastycancelledona&e.
And it certainly didn’t start this week, when Hillary Clinton stood up in New York and said, those of us
that are pro life,
12:10 those of us that are pro life need to have our religious beliefs changed.
12:16 Now listen to what she said we need to have our religious beliefs changed.
12:21Idon’tknowhowsheproposestodothat. Shedidn’tsuggestwhetherweshouldgotoreeducation
camps or how she intends to do that. But I’ve got news for her. My religious beliefs are not between me
and Hillary Clinton. My religious beliefs are between me and God. And we’re not.
12:46 We’re not changing our religious beliefs simply because they upset Hillary Clinton.
12:51NowwesawsomethingveryunusualinIndiana,wesawcorporateamericateamupwiththeradical
left to come after our religious liberty rights. Corporate America needs to be careful. The same radical left
that doesn’t want us to have religious liberty rights does not want us to have economic liberty rights. The
realityisthesameradicalleftthatdoesn’twantustohavereligiouslibertyrights,wantstotaxandregulate
these companies out of existence. I think profit is a dirty word. Corporate America needs to be careful. I
know that they think they succeeded in bullying those leaders in Indiana, but I’ve gotten used for them.
We’vegotlegislationinLouisiana,we’vealreadygotareligiousfreedomact,we’vegotlegislationthissession,

save their breath because corporate America is not gonna bully the governor of Louisiana when it comes to
religious liberty.
3013:53 And they need to understand there is no freedom of speech or freedom of association without
religiousliberty. IrejectthisnotionthatinAmerica,itisimpossiblehavereligiouslibertyandalsotogetrid
ofdiscrimination. Therealityiswecandoboth. Andtherealityisthis. Therealdiscriminationthatisbeing
faced today are Christians, individuals, families and business owners that shouldn’t have to choose between
operatingtheirbusinesses,andfollowingtheirconsciencetheirtraditionalviewstheirreligiousbeliefs. When
HillaryClintonsayswehavethefreedomofreligiousexpression,that’snotreligiousliberty. Allshemeansis
for a couple of hours a week we can say what we want in church. Religious Liberty means being able to live
our lives 24 hours a day, seven days a week according to our faith according to our conscience, according to
our beliefs. Now, this fight is bigger than marriage. I believe in traditional marriage between a man and a
woman and unlike President Obama and Secretary Clinton, the governor of Louisiana, his views my views.
They’re not evolving with the times. They’re not based on phone numbers.
15:00 This fight is bigger than even marriage though. This fight is about the definition of liberty and
freedom in the United States. The left thinks we’re not smart enough to have Second Amendment rights,
we’re not smart enough to have school choice. We’re not smart enough to drink a big gulp in New York,
we’re not smart enough to we’re not smart enough to buy our own health insurance. Now, they don’t think
we’re smart enough to live our own Lodge. Well, I’ve got a message to you at one time, the left the media
leaked the Hollywood elite, they used to believe in tolerance. And they still do they tolerate everybody
except those who happen to disagree with them.
15:34 It’s no coincidence, the one group they do want to discriminate against or evangelical Christians
with traditional views. So the only group, I think it’s okay to discriminate against, I’ve got a message for
the left. And I’ll say it simply and slowly, so they’ll understand it. It’s not real complicated.
15:49Youdon’thavetogotoHarvardLawtounderstandthiscouldhavesavedthepresidentthreeyears
a lot of tuition money.
15:54 He’s asked for his tuition money back, I’m not sure what he learned there anyway.
15:59 They certainly didn’t teach the constitution when he was there.
16:09 Here’s my message to Hollywood to the media leave. The United States of America did not create
religious liberty, religious liberty created the United States of America. And is the reason why
16:44 I want to close with this following observation. I told you about the American dream. And I told
you, all of my children and your children and grandchildren to be able to pray the same prayer that we are
blessed to be born and raised in the greatest country in the history of the world. But I will say this, we’ve
had a president for over six years now is trying to divide us. I do believe our best days are ahead of us. But
we’ve got to win this election. We’ve got to beat Hillary and I’m one of those that says, We don’t just need
to incremental change in DC. We don’t just need to like any republican we need big change in Washington,
31DC to get our country back on the right track.
17:25 But my final thought is this my parents, they loved India.
17:30 But when they left India, they were coming to America to be Americans. If they wanted to be
Indians, they would have stayed in India. If they wanted to raise their children as Indian Americans, or as
in New Jersey, anything else they wouldn’t have come here. My parents came here to raise Americans. I
don’t know about you.
17:56I’mtiredofthehyphenatedAmericans. We’renotAfricanAmericans. We’renotIndianAmericans
are not Asian Americans. We need to stop dividing ourselves. We are all Americans, Americans.
18:18 It used to be common sense to call America the great melting pot. It used to be common sense
to say that those that want to come here should want to be Americans. I’m tired of a commander in chief.
I’m tired of a president that seeks to delight in criticising America apologising for America. Our founding
fathers got it right.
18:35 Our founding fathers got it right. No external enemy can beat us but we can be beaten if we were
divided within the purpose of our governance, not to create rights is to secure our God given rights. This
is our time. This is our time, our four youth presidents that every generation has to renew for itself, our
principles of freedom. Previous generations have spilt blood and treasure to give us this inheritance. This
is our time. My parents knew what they were doing when they came here over 40 years ago in search of the
American dream. Let’s make sure the next generation gets a chance to live that American dream as well.
God bless y’all. Thank y’all very much. Welcome, si like so great to be with y’all.
6.5.2 Clinton
Hello, Dade City!
I am so excited about being here. Thank you, all for this really warm, wonderful welcome. And I thank,
on behalf of all of us I want to thank Alicia Machado for that introduction and for sharing her story with
us. Alicia will be voting for the very first time in this election, and I am very grateful for her support. I’m
also delighted that we’re joined today by your great senator Bill Nelson and his wife Grace.
IalsowanttothankRepresentativeAmandaHickmanfromtheFloridaStateHouse,MichaelCox,chair-
man of the Greater Pasco Chamber of Commerce, Michael Ledbetter, who is the Pasco County Democratic
executive committee chair and his wife Beverly. And thanks to retired Colonel Wilson Elton [inaudible] for
his pledge of allegiance. And thanks to all the elected officials here. And I especially want to thank all of
you for not just joining us but helping us to get out the vote in this last week!
It’s almost hard to believe, isn’t it? There are only seven days left in this election.
So are you ready to vote?
32Are you ready to volunteer these last seven days?
I hope too that you ready to elect Patrick Murphy to the United States Senate! Patrick, who’s been in
Congress, will be an independent voice for Florida families. And I am so excited to think about what he
could do, because unlike his opponent, he’s never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump.
Now somebody asked me the other day, ’Why do you keep coming back to Florida?’ Just look around
folks. I mean it is a beautiful, and I have lots of friends, but it’s also really important in this election.
Florida can decide who our next president is, which will affect the nation and the world. And I want to
make sure that every voter in Florida spends these next seven days thinking about what’s at stake in this
election. Because honestly I believe this may be the most important election of our lifetimes.
One week from today, we will be choosing our next president and commander-in-chief of the United
States. I don’t think the choice could be any clearer. I have spent my career fighting for children and
families. I have served in the United States Senate, served on the Senate Armed Services Committee. I was
in the Situation Room when we brought Osama Bin Laden to justice. I represented you as your secretary of
state, going to 112 countries, negotiating with friend and foe alike. I am ready to serve if you give me the
great honor of being your president.
Now, I do have to say that I think that stands in contrast to my opponent. And maybe for you if you
think about all of the issues that separate Donald Trump from me, it could be his dangerous statements
about nuclear weapons.
When a journalist told Donald Trump that people were worried about how casually he talks about using
nuclear weapons, he said, ’Well then why are we making them?’
And I have to tell you yesterday I was in Ohio, and I was introduced by a gentleman who was one of our
officers in charge of launching nuclear weapons if the order ever came from our president. And what he told
thecrowd—itwasabigcrowdatKentStateUniversity—Ithinkeveryvotershouldhear. Basically—his
namewasBruceBlair—hesaidthat, havinghadtheresponsibilityofsittinginabunker, beingresponsible
forthecodesandthekeystoournuclearweapons,heknowsthatwhenapresidentmakestheordertolaunch
a nuclear attack, there is no appeal. There is no veto. And that is why he has joined with dozens of former
Air Force officers to send a letter to say, ’We need a president with the temperament, the steadiness, the
calmness to be in charge of nuclear weapons.’ And therefore they cannot support Donald Trump, because
he does not have the temperament to be our commander-in-chief and handle those responsibilities.
So when you think about voting, early this week, voting next Tuesday, responsibility for our nuclear
weapons is on the ballot.
Soisimmigration. Dowewanttoroundupmillionsofpeoplewhoarehereworking,raisingtheirfamilies,
as he has suggested he will do? I don’t think so. I think what we want is to bring them out of the shadows
33so that they can’t be exploited by employers like Donald Trump, who refused to hire Americans and hired
undocumented workers so he could pay them less. I don’t think that’s right.
Now maybe for some of you, what Donald Trump said about prisoners of war will be enough reason to
voteagainsthim,somebodywhoquestionedthepatriotismandtheserviceofJohnMcCainbecausehewasa
prison of war. We need a Commander in Chief who respects the service and sacrifice of the men and women
who wear our uniform.
Or maybe for some of you, it’s what he said about a judge born in Indiana, who just happened to be
assignedthecasebroughtbypeoplewhoweredefraudedbythephonyTrumpUniversity. AndsoTrumpsaid,
’Well,wecan’ttrusthimbecausehisparentswereborninMexico.’ NowPaulRyan,theRepublicanSpeaker
oftheHouse,called—well,butwaitaminute,—hecalledwhatTrumpsaidaboutthatdistinguishedfederal
judge, ’The definition of a racist comment.’
And then Trump went on to attack a Gold Star family whose son, Captain Khan, died defending our
country, simply because that family was Muslim.
And then let’s not forget, Trump spent years, years insisting that President Obama was not born in the
United States, even after the birth certificate was produced. Honestly if this were something new, I think
we’d all be asking ourselves, ’Well, what does he have against President Obama?’ Or what does he have
against me? But this is not new. I know I’m reaching out to Republicans and Independents as well as
Democrats because I want to be the president for all Americans.
And here’s what I want you to tell. I want you to tell your Republican friends, in 1987 Donald Trump
took out a Donald Trump took out a $100,000 ad in the New York Times to criticize President Reagan. He
said, ’Our leaders are the laughing stock of the world.’ So this is a man who thinks that he is better than
President Reagan, better than President Obama – literally better than anybody, I guess. And, when you
thinkaboutit, whathesaidattheconvention, ’Ialonecanfixit,’ runscountertowhoweareasAmericans.
We work together.
So there are many reasons why I think it is fair to conclude that Donald Trump is unqualified and unfit
tobepresident. Buttoday,Iwanttojustspendafewminutesfocusinginparticularaboutwhathehassaid
and what he has done to woman and girls because – Any of you see the debates? I stood next to Donald for
four and a half hours during those three debates, proving conclusively I have the stamina to be President of
the United States. And during those debates, Donald always used to say, ’What have you been doing for 30
years?’ And I always found that kind of odd, because he could Google it and find out. And so I’ve been a
lawyer, and I’ve been a first lady, and I’ve been a senator, and I’ve been Secretary of State, and I’ve been
a wife and a mother and a grandmother and a friend and a churchgoer, and for my entire life I’ve been a
woman.
34AndwhenIthinkaboutwhatwenowknowaboutDonaldTrumpandwhathe’sbeendoingfor30years,
he sure has spent a lot of time demeaning, degrading, insulting, and assaulting women. And, I’ve got to
tell you, some of what we’ve learned – some of this stuff is very upsetting. I would, frankly, rather be here
talking about nearly anything else, like how we’re going to create good jobs and get the economy working
for everybody, not just those at the top. How we’re going to make college affordable for every single family,
because I have a plan that if your family makes less than $125,000, you will not pay tuition to go to a state
college or university. And if you’re above that, it will be debt free, and we will help you pay back the debt
you already have so you can get out from under it.
But I can’t just talk about all of the good things we want to do, because people are making up their
minds. Thisisaconsequentialchoice, sowe’vegottotalkaboutsomethingthat, frankly, ispainful, because
it matters. We can’t just wish it away. And a lot of his supporters don’t like to hear this. I don’t blame
them. If I were supporting him, I wouldn’t want to hear it either, to be honest. But I’ve got to tell you, I
learned way back in elementary school and I learned it in Sunday school: it’s not okay to insult people. It’s
not okay.
Andlookatwhathedoes. Hecallswomen’ugly,’’disgusting,’’nasty’allthetime. Hecallswomen’pigs,’
ratesbodiesonascalefrom1to10. WejustheardfromAlicia. ShewasMissUniversewhenDonaldTrump
owned the pageant. Well, he said she put on some weight and it made him angry, so he called her ’Miss
Piggy.’ Hecalledher’MissHousekeeping’becauseshe’sabeautifulLatina. Hebroughtabunchofreporters
to a gym to watch him order her around to exercise. Now, he also said, ’This is somebody who likes to eat.’
Well, I have to say: who doesn’t like to eat? I mean, really, can we just stop for a minute and reflect on the
absurdity of Donald Trump finding fault with Miss Universe?
But you’ve got to ask: why does he do these things? Who acts like this? And, I’ll tell you who: a bully,
that’s who. And thankfully, Alicia refuses to let such a small person get her down. She knows that Donald
Trump doesn’t get to decide her value in her eyes and in the eyes of her family and her friends.
But what about our girls? What about girls watching all this? What happens to their confidence, their
sense of self-worth? If you’ve got a daughter, a granddaughter, a sister, a mother, a wife, a good friend,
someone like this becoming president who insults more than half the population of the United States of
America? And what about our boys? This is not someone we want them looking up to.
Not so long ago, I was the mother of a teenage girl. And every day I tried to make sure that she knew
shewassmartandshewascapable,andI’mdoingthesamethingwithmygranddaughterandmygrandson.
Because, let’s be honest here, the world has a way of telling our girls exactly the opposite – they don’t look
right, they’re not thin enough, they don’t act right, no one will like them unless they change their clothes
or straighten their hair or stop being bossy, or whatever the criticism might be. Right?
35And I remember, when Chelsea was a teenager, I would wait on the second floor of the White House in
the long hall that’s there for her to come home from school. And sometimes, we only had a few minutes
together. But before she’d run off to talk to her friends or do whatever she was planning to, I would figure
out how was the day. We’d talk about what was on her mind. And that time together was really valuable
to me as a parent, because we parents, and I know there are a lot of parents here today, we work hard to
giveourkidsasenseofconfidencetosendthemoutintotheworldbelievingintheirownvalue, anditreally
is important that we don’t let anybody take that away from them. And we want them to be strong, and we
don’t want them to feel bad about themselves. And we’ve got to work hard to make sure our boys, just like
our girls, have that same sense of positive energy: not negative, not tearing people down – lifting people up
and respecting women.
In fact, all of us should respect each other in our country. So, when I look at my granddaughter and my
grandson, I am on the same mission. I want them to know they’re love, they’re cared for, they’re respected.
I want them to develop a good work ethic. I believe in hard work, and I want them to go out and prove
themselves in the world. But that’s what I want for every child. I have spent my life doing everything I
could to help kids and families. It will be the mission of my presidency. I will get up every day in the White
House trying to figure out: how can we knock down the barriers, overcome the challenges so that people
living here in Pasco County can get ahead and stay ahead?
So I know there’s work to be done. We can’t do it with just words alone. We’ve got to do more to stop
treatment about women being somehow objectified. And, oh my gosh, when we heard that tape and we
heard what he does to women. I’m not going to repeat it. But you know what Donald Trump was bragging
about: grabbingwomen,mistreatingwomen. AndIhavetotellyou,sincethattapecameout,twelvewomen
have come to say that, ’What he said on that tape is what he did to me.’
And then we heard his response. What he does at his rallies is to go after those women all over again,
insulting them. He said he couldn’t possibly have said those things because the women weren’t attractive
enough to assault. ’Look at her,’ he said about one woman. ’I don’t think so.’ About another, he said, ’She
wouldn’t be my first choice.’
He’s also on tape bragging with the radio personality Howard Stern about how he used to go backstage
at beauty pageants to barge in on the women while they were getting dressed. He said he did that — he
said he did that to ’inspect’ them. That was his word – and he said, ’I sort of get away with things like
that.’ And sure enough, contestants have come forward to say, ’Yes, that’s exactly what he did to us.’ Now,
as bad as that is, he didn’t just do it at the Miss USA pageant or the Miss Universe pageant. He’s also been
accused of doing it at the Miss Teen USA pageant. Contestants say that Donald Trump came in to look at
them when they were changing. Some of them were just 15 years old.
36We cannot hide from this. We’ve got to be willing to face it. This man wants to be president of the
United States of America and our First Lady, Michelle Obama, spoke for many of us when she said Donald
Trump’s words have shaken her to her core.
For a lot of women who have gone through something like this in your lives, that’s brought back painful
memories. And for men who would never, ever talk or act like Donald, it’s been shocking to see this. He
tried to explain it away as ’locker room talk,’ well, I’ll tell you what, a lot of professional athletes stood up
and said, ’Not in our locker rooms. That does not happen.’
Well, I guess the bottom line is he thinks belittling women makes him a bigger man.
And I don’t think there’s a woman anywhere who doesn’t know what that feels like.
He doesn’t look at us and see full human beings, with our dreams and purposes, our own capabilities.
And he has shown us that clearly throughout this campaign.
Well, he’sverywrong. Heiswrongaboutboththewomenandthemenofthiscountry. Hehasshownus
whoheis. LetusonTuesdayshowhimwhoweare. Wecanstandupforwhatwebelieve, whatwewantfor
our children and grandchildren, what we know is right. And you can go down the list of everything he has
said. He doesn’t believe in equal pay, he thinks pregnancy is an inconvenience, he won’t raise the minimum
wage, and he said if he comes home and dinner is not on the table, he gets angry. Instead of supporting
women who are out there supporting their families, he wants to make it even harder.
Well,Ihaveamessageforhim. We’regoingtofightforaffordablechildcare. We’regoingtofightforequal
payforallpeople. We’regoingtofightforpaidfamilyleave,we’regoingtofighttomakesureeverybodygets
raising wages in America and that’s important because so many people still struggling, still working hard,
raising a family, having a hard time getting all of their bills paid. And that’s especially true for minimum
wage workers — who — two-thirds of whom are women, so we’ve got work to do my friends. I’m excited
because I know we can do this and I will stand up and I will fight for you, I will work for you, I will give my
heart to this mission of making our country all it should be. Because instead of Donald Trump’s dangerous
and divisive vision, mine is positive, optimistic, hopeful and unifying.
But I can’t do any of this without your help. Early voting has already begun. Almost 26 millions
Americans have already voted and that includes four million right here in Florida. Americans are voting for
the kind of better future we can make together. And voting on all the issues that they care about. It may
be my name and Donald’s name on the ballot but everything you care about, our security, our economy,
bringing our country together, the environment, clean water and clean air!
Here in Dade City, you can vote every day from now until November 5th, from 7am to 7pm.
In fact, right now, the East Pasco Government Center is just a few minutes’ drive away. You can go
there right after this rally and vote. Because, we need everybody to stand up in this election.
37And if you have a mail-in ballot at home, send it in when you get home today.
Don’t wait to send it back! Talk friends and family and neighbors and co-workers.
DonaldTrump’sstrategyisprettysimple–hesaidhewantstosuppressyoungpeoplefromvotingwomen
from voting, people of color from voting, that is a lot of people. By showing up with the biggest turnout
ever we will show him and everybody a message that that is not who we are.
Now I know here in this county and this larger region, you probably know some people who are going to
vote for Trump. And here is what I want to ask you, I want you to talk with them. Ask them what they
care about. Ask them what kind of future they want for their economy. Because Donald Trump’s economic
plan is slashing taxes on the wealthy and big corporations. I have said that I want the wealthy to pay their
fair share and I will not raise taxes on anybody making less than $250,000 a year.
Sotherecouldnotbe,nomatterwhatyoucareabout,abiggerdifferencebetweenmeandDonaldTrump,
and I hope that you will come out and volunteer for these last seven days.
Wearesigningupforvolunteershiftsmakingcalls,knockingondoors,itreallymatters,turnoutmatters.
Please go to hillaryclinton.com to see how you can get involved. Here is what I want to leave you with.
You know, I feel like so many of you, our country is already great but we can make is greater. The main
reason America is great is because America is good. We are a big hearted, generous people. Not a small
minded people. We know that if everybody works together we will get farther together than if we separate
people, we push them down, we engage in all the negativity that we have heard too much in this campaign.
But sometimes, the fate of even the greatest nations lie in the balance. For America, this is one of those
make or break elections. It really is in your hands.
IhopeyouwillthinkabouthowyouwillfeelthedayaftertheelectiononNovember9th. arewegoingto
more forward together or are we going to move backwards by someone who wants to bully us? And I hope,
I hope you will think about how together we can make a difference, I want to be your partner as well as
your president, I want us to create the best possible future for our children and our grandchildren. That is
what I will work my heart out to do and I hope you will help me to make a better, fairer, stronger America.
Where we prove once and for all that love trumps hate!
Thank you all.”
