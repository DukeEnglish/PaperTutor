Abstract. Numerous studies have highlighted that atypical brain development,
particularly during infancy and toddlerhood, is linked to an increased likelihood
of being diagnosed with a neurodevelopmental condition, such as autism.
Accurate brain tissue segmentations for morphological analysis are essential in
numerous infant studies. However, due to ongoing white matter (WM)
myelination changing tissue contrast in T1- and T2-weighted images, automatic
tissue segmentation in 6-month infants is particularly difficult. On the other hand,
manual labeling by experts is time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this study,
we propose the first 8-tissue segmentation pipeline for six-month-old infant
brains. This pipeline utilizes domain adaptation (DA) techniques to leverage our
longitudinal data, including neonatal images segmented with the neonatal
Developing Human Connectome Project structural pipeline. Our pipeline takes
raw 6-month images as inputs and generates the 8-tissue segmentation as outputs,
forming an end-to-end segmentation pipeline. The segmented tissues include
WM, gray matter (GM), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), ventricles, cerebellum, basal
ganglia, brainstem, and hippocampus/amygdala. Cycle-Consistent Generative
Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) and Attention U-Net were employed to
achieve the image contrast transformation between neonatal and 6-month images
and perform tissue segmentation on the synthesized 6-month images (neonatal
images with 6-month intensity contrast), respectively. Moreover, we
incorporated the segmentation outputs from Infant Brain Extraction and Analysis
Toolbox (iBEAT) and another Attention U-Net to further enhance the
performance and construct the end-to-end segmentation pipeline. Our evaluation
with real 6-month images achieved a DICE score of 0.92, an HD95 of 1.6, and
an ASSD of 0.42.

1 Background
In recent years, there has been increasing interest in infant brain development,
characterized by rapid brain growth, and evolving cognitive and motor functions.
Neurobiological findings in early childhood suggest that early brain overgrowth may
be associated with autism [1]. A recent study has also shown autism phenotypes are
associated with variations in white matter development [2]. These studies illustrate the
significance of acquiring volumetric measurements in infants, emphasizing the
importance of such assessments in understanding developmental trajectories and
potential correlations with various neurological and neurodevelopmental conditions.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), as an advanced non-invasive and high-
resolution imaging technique, has underpinned remarkable advancements in the
medical field. However, it faces challenges during the 6-month period of infancy. One
primary challenge is the low tissue contrast between GM and WM due to rapid
myelination development [3], making them difficult to distinguish on the MRI scans.
Accurate brain tissue segmentations for morphological analysis are essential in
infant studies, but manual labeling by experts is time-consuming and labor-intensive.
Most existing image preprocessing software, such as FSL, is primarily designed for
adult brain segmentation and performs poorly on infant brain images due to low tissue
contrast and poor image quality [4]. Although the Infant Brain Extraction and Analysis
Toolbox (iBEAT) [5] is widely used in infant research for its efficiency in processing
and analyzing infant brain, it solely performs WM, GM and CSF segmentations.
Machine learning (ML) based solutions have also been proposed, with segmentation
algorithms achieving state-of-the-art performance on six-month infant brain datasets in
the iSeg-2017 and iSeg-2019 challenges [3, 6]. However, no participants have achieved
consistent performance across six-month infant datasets from multiple sites. Recently,
domain adaptation (DA) techniques have been suggested as a potential method to
improve performance in this task [6].
DA methods have gained increasing interest in the medical imaging field to mitigate
the distribution gap between training and test datasets. Generative adversarial network
(GAN) and its extensions, such as CycleGAN [7], are widely employed for image-to-
image translation to achieve image domain transformation between the target and
source domains. A study proposed a 3D CycleGAN-Seg network that leveraged 24-
month annotation to segment 6-month images [8]. Another study utilized annotation
from the 12-month images to segment 6-month images using the proposed semantics-
preserved GAN, and Transformer based multi-scale segmentation network [9].
However, all these studies focused solely on WM, GM and CSF segmentation. Other
brain tissues, including the ventricles, hippocampus, and cerebellum, also play crucial
roles in infant brain research.
In this paper, we introduce the first DA-based 8-tissue brain segmentation pipeline
for 6-month infants utilizing the annotation information from neonatal images
processed with the developing Human Connectome (dHCP neonatal structural pipeline
[10]). Tissue segmentations available as part of the dHCP pipeline include: CSF, GM,
WM, ventricle, cerebellum, basal ganglia, brainstem, and hippocampus/amygdala. To
obtain the best segmentation performance, we designed different combinations ofAutomatic 8-tissue Segmentation for 6-month Infant Brains 3
CycleGAN, Attention UNet, Voxelmorph, and iBEAT outputs and compared their
performances on real 6-month images. The highest segmentation performance was
achieved by the combination of CycleGAN, Attention UNet, and iBEAT, reaching a
DICE score of 0.92, an HD95 of 1.6, and an ASSD of 0.42 on the real 6-month T1w
and T2w images.
2 Methodology
2.1 Data Acquisition and Preprocessing
Fig. 1 The neonatal and 6-month images and corresponding histogram distributions of WM, GM
and CSF.
Participants: 43 subjects participated in this study as part of the Brain Imaging in
Babies (BIBS) project. The infants were born between 34 and 42 weeks of gestation,
comprising 22 males and 21 females in the cohort. All participants were scanned as
both neonates (see "Neonatal scans" below) and as 6-month-olds (see "6-month-old
infant scans" ).
Neonatal scans: T2w neonatal images were scanned between 37 and 44 weeks
postmenstrual age (PMA). Images were acquired on a Philips Achieva 3T scanner
equipped with a dedicated neonatal brain imaging system (NBIS) and a 32-channel
neonatal head coil. T2w images were obtained using a T2w turbo spin echo (TSE) with
fat suppression, TR = 12000 𝑚𝑠, TE = 156 𝑚𝑠, a resolution of 0.8 × 0.8 𝑚𝑚2 and a
slice thickness of 1.6 𝑚𝑚.
6-month-old infant scans: T1w and T2w 6-month images were scanned between 5
months to 7.7 months. Images were acquired on a 3T Phillips Scanner employed with
a 32-channel adult head coil. T2w images were obtained using Spin Echo with TR =
15000 𝑚𝑠, TE = 120 𝑚𝑠, a resolution of 0.86 × 0.86 𝑚𝑚2 and a slice thickness of 2
𝑚𝑚. The T1w images were acquired using Gradient Echo (GE) with TR = 12 𝑚𝑠,
echo time TE = 4.6 𝑚𝑠, a resolution of 0.78 × 0.78 𝑚𝑚2 and a slice thickness of 1.6
𝑚𝑚. Fig. 1 visualizes a comparison between 44 weeks neonatal and 6-month infant
images, along with their corresponding WM, GM and CSF histogram distributions.
Data preprocessing: We split the 43 participants into a training set (𝑛=33) and a test
set (𝑛 =10). The dHCP neonatal image preprocessing pipeline was applied to all 43
neonatal images, including motion correction, super-resolution reconstruction and
tissue segmentation [11]. We utilized the 8 brain tissue segmentation outputs for
subsequent experiments (excluding the “skull” output). The remaining segmentationAutomatic 8-tissue Segmentation for 6-month Infant Brains 4
outputs CSF, GM, WM, ventricle, cerebellum, basal ganglia, brainstem,
hippocampus/amygdala were used in the subsequent experiments.
For 6-month infant data, we designed a custom preprocessing pipeline that
included N4 bias correction, registration, separate brain skull removal for T1w and T2w
images using machine learning algorithm, cropping and resampling.
2.2 Machine learning models in pipelines
To investigate the best solution for segmenting our target dataset (6-month data), we
train and compare five different DL pipelines:
AUNet (baseline): A MONAI Attention UNet [12] was trained on the neonatal T2w
images and labels, then applied directly to real 6-month T2w images.
Cyc+AUNet: CycleGAN was employed to transform neonatal T2w images into
synthesized 6-month T2w images (neonatal images with 6-month intensity contrast).
At the same time, an Attention UNet was trained on these synthesized 6-month images
to predict their corresponding neonatal labels.
Cyc+AUNet+VM: Using the pre-trained Cyc+AUNet, we further employed
VoxelMorph [13] to register synthesized 6-month images to the real 6-month image
space (paired), and keep training the Attention UNet on the warped synthesized 6-
month images to predict warped neonatal labels.
Cyc+AUNet+iBEAT: We employed the same strategy as for Cyc+AUNet, but
replaced the WM, GM and CSF segmentation outputs of Cyc+AUNet with iBEAT
segmentation outputs.
Cyc+AUNet+iBEAT+AUNet: Finally, we trained a second Attention UNet on the
real 6-month images and their segmentation outputs from Cyc+AUNet+iBEAT.
Fig. 2 illustrates how CycleGAN, Attention UNet, VoxelMorph and iBEAT
cooperate with each other.

Network architectures:
Attention UNet (AUNet) is an extension of the traditional U-Net architecture, which
incorporates attention mechanisms to enhance the model's ability to focus on relevant
features. The model parameters were optimized using a combination of DICE loss and
Cross Entropy loss (CE), by minimizing the following loss function:
𝐿𝑜𝑠𝑠 =𝐿𝑜𝑠𝑠 (𝐴𝑈𝑁𝑒𝑡(𝑋),𝑌)+𝐿𝑜𝑠𝑠 (𝐴𝑈𝑁𝑒𝑡(𝑋),𝑌) ( 1 )
𝑠𝑒𝑔 𝐷𝐼𝐶𝐸 𝐶𝐸
CycleGAN (Cyc). The primary goal of CycleGAN is to learn mappings between
two different image domains in an unsupervised manner, which is particularly useful
in scenarios where obtaining paired data is difficult or expensive. The architecture of
CycleGAN involves two generators, 𝐺 and 𝐺 , along with two discriminators, 𝐷
𝐴𝐵 𝐵𝐴 𝐴
and 𝐷 . Here, we define the domain 𝐴 as the neonatal domain and the domain 𝐵 as
𝐵
the 6-month domain. Generator 𝐺 learns the mapping from neonatal images to 6-
𝐴𝐵
month images, such as the transformation from real neonatal images 𝑋𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑙 to
𝑛𝑒𝑜
synthesized 6-month images 𝑋𝑠𝑦𝑛 . Conversely, generator 𝐺 learns the inverse
6−𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑡ℎ 𝐵𝐴
mapping from 6-month images to neonatal images. The discriminators 𝐷 and 𝐷 are
𝐴 𝐵
responsible for distinguishing between real images and synthesized images. The
objective function of CycleGAN in Fig. 2 is defined as:
𝐿𝑜𝑠𝑠 =𝐿𝑜𝑠𝑠 (𝐺 ,𝐷 ;𝐺 ,𝐷 )+𝐿𝑜𝑠𝑠 (𝐺 ,𝐺 )
𝐶𝑦𝑐 𝑎𝑑𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑎𝑙 𝐴𝐵 𝐵 𝐵𝐴 𝐴 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦 𝐴𝐵 𝐵𝐴

𝑖𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑡𝑦 𝐴𝐵 𝐵𝐴 𝑠𝑒𝑔 6−𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑡ℎ 𝑛𝑒𝑜
where the 𝐿𝑜𝑠𝑠 encourages the generated images to become
𝑎𝑑𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑎𝑙
indistinguishable from the target domain, thereby facilitating domain translation and
image synthesis. The 𝐿𝑜𝑠𝑠 and 𝐿𝑜𝑠𝑠 encourage the bi-directional
𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦 𝑖𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑡𝑦
transformation consistency and the preservation of important features during the
translation process. The loss function from Attention UNet was also included to
contribute to the generation of synthesized 6-month images 𝑋𝑠𝑦𝑛 .
6−𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑡ℎ
VoxelMorph (VM) [13] registration model was employed to register the
synthesized 6-month images to the real 6-month images. This is because the contrast
transferred data (synthesized 6-month images) retained the neonatal cortical folding
pattern. This, in turn, has the potential to reduce the segmentation performance on the
real 6-month images, as the segmentation model is trained solely on images with
simpler neonatal cortical folding compared to real 6-month images. In this work, the
input to VoxelMorph are pairs of 3D moving (𝑀) and fixed (𝐹) images, where 𝑀
corresponding to the neonatal data, while 𝐹 corresponds to the 6-month data.
Specifically, VoxelMorph is trained to produce a deformation field ∅, which warps 𝑀
and its corresponding neonatal labels 𝑌 to obtain the warped moving image 𝑀(∅)
𝑛𝑒𝑜
and labels 𝑌 (∅) as the new inputs for the Attention UNet. The objective function
𝑛𝑒𝑜
is defined as the combination of the local normalized cross correlation loss (LNCC,
𝐿𝑜𝑠𝑠 ) and a regularization term 𝐿𝑜𝑠𝑠 .

where 𝑁 is the total number of voxels in the fixed image 𝐹, 𝑖 denotes the location of
each voxel, and 𝑠, the sliding window size of LNCC, is set to 15. 𝐹(𝑖) and 𝑀(∅(𝑖))
represent the intensity values at location 𝑖 in 𝐹 and 𝑀(∅). 𝐹̅ and 𝑀̅̅̅(̅̅∅̅̅) denote the
mean intensity values of the fixed and transformed moving images. The weight 𝜆 for
𝐿𝑜𝑠𝑠 is set to 0.6 based on the best segmentation performance obtained from a
𝑠𝑚𝑜𝑜𝑡ℎ
grid search of different 𝜆 values (0.1, 0.2,…0.9).
iBEAT [5] segmentation pipeline serves as an alternative method to address the
challenge posed by the complex cortical patterns in 6-month images. We fed real 6-
month T1w and T2w images, along with brain masks, into iBEAT to obtain
segmentation outputs for WM, GM and CSF. These outputs from iBEAT were then
utilized to replace the WM, GM, and CSF segmentation outputs from Cyc+AUNet.
2.3 Model implementation details
The 3D Attention UNet from Project Monai [14] was implemented with 5 encoder-
decoder blocks featuring 32, 64, 128, 256, and 512 filters, using a kernel size of 3 and
a stride of 2, with a learning rate of 0.0004.
For the 3D CycleGAN generators, UNet with 7 layers was employed, with channel
configurations of 64, 128, 256, 512, and 512. The discriminator comprised a 5 layers
PatchGAN, with filters of 64, 128, 256, 512, and 1. Convolutional layers in CycleGAN
had a kernel size of 3, a stride of 2, and were optimized with a learning rate of 0.0008.
The 3D VoxelMorph model consisted of 4 convolutional layers with filter sizes of
16, 32, 32, and 32 [15]. These layers utilized a kernel size of 3, a stride of 2, and were
optimized with a learning rate of 0.002.
All model parameters were optimized using the Adam optimizer, and experiments
were conducted on the NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPU.
3 Results
3.1 Test set and evaluation criteria
We utilized real 6-month images and manually corrected segmentation from 10
individuals as the test set to evaluate segmentation performance of different pipelines.
Using the same evaluation criteria, we calculated MONAI’s implementation [14] of the
DICE score, the 95th percentile Hausdorff distance (HD95) and the average
symmetric surface distance (ASSD) for each brain tissue. The results are presented in
Table 1. The segmented outputs of different pipelines are visualized in Fig. 3 and Fig.
4.
3.2 Quantitative comparison
The AUNet, as the baseline, was trained on the neonatal images and labels and
performed poorly on the real 6-month images, particularly in WM and GM
segmentations. It obtained an average DICE score of 0.74, an HD95 of 15.49 and anAutomatic 8-tissue Segmentation for 6-month Infant Brains 7
ASSD of 3.11 for whole brain segmentation (see Table 1). After applying image
contrast transfer, the Cyc+AUNet pipeline showed significant improvement (two-tailed
t-test, p=0.046) across most brain tissues compared to the baseline. The average DICE
score increased to 0.84, while HD95 and ASSD decreased to 3.07 and 0.66, respectively
(see Table 1).

To further improve segmentation accuracy for WM and GM, we first added a
Voxelmorph registration step. The Cyc+AUNet+VM pipeline shows that registration
improved the DICE scores of WM and GM from 0.73 to 0.77 and from 0.68 to 0.71
respectively. Another method, Cyc+AUNet+iBEAT, replaced the WM, GM and CSF
outputs with those from iBEAT, resulting in DICE scores for WM and GM increasing
to around 0.87, with HD95 and ASSD decreasing to around 1 and 0.4, respectively.
Although adding registration algorithm to the pipeline underperforms compared to
Cyc+AUNet+iBEAT, it slightly increased the DICE scores of WM, GM and CSF, and
significantly reduced the HD95 scores of ventricles, cerebellum and brainstem. The
Cyc+AUNet+iBEAT+AUNet, performing segmentation on real 6-month T1w andAutomatic 8-tissue Segmentation for 6-month Infant Brains 8
T2w images, exhibited the highest DICE score of 0.92, the lowest HD95 of 1.6, and the
lowest ASSD of 0.42, demonstrating the best overall segmentation performance.
We also conducted an ablation study that we trained the
Cyc+AUNet+iBEAT+AUNet pipeline using 6-month T1w and T2w images,
separately. the performance decreased compared to using both modalities at the same
time, obtaining a DICE of 0.89, an HD95 of 1.54 and an ASSD of 0.48 on T1 modality,
and a DICE of 0.90, an HD95 of 1.55 and an ASSD of 0.46 on T2 modality.

misclassification in pipeline 1 and 2. Pipeline 3 and 4 performed better, though some
misclassifications remain, as indicated by the yellow arrows.
Fig. 3 visualizes the 8-tissue segmentation comparison across different pipelines. Due
to the image contrast transformation provided by CycleGAN, the segmentation of the
basal ganglia, brainstem and hippocampus/amygdala is more accurate compared to
AUNet. Adding registration to Cyc+AUNet resulted in less noisy WM segmentation,
though it underperforms compared to Cyc+AUNet+iBEAT.Automatic 8-tissue Segmentation for 6-month Infant Brains 9

More detailed comparisons between Cyc+AUNet+iBEAT and
Cyc+AUNet+iBEAT+AUNet are visualized in Fig. 4. Adding a second Attention
UNet at the end to train a segmentation model on the real 6-month T1w and T2w images
improved the accuracy of WM segmentation in small structures, and this is highlighted
in Fig. 4 with the red circles.
4 Discussion
In this work, we utilized neonatal annotation information and a DA technique to
develop the first 8-tissue segmentation pipeline for six-month-old infant brains. To
satisfy the variability in modalities between individuals, we prepared the segmentation
models for T1 modality only, T2 modality only and both T1, T2 modalities together.
When leveraging both T1w and T2w information together, the model achieved the
highest performance with a DICE score of 0.92, an HD95 of 1.6, and an ASSD of 0.42.
When using a single modality as input, the performance decreased but not significantly
(two-tailed t-test, p=0.26), obtaining a DICE of 0.89, an HD95 of 1.54 and an ASSD of
0.48 on the T1 modality, and a DICE of 0.90, an HD95 of 1.55 and an ASSD of 0.46
on the T2 modality.
When we incorporated the longitudinal registration algorithm into the pipeline, it
resulted in less noisy and more accurate WM, GM, and CSF segmentations. However,
it did not outperform iBEAT’s cortical and WM performance, likely due to the
registration accuracy limited by the low tissue contrast and image quality of the 6-
month images.
The second Attention UNet at the end permits the training of a segmentation model
capable of performing 8-tissue segmentation on 6-month-old infant brain images. It
leverages tissue contrast from both T1w and T2w modalities, such as the contrast
between cortex and unmyelinated WM from T2w images and myelinated WM from T1Automatic 8-tissue Segmentation for 6-month Infant Brains 10
images. This approach results in higher performance compared to single-modality
segmentation.
The primary limitation of this work is the lack of data from other collection sites to
evaluate the model's performance and generalization ability. In future research, we aim
to acquire unseen datasets with varying acquisition parameters from different collection
sites to validate the model's generalization ability. The segmentation results will effort
to characterize potential associations between brain tissue features and atypical
neurodevelopment, such as underlying neural differences related to autism.
