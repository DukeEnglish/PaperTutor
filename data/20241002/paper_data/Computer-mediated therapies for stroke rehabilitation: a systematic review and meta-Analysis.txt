Abstract
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of different forms of virtual reality (VR) treatments as
either immersive virtual reality (IVR) or non-immersive virtual reality (NIVR) in comparison
to conventional therapy (CT) in improving physical and psychological status among stroke
patients.
METHODS: The literature search was conducted on seven databases: ACM Digital Library,
Medline (via PubMed), Cochrane, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, Scopus, and science direct.
The effect sizes of the main outcomes were calculated using Cohen’s d. Pooled results were
used to present an overall estimate of the treatment effect using a random-effects model.
RESULTS: A total of 22 randomized controlled trials were evaluated. 3 trials demonstrated
that immersive virtual reality improved upper limb activity, function and activity of daily life
in a way comparable to CT. 18 trials showed that NIVR had similar benefits to CT for upper
limb activity and function, balance and mobility, activities of daily living and participation. A
comparison between the different forms of VR showed that IVR may be more beneficial than
NIVR for upper limb training and activities of daily life.
CONCLUSIONS: This study found out that IVR therapies may be more effective than NIVR
but not CT to improve upper limb activity, function, and daily life activities. However, there
is no evidence of the durability of IVR treatment. More research involving studies with larger
samples is needed to assess the long-term effects and promising benefits of immersive virtual
reality technology.
1Introduction.
Stroke has been described as one of the significant causes of death and disability globally,
representing a severe problem for public health with a significant prevalence in men and
women of all ages 1,2. Recovery is always incomplete, and most survivors are left with motor,
sensory and cognitive impairments with a consequent increase in the burden of health care
expenses during adulthood 3.
Owing to the rising number of neurologically impaired survivors, several computer-mediated
programs for stroke rehabilitation have recently been developed to help patients regain their
ability to live independently. In particular, the advancement of digital technology has favored
the assertation of virtual reality (VR) as an accessible solution to give patients feedback on
their performance, meaningful goals, and a personalized experience to support motor learning
4,5. Training can be gamified through various applications, making the rehabilitation process
fun and enjoyable. VR is a real-time, computer-based, interactive, multisensory simulation
environment that enables users to engage in activities inside environments that resemble real-
world artifacts and events to varying degrees 6–8.
Depending on the quantity of visual sensory channels engaged in simulation, VR can be
categorized as either immersive or non-immersive. Immersive VR (IVR) replaces the user's
real-world environment with a simulated 9,10. Users get the sense of being transported into
three-dimensional interactive worlds through 360° immersion in an alternate reality such as a
head-mounted display (HMD) or video capture systems such as IREX, which enables them to
participate in various activities in imaginary environments11–13.
In non-immersive VR (NIVR), the user mainly interacts with virtual objects displayed either
in a 2D or 3D environment that can be directly manipulated on a conventional graphics
workstation using a keyboard and a mouse. As in IVR, animation and simulation are
interactively controlled to the user’s direct manipulation with some NIVR systems and allow
individuals to see their avatars reflected on the screen 14–17.
Non-immersive systems are characterized by a lower level of immersive features (e.g., scene
changes with head movements), which could play a role in supporting the feeling of presence
and its therapeutic benefits 13. For instance, it has already been pointed out how immersion in
the virtual simulation plays a pivotal role in pain management by inducing relaxation.
Previous reviews have studied the use of VR in the rehabilitation of stroke 18–21. However, none
of these works differentiated their results according to the VR modalities. Since the type of VR
seems to influence the rehabilitation outcomes differently depending on the level of immersion
18,19, it is vital to unravel which form yields the best treatment effects for motor rehabilitation
and other outcomes important to people with stroke such as quality of life and participation.
Hence, by differentiating between IVR and NIVR systems, this systematic review and meta-
analysis of randomized control trials aimed to evaluate the efficacy of VR treatments in
improving physical and psychological status in patients with stroke compared to conventional
therapy (CT).
Methods
Registration Number.
The review protocol and inclusion criteria were pre-specified and registered on the National
Health Service Prospero Database under the registration number: CRD42019134806. This
systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-
Analyses guidelines.
2Electronic searches.
The literature search was conducted on the following databases: MEDLINE (via PubMed),
Scopus, Web of Science, ACM Digital Library, and IEEE Xplore. Additional articles were
retrieved by scanning the reference lists of those studies that passed the "full-text" screening
stage. The search strategy was organized by extracting a set of keywords from three primary
groups representing:(i) technology, (ii) rehabilitation, and (iii) pathology-related semantic
fields. Terms were connected using the OR boolean operator for within-group connections and
the AND boolean operator between-group relations. Both free and MeSH terms were used to
build the final search string, reported in detail in Appendix I. Results obtained from the
database research were filtered to include only those published after 2015, chosen as the lower
temporal limit because Immersive Virtual reality is relatively a new technology, and its use in
neurological rehabilitation is still in the early stages. Other works were retrieved by scanning
the reference lists of all included studies.
Eligibility Criteria
To be included, articles had to meet the following eligibility criteria. (i) a randomized
controlled trial that (ii) considered subjects more than 18 years old, (ii) affected by neurological
disorders, (iii) and compared computer-mediated treatments against conventional therapy (iv)
for the upper limbs or lower limb motor functions (v) or postural control. Moreover, only full-
text articles written in English were included in the screening process. We excluded those
articles that: (i).compared one or more different types of computer-mediated reality-based
treatments without an alternative control group; (ii) involved high-cost devices such as
treadmills, CAVE, and any form of a robotic manipulator.
(iv) Other neurological conditions apart from a stroke.
Study selection.
In May 2020, we started a comprehensive systematic search. Duplicates across databases were
removed, and the remaining studies were screened for titles, abstracts, and descriptors by the
two reviewers independently (MS, MJ) to assess whether they met the predefined inclusion
criteria. Controversies between the reviewers concerning the eligibility were resolved in a
consensus meeting. After reaching an agreement, full texts of potentially eligible studies were
retrieved and further assessed against the inclusion criteria, and reasons for excluding the
studies were documented.
Risk of Bias
We used the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme for randomized controlled trials 22 to assess
the risk of bias in the included trials. It is 11 questions checklist with three sections that assess
the following items: validity of study results, what the results are, and how they are helpful
locally. Each question in each subsection required a positive('yes'), neutral (Can't tell), or
negative answer('No').
The articles were classified as low risk, moderate risk, or high risk of bias according to the
number of items that received a negative appraisal. Those articles in which all checklist items
were appraised positively were considered low risk of bias works. Articles in which one or two
of the checklist items were appraised negatively were considered a moderate risk of bias.
Articles in which three or more items were appraised negatively were considered high risk of
bias works.
The two authors independently assessed the quality of the work, and any disagreements that
arose during the process were resolved through discussion.
3Data Extraction.
Two review authors (MS and MJ) independently extracted data into a
a custom data table and the following data were chosen to be extracted from each study:
(i) citation details, (i) Population characteristics; (ii) inclusion and exclusion criteria (ii) Type
of intervention (iii) Technology Used (iv) outcome measures; (v) main results. One author (M.
S) extracted data, and another (M.J)checked for accuracy. For studies where values were
provided in an unconventional format (i.e., medians [interquartile range], or means [minimum-
maximum range]23–25) the sample mean and standard deviation were estimated as described in
Wan et al. 2014 26. From this, the effect sizes of the main outcomes were calculated.
Data synthesis
Two review authors (MS and MJ) independently classified outcome measures in terms of the
domain assessed ((i)Upper limb activity and function (ii) lower limb activity and function, (iii)
balance, (iv) activity of daily life, and (v) adverse events). When more than one outcome
measure for the same domain was presented in a study, the most frequently used across studies
was considered in the analysis. The standardized mean differences (SMD) were calculated for
continuous outcomes and Cochrane's Review Manager 5 (Review Manager 2014) software was
used for all analyses. The effect of the intervention was measured using cohen's d on the
primary outcome of each study. In trials with three-armed interventions 27, the VR therapy was
compared to conventional interventions.
Meta­analysis
Pooled results were used to present an overall estimate of the treatment effect using a random-
effects model in the analysis across studies. Heterogeneity was assessed through the I2 statistic
28. The level of heterogeneity was considered substantial if the I2 statistic was greater than 50%.
A meta-analysis was considered not appropriate where the level of heterogeneity was
substantial or when only one study was identified for the desired outcome. In this case, a
narrative summary of the results was given. Where data pooling was decided, forest plots were
provided along with a description of the results. When applicable, a sensitivity analysis was
performed, including only studies at low risk of bias, and the results were compared to the
primary analysis, including all the trials.
Results:
Search Results.
The study inclusion workflow is displayed in detail in Figure 1. We identified a total of 1573
possible record from the database research (ACM: n=18,Pubmed: n=1382, Cochrane: n=17,
IEEE: n=29, Science direct: n=60, Scopus: n=38, Web of Science: n=29). Additional 151
Records were identified through secondary sources. After removing records duplicates, 1680
studies were evaluated for title and abstract, resulting in 95 full-text articles assessed against
the previously defined eligibility criteria. At the end of this process, 22 full‐ text articles were
included in the present review (Adie et al. 2017; Allen et al. 2017; Aşkın et al. 2018; Choi,
Shin, and Bang 2019; Henrique et al. 2019; Huang and Chen 2020; Ikbali Afsar et al. 2018; In,
Lee, and Song 2016; Kiper et al. 2018; K. H. Kong et al. 2016; Llorens et al. 2015; McNulty
et al. 2015; Mekbib et al. 2021; Ögün et al. 2019; Pedreira da Fonseca et al. 2017; Saposnik et
al. 2016; Schuster-Amft et al. 2018; Shin et al. 2016; Shin, Bog Park, and Ho Jang 2015; Da
Silva Ribeiro et al. 2015; Bin Song et al. 2015; Zondervan et al. 2016. And these 2 studies 29,30
were excluded from the meta-analysis.
440 studies did not meet the inclusion criteria because they were published before 2015. 8 studies
were excluded from this review because the VR intervention methods used expensive devices
such as treadmills and robotic manipulators or actuated devices 31–36 37 3 studies were excluded
because they compared virtual reality with no intervention 38–40.
5Risk of bias.
The critical quality appraisal of the 22 included trials is presented in Table 1. Relying on the
CASP guidelines 22 for a randomized trial, we identified 2 of the included studies to be at high
risk of bias 42,47,3 at low risk of bias 17,46,54 and 17 at moderate risk of bias 8,23,25,27,29,30,41,43–45,48–
53,55. In 2 trials 42,47, the authors did not report the information about the randomization method
of patients. In 48, the treatment between groups was not the same. The experimental group
received 30 extra minutes of VR training for 20 sessions making up 10 hours. 7 studies reported
a large treatment effect of the Intervention measured using Cohen’s d 17,42,45,47–49,52,54, while the
rest had a medium to small effect size. It is also important to consider that small sample sizes
characterized most studies. A total of 13 studies Aşkın et al., 2018; Bin Song et al., 2015; Choi
et al., 2019; Da Silva Ribeiro et al., 2015; Huang & Chen, 2020; In et al., 2016; H.-C. Lee et
al., 2017; Llorens et al., 2015; McNulty et al., 2015; Mekbib et al., 2021; Pedreira da Fonseca
et al., 2017; Saposnik et al., 2016; Zondervan et al., 2016) had a small sample population of
about 10 to 16 participants in the experimental group, resulting in broader confidence intervals
and therefore were regarded to be of high risk of bias. Due to the nature of the study, blinding
of the patients, physiotherapists, and assessors who supervised the treatments was not possible.
Therefore it was not considered as a possible risk of bias.
Population Characteristics.
Of all 22 trials, 7 trials had a sample size of more than 50 participants 8,17,27,41,45,50,53. And 6
trials had less than 25 participants 47,49,51,52,55,56.
6Inclusion and Exclusion criteria
Most studies specified the inclusion and exclusion criteria apart from two where the exclusion
criteria were not given 42,49. Most Participants in the included studies appeared to be relatively
young, with mean ages ranging from 29 to 75 years in all studies. Studies omitted medically ill
participants, such as specified by the presence of a disease in which exercise was
contraindicated. Participants were included if they were cognitively intact, as defined by cut-
off scores on the MMSE. Medically unstable participants were excluded, as defined by having
a disease in which exercise was contraindicated, severe visual disorders 46,51,55 and
neurodegenerative disorders23.
Interventions.
In all retrieved trials, the active control group performed similar exercises as those proposed in
the VR intervention. For IVR, 3 studies implemented an equally matched dose of CT 17,53,55,
while 1 trial consisted of a combination of VR with CT 54.
For NIVR interventions, 7 trials had the intervention group that performed only VR exercises
8,27,29,41,42,44,46, 7 studies had a VR intervention group performing a combination of VR exercises
augmenting CT 23,25,30,45,48–51.
One trial consisted of three-armed interventions including a VR group, an active control group
performing similar exercises within a conventional physiotherapy setting, and a passive control
group 43.
In all trials, therapy sessions lasted between 45 minutes and 2 hours per day, with a minimum
duration of therapy lasting for 16 hours and a maximum of 40 hours.
Technology.
Participants in the IVR group received training using immersive devices such as head-mounted
displays 17,47,52, a leap motion controller 17,52, and Htc Vive controllers in 47. While For NIVR
interventions, participants mainly used the Microsoft Xbox Kinect connected to a display
monitor 23,42,46,48, Nintendo Wii gaming system 8,27,29,30,41,44,45, motion tracking sensors 25,50,51,
and data gloves 53–55.
A detailed overview of the IVR and NIVR interventions is provided in Table 4 and Table 5,
respectively.
7Outcomes.
Due to various intervention approaches, a wide range of outcome measures was retrieved. The
outcome measures were collected at the baseline and soon after the intervention. In all the trials,
a post-intervention follow-up assessment was done in only 7. Of these, 5 had a post-
intervention follow-up of less than 3 months 8,27,45,54,55, and 2 had more than 6 months 30,41. An
overview of all outcome measures for each predefined outcome category and results for the
primary outcome in the included studies can be found in tables 6 and 7 for IVR and NIVR
respectively.
Immersive Virtual Reality vs CT (Short term Effects)
Upper limb activity and function
Upper limb function was accessed using FM as the outcome measure. In 3 trials with 106
participants 17,47,52, improvements were reported in both training groups post-intervention. A
meta-analysis revealed significant inter group differences with greater improvements in the
IVR group compared to CT (smd:1.37, 95% CI [0.80, 1.93], I2=35%, P<0.00001). A forest plot
is shown in figure 2.
A sensitivity analysis of results without 47 considered to be a high risk of bias revealed similar
results(smd:1.57, 95% CI [1.03, 2.11], I2=15%, P=0.2).
Upper limb activity was assessed by BBT as the outcome measure. Results from one study 47
with 18 participants reported improvements in both groups. IVR registered a higher
improvement than CT. However, the difference between the groups was not significant
IVR:(0.08±0.14), CT(0.04±0.06), (smd= 0.35, 95% CI [-0.58, 1.29], p>0.05). This was a low-
quality study with large confidence intervals.
Activities of daily life (ADL)
Three trials 17,47,52 investigated the effects of IVR on ADL. A meta-analysis indicated greater
improvement in the IVR group with a moderate effect size (smd = 0.54 ,95% [CI 0.15 to 0.93],
I² = 0%, p=0.007). A forest plot is shown in figure 3.
A sensitivity analysis without 47 considered high risk of bias revealed similar results (smd =
0.61 ,95% [CI 0.18 to 1.04], I² = 0%, p=0.005).
Adverse events.
In all studies, the occurrence of adverse events was not reported.
Non­Immersive VR Vs CT (Short Term Effects)
Upper limb activity and function
Nine trials reported results on upper limb function using FM as the outcome measure
23,25,44,46,48,50,54,57. Significant improvements were reported in both groups post-intervention. A
meta-analysis was not performed because of high heterogeneity (I2 = 82%) in the data.
According to results from individual studies, NIVR reported greater improvements than CT.
Four trials with a total population of 172 participants reported greater improvement in NIVR
compared to CT with a large effect size , Aşkın et al. 2018 23,(NIVR:41.25±9.0,
CT:35.00±10.0, smd=0.64), Ikbali Afsar et al. 2018 48(NIVR:18.74±7.67, CT:13.94±6.58,
8smd=0.65), Shin et al. 2016 54 [NIVR:4.9±1.0, CT:1.4± 0.8, smd=3.71] and Henrique et al.
2019 46 [NIVR: 14.69±0.67, CT:9.07±1.34, smd = 5.22],
Four studies with a total of 265 participants reported no significant differences between the
groups. Kong et al. 2016 27 (NIVR:32.8±18.2, CT:29.2±17.25, smd=0.2), Kiper et al. 2018 50
(NIVR:47.1±15.74 , CT:46.29±17.25, smd=0.09) Shin, Bog Park, and Ho Jang 201525,
(NIVR:38.5±11.7, CT:33.87±17.64, SMD=0.3] and Da Silva Ribeiro et al. 201544 (NIVR:
38.7±19.6 CT: 44.7±14.2, smd=-0.34).
In one study 30, with 41 participants, we could not get data in a suitable format for analysis.
However, they reported no significant difference between groups.
Three trials with 109 participants measured upper limb activity using BBT as the
outcome measure 23,53,55. A meta-analysis revealed no significant difference between the
groups. The overall effect size was small (smd = 0.19, 95% CI [-0.19, 0.57], I2 = 0%, P=0.33)
as shown by a forest plot in figure 4.
lower limb activity and function
Three trials with a total of 92 participants used TUG to assess mobility, 42,45,49. Improvements
were reported in both groups post-intervention. A meta-analysis done revealed no significant
difference between the groups (smd = 0.33, 95% CI [-0.08, 0.75], I2 = 0% , P=0.11) as shown
by a forest plot in figure 5. A sensitivity analysis that excluded results from one study 42 deemed
to be a high risk of bias revealed similar results (smd = 0.34, 95% CI [-0.12, 0.81], I2 = 0%,
P=0.15).
In 3 trials with 65 participants, the 10mw Test was used as the outcome measure 42,45,51,
A meta-analysis revealed no significant difference between the groups (smd = -0.06, 95% CI
[-0.60, 0.48],I2 = 0% P=0.82). A forest plot is shown in figure 6. A sensitivity analysis which
excluded results from 42 (smd = -0.22, 95% CI [-1.00, 0.56] ,I2 = 42% P=0.58) revealed similar
results.
Balance.
Four trials with 123 participants used BBS as the outcome measure for balance 45,46,49,51.
The VR group had greater improvements with a moderate overall effect size. (smd:0.46, 95%
CI [-0.01, 0.93], I2=37%, P=0.06). However, the results were not statistically significant. A
forest plot is shown in figure 7.
Quality Of Life and participation
Eight trials with 686 participants measured Quality Of Life using various outcome measures.
8,25,27,41,43–45,50. A meta-analysis showed no significant difference between groups with (smd =
0.04 95%, CI[-0.11, 0.19], I2= 0%, P=0.79) . A forest plot is shown in figure 8.
Activities of daily life.
In nine trials 8,27,30,45,48,50,53–55 with 550 participants and several outcome measures. A meta-
analysis revealed a significant difference between the groups but the overall effect size was
low. However, the statistical heterogeneity was moderate. (smd = 0.25, 95% CI, [0.02 to 0.49],
I2=43.0%, p=0.04). A forest plot is shown in figure 9.
9Non-Immersive Virtual Reality Vs CT(Long term Effects).
Upper limb Function and Activity
Two trials, studied the long-term effects of VR on upper limb function using FM as the outcome
measure. A meta-analysis was not done due to high statistical heterogeneity in the data.
However, in 27 with a population of 64 participants, after 15 weeks follow up, greater
improvements were reported in the VR group but there was no significant difference between
the treatment groups. The overall effect size was small. (VR:40.4 ± 20.7, CT:34.5± 19.5,
smd=0.29, 95% CI[-0.20,0.78]). While in 54, with a population of 23 participants, after 1-month
follow-up, VR significantly improved with a large effect size (VR:5.3±1.1, CT=1.3±0.8,
smd=3.87, 95% CI[2.38,5.36]).
In two studies 53, 8 with 153 participants, upper limb activity was measured by BBT. After 2
months 53 and 4 weeks 8 follow up assessment, there were no significant differences between
the groups. (smd = -0.06 95% CI [-0.38, 0.26], I2= 0% P = 0.78).A forest plot is shown in figure
10.
Lower limb activity.
Only one trial 45 with a total of 47 participants reported long-term effects on lower limb activity.
Three months after intervention using TUG, greater improvements were reported in the VR
group. However, there was no significant inter-group difference (NIVR: -23.52±10.96, CT:-
28.67±18.73, smd = 0.34, 95% CI [-0.24, 0.92]).
Balance
In One trial 45 which used BBS as the outcome measure, a follow-up assessment conducted 3
months post-intervention with 137 participants reported no significant difference between the
two intervention groups. (VR: 46.31±5.8 , CT 45±5.06 smd= 0.23, 95% CI [-0.34 to 0.81]).
Quality Of Life and participation
Four trials 8,27,41,45 with 406 participants, conducted apost intervention follow-up on the quality
of life. Improvements were noted in both groups without significant intergroup difference
(smd=0.04, 95% CI[ -0.15 to 0.24], I2=0.0%, p= 0.67). A forest plot is shown in figure 11.
Activities of Daily Living
6 trials 8,27,30,41,45,53 with a total of 493 participants, reported a follow-up post-intervention. A
meta-analysis of results revealed no significant difference between the groups. (smd, = 0.00
95% CI [-0.22, 0.23],I2=28.0%, p= 0.97). A forest plot is shown in figure 12.
Adverse events.
Eight trials monitored adverse events 8,23,27,29,30,45,58,59. However, no serious adverse event
related to the treatments was reported.
10Discussion.
This work investigated the effectiveness of IVR and NIVR compared to conventional therapy
for stroke rehabilitation based on 22 included trials.
In general, the statistical analysis revealed that both VR interventions positively affected
patients' functionality in a comparable way to CT.
As a comparison of NIVR to CT, this meta-analysis discovered positive improvement in
treatments in favor of VR with small to medium effect sizes but with no significant difference
between the different techniques. Higher values of effect sizes in favor of the NIVR indicated
that patients had improvements in upper limb function and activity, mobility, balance, and
ADL. However, their level of independence, which is the aim of rehabilitation strategies did
not improve as their counterparts who received CT. The magnitude of this effect was
comparable to that observed in previous systematic reviews. They concluded that using VR-
based therapy systems enhanced upper limb function, quality of life 18,20, mobility, and
balance 21 in people with stroke but not significantly greater than CT. There is an indication
that VR may alleviate upper limb motor impairments and encourage motor activities and
societal participation among stroke survivors.
More improvements in VR could be due to several crucial factors. The first may be the ability
to provide therapists with various training programs. The therapist may select different
treatment modes and construct an individualized training program that adapts the intensity
and difficulty level of the training to the patient's current motor status 60. The potential of VR
to scale difficulty levels and give adequate rewards to users in the context of gaming and
level progression is vital to the implementation of effective VR training systems. Secondly,
VR systems incorporate task-specific workouts in addition to an appropriate level of exercise
intensity and repetition, from which patients can benefit. The majority of the included trials in
our review comprised graded training regimens to induce optimal neural plasticity and
continuous active engagement, both of which are essential for successful motor recovery after
a stroke 61.A recent review found that custom-built VR systems had a more significant effect
on the recovery of upper limb extremity function and activity than using CT 62 . Customized
VR systems are usually constructed based on a valid hypothesis to provide an effective
rehabilitation regimen beneficial to patients 19,61,63.Therefore, the ability to configure a VR
therapy system with multiple training alternatives may be critical for upper-limb
rehabilitation of motor deficits following stroke. Another reason could be the numerous types
of sensory feedback like visual and aural present in VR therapeutic systems, which make the
training more enjoyable. The use of virtual reality (VR) can assist in the creation of
environments in which more repeated actions are done in a playful context, hence enhancing
motivation and adherence to therapy. The majority of the selected studies have taken into
account this essential factor, either through participation scales or questionnaires assessing
the level of motivation.
By differentiating the effects obtained by immersive and non-immersive solutions, our
evidence suggests that IVR may be more beneficial than NIVR for upper limb function and
daily life activities. However, it is important to note that the results of IVR intervention are
based on short-term effects and few studies with a limited number of participants. We
observed that the effect size values of the results from studies that used IVR were higher than
NIVR.
A possible reason behind this phenomenon may be the missing depth cues in the 2D
environments that characterize NIVR applications 64.
Piggott et al. (2016) observed in their study that subjects using 2D VR systems such as cyber
gloves tend to decrease their wrist extension 65.This could be resolved by using a head-
mounted display (HMD). On the contrary, IVR systems take into account depth cues 17,which
11are responsible for accelerated cortical reorganization66, thus allowing the central nervous
system to control the position and orientation of body segments and adapt to the simulated
environment.
The effect of different neurological characteristics on VR rehabilitation outcomes also needs
examination. Some studies suggest that hemorrhagic stroke may result in more severe
cognitive, motor, and functional impairment than ischemic stroke 68,69. Future investigations
would benefit from a comparison of these stroke types to test the impact of both forms of VR.
The absence of adverse events related to the treatment suggests that NIVR can be considered
a safe treatment. This data is consistent with results from a review by Laver et al. 18, who
found little or no adverse events from VR treatment after stroke. This was because most
studies took place in settings that applied extra safety measures such as supervision or
walking harnesses in a laboratory or rehabilitation setting. It would also be important to note
that IVR studies did not monitor occurrence of adverse events among participants, therefore it
would important to examine the safety and psychological outcomes associated with the use of
head mounted displays.
Limitations.
The presented results should be interpreted considering some limitations. High heterogeneity
in the data made it difficult to perform a meta-analysis of results for some of the outcomes of
interest. For example, a meta-analysis on the beneficial effects of NIVR on upper limb
function using FM was not feasible.
There was a high diversity between the VR training scenarios, which made comparing the
results across the studies difficult. Therefore, we could not make a firm conclusion on the
benefits of this technology compared to CT, though all studies reported post-intervention
improvements.
The IVR studies were single-center designs characterized by high dropout rates mainly due to
medical reasons and compliance issues. 17 reported a high dropout rate in the CT group
(22.5%) and (23%) in the IVR group. Our results should be validated on additional works
based on larger populations.
Another limitation was the wide variety of outcome measures used in the included articles,
which precluded the possibility to compare different evidence across studies, as trials used
different versions of the same scale or different measuring units.
NIVR is already established and has many studies. On the contrary, the utilization of IVR
systems for motor rehabilitation programs is still in the early stages. IVR is a relatively new
technology and remains partially known, with a lot of the work limited to pain and phobias
treatment 13,67. There are few RCTs on the effectiveness of immersive virtual reality systems
in stroke rehabilitation. Furthermore, we did not find studies that examine the long-term
benefits of IVR, and therefore more trials are needed to validate the intensity of efficacy.
Additionally, most of the included trials had small sample sizes, which resulted in low
certainty in the effect measures and low statistical power. We recommend larger studies in
the future, with power calculations pointing to more than 25 participants per group.
12Conclusion
This study on the efficacy of virtual reality therapies applied to the rehabilitation of patients
with stroke highlights the benefits of VR. However, evidence of the clinical effectiveness of
the different forms of virtual reality (as either immersive or non-immersive) is scarce. Results
from this review suggest that IVR therapies may be more effective than NIVR but not CT to
improve upper limb activity, function, and daily life activities. The results of IVR
intervention are based on short-term effects with small effect sizes. Therefore, there is no
evidence that IVR treatment is long-lasting. NIVR provides the same benefits as CT for
mobility, balance, quality of life, and daily life activities among patients with stroke. While
the current literature evaluates VR as a viable alternative to conventional therapy in stroke
rehabilitation, much attention is accorded to non-immersive solutions due to their wide use in
clinical and research fields. By exploiting the increasing use and availability of IVR systems,
additional controlled trials with larger sample sizes should be carried out in the future to
reliably assess the long-term effects and promising benefits of this technology.
