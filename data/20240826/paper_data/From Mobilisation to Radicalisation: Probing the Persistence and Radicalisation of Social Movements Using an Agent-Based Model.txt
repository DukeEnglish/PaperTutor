Abstract
Wearelivinginanageofprotest.Althoughwehaveanexcellentunderstandingofthefactorsthatpredict
participation in protest, we understand little about the conditions that foster a sustained (versus transient)
movement. How do interactions between supporters and authorities combine to influence whether and how
people engage (i.e., using conventional or radical tactics)? This paper introduces a novel, theoretically-
founded and empirically-informed agent-based model (DIMESim) to address these questions. We model the
complex interactions between the psychological attributes of the protester (agents), the authority to whom
the protests are targeted, and the environment that allows protesters to coordinate with each other – over
time, and at a population scale. Where an authority is responsive and failure is contested, a modest sized
conventional movement endured. Where authorities repeatedly and incontrovertibly fail the movement, the
population disengaged from action but evidenced an ongoing commitment to radicalism (latent radicalism).
We are living in an age of protest [1], [2]. From the Arab Spring Revolutions in the Middle East and
NorthernAfrica,thetopplingoflongstandingdictatorshipsinSudanandAlgeria,theYellowVestsmovement
in France, pro-democracy movements in Chile, Venezuela, Thailand, Hong Kong, as well as the Black Lives
Matter and MeToo movements, such movements have played a critical role in countering authoritarian rule,
advancing the rights and freedoms of people across the world [3], [4]. Such behaviours are conceptualised
as collective action, that is, “efforts by large numbers of people, who define themselves and are defined
by others as a group, to solve collectively a problem that they feel they have in common, and which is
perceived to arise from their relations with other groups” [5]. We know much about why people engage
with such movements: hundreds of studies confirm that collective action emerges among people who are
morally convicted about their stance, feel the status quo is unjust, believe that by acting together they can
change the situation, and identify with groups that can mobilise action [6]–[9]
Yet, critical puzzles remain. First, we know relatively little about the conditions under which instances of
protest build into an enduring, sustained movement [10]. Participation in collective action is a goal-directed
behaviour [5] but social change takes time, implicating the repeated efforts of people over months, years,
and decades [11], [12]. Recent evidence suggests that the factors that shape incidental action may be distinct
from those factors that shape when people keep acting [13] and how they continue to engage [14]. This
paper addresses this critical gap, asking: what are the conditions that foster an enduring, sustained social
movement?
Tackling the temporal dimensions to such movements helps to address another puzzle. Social movements
typically display distinct balances of conventional and radical tactics tactics [3]. Conventional actions (e.g.,
petitioning, peaceful demonstrations, lobbying) are those that are common and approved of while radical
actions(e.g.,illegalactions,sabotage,civildisobedience)arethosethatareunusualandundesirablefromthe
perspective of authorities [14], [15]. Accordingly, a second goal of our analysis is to identify the conditions
under which radicalism may emerge as a preferred tactic as part of a longer-term struggle to achieve the
4202

goals of the movement (see also [8], [16]). We ask: What are the conditions under which people will come
to adopt more radical forms of action in pursuit of their movement’s goals?
Addressing these questions about the conditions for enduring action and the emergence of radicalism
requires a theoretical analysis of the effects of repeated cycles of protest [17]–[19]. We draw on the insights
of a current theoretical model of collective action outcomes, the Disidentification, Innovation, Moralisation,
Energisation model [14], [20], [21]. As we outline below, the DIME Model explains dis/engagement and
radicalism as a function of the interactions between members of a social movement and the responsiveness
versus intransigence of authorities to whom protesters appeal for change.
Methodologically, we require an approach that can capture the effects of time and scale (i.e., reflecting
the repeated interactions of a whole movement). Agent-based models (ABM) represent one solution [22],
[23]. ABMs are perhaps especially useful when it is implausible to test the effects of repeated interactions
over extended periods of time, involve population-level phenomena, difficult-to-access populations (e.g.,
activists, radicals), and/or ethically fraught contexts (e.g., repressive contexts where it may not be safe
to use alternative methods). Accordingly, we implemented and analysed the Disidentification Innovation
Moralisation Energisation Model of Collective Action Outcomes Simulation (DIMESim). DIMESim is
a theoretically-founded [14] and empirically-informed [20] agent-based model of collective action. Our
findings show that where an authority is responsive, and people individually and collectively contest failure,
a moderate conventionally engaged movement persists. Alternatively, where an authority repeatedly fails
the group, and the protesters are unable to individually or collectively re-frame failure as success, then the
movement population becomes inactive but radicalised.
MODELLING CYCLES OF PROTEST: FROM DIME THEORY TO DIME SIMULATION
Our approach differs from the established tradition of research into collective action [6]–[9] in focusing
on a population who have already engaged in action. One of the best predictors of future behaviour is past
behaviour [24], [25] and, indeed, the literature confirms that prior participation predicts future action [26],
[27]. However, there are clearly instances in which people will temporarily or permanently disengage, and
other instances where people will change tactics from conventional to radical actions (and vice versa; see
[8], [28], [29]). The Disidentification, Innovation, Moralisation and Energisation model of collective action
outcomes(DIMEModel;[14])presentsatheoreticalframeworkforhowinteractionsbetweenauthoritiesand
a movement shape ongoing dis/engagement, as well as tactics (conventional actions versus radical actions),
overtime.TheDIMEModelpositsthatwhenamovementisexperiencingsuccessinachievingitsgoals,that
success will reinforce tactical choices – notably, people that have previously adopted conventional tactics
will continue to do so.
On the other hand, the DIME Model posits that when a movement is struggling to achieve its aims,
diverging trajectories will emerge. One possible outcome is that, in the face of intransigence and failure,
people will disidentify (give up, walk away [30]). Thus, when a movement repeatedly experiences failure, it
isexpectedthatsomeadherentswilldisengageandbecomeinactive.Itisalsopossiblethatactorswilldecide
that, in the face of repeated failure, new forms of action are necessary (Innovation). For those who had taken
prior conventional action, this would mean adopting new radical methods (see [28]). Conversely, for those
who had previously adopted radicalism, innovation represents a shift back to more conventional (accepted)
forms of action (see [31]). Finally, another possibility is that supporters will see the struggle as of increased
moral worth ( [32], [33]; i.e., Moralisation) and pursue their previous forms of action with renewed vigour
and energy (Energisation). In this way, the success and failure of prior tactics (i.e., conventional action
versus more radical forms of action) shapes subsequent tactics. People may give up on immediate action
(disengage), double down on conventional actions or increase support for more radical action [14], [16].3
Indeed, experimental tests of the DIME propositions showed that each of these outcomes occurs [20],
though for different sub-groups of people [21]. Louis and colleagues [20] report a meta-analysis of nine
experiments (N = 1663) across different movements (environment, pro/anti-immigration, pro/anti-abortion,
marriage equality). Participants were exposed to the ostensible success or failure of their movement, in a
context where they were asked to imagine that they had engaged in either conventional or radical tactics.
The tests revealed that people who are experiencing failure are more likely to disidentify, especially if they
have been acting radically; that people who are experiencing the failure of their conventional tactics are
more likely to innovate; and that people who are experiencing failure are more likely to endorse radical
tactics, as are those who have been more radical in the past. What is not known is how these effects iterate
over time, where protesters may experience a win one day, and a setback the next. An as-yet untested insight
of DIME is that failure will produce diverging trajectories in the movement population overall.
It is also the case that success and failure must be interpreted, and people differ in their perceptions
of what constitutes failure and success [34]. For some, failure may be contested and re-framed as success
[13], [35]: “our action did not effect policy change but we built an oppositional movement”. This cognitive,
individual re-framing tends to occur among people who are more strongly committed to the cause, i.e.,
people high in identification or psychological commitment to the group [34]. Members of social movements
are also influenced by fellow supporters’ views about the progress of the movement [36], allowing for
group members to socially, collectively re-frame failure in ways that promote continued engagement with
the movement [37], [38]: “we agree that although we did not effect change, we stood up for our values”.
As noted above, ABMs are well suited to modelling emergent properties of complex systems involving
interactions between individuals (protesters), external factors (i.e., authorities who signal success and failure)
and social networks (fellow protesters), over time [22], [23], [39], [40]. There is an established literature
where ABMs are used to study emergent collective behaviours, dating back to the work of Granovetter [41].
Indeed, ABMs have been used to study revolution [42], [43] and the emergence of mass collective action
with [44]–[46] or without [41], [47] an authority that suppresses active agents. Existing models have been
developed utilising economic principles [42], [48] or social influence processes inspired by mathematical
epidemiology [49], [50], game theory [51], [52], and cascade/threshold behaviour [41], [44]–[47]. DIMESim
departs from these prior approaches by modelling an agent’s evolving psychological states based on the
insights of psychological science [14], [20]. We also progress this literature beyond binary distinctions of
dis/engagement to include (conventional, radical) tactics, reflecting the diversity of real world movements.
Bringing together these methodological and theoretical advancements, we developed a theoretically in-
formed, empirically evidenced agent-based model (DIMESim) to simulate effects of interactions between
protesters, authorities, and supporters over time and at scale. As we show below, incorporating these features
into a computational model allows for the emergence of complex collective phenomena in ways that would
elude traditional research methodologies (interviews, surveys, experiments) but provide powerful tests of
propositions about the conditions for an enduring movement and emergent radicalism [53].
THE DIMESIM MODEL
TheDIMESimagent-basedmodelisrepresentedinFig.1.Thecompletemathematicaldetailsarepresented
in Methods and Materials. Agent-based models have three components: the agents, the environment, and the
interactions, which we describe in turn. DIMESim contains a population of n ≥ 2 agents each representing
an individual protester, indexed as agent i = 1,2,...,n. The agents comprise the mobilisation potential of
a movement [54], where motivational and structural factors influence who acts, how they do so, and when.
The dynamics play out over a sequence of discrete time steps t = 0,1,2,....4

Fig. 1: Schematic overview of four phases of the DIMESim model. First, an Authority broadcasts to
all agents a common success or failure signal relating to their demands (1). The signal is received by each
agent who can (2) individually re-frame the signal from failure to success (e.g. shown by Bill and Cissy),
and, in a third step, (3) collectively re-frame based on the success/failure interpretations of neighbours in the
social network. Finally (4), based on the perceived signal and the agent’s DIME variable states, the agent
will make a decision about whether to act (active or latent), in either a conventional, innovating, or radical
direction. In the schematic example, all agents have received a failure signal (red arrow). Abby interprets
the failure signal as a failure and does not individually or collectively re-frame that failure as success (red
exclamation). Bill collectively re-frames failure as success (green tick). Cissy individually re-frames failure
to perceive the outcome as a success (green tick).

each social change attempt by sending out a signal that the protest event has succeeded or failed. Interactions
between the protesters and authorities, and within the movement, are modelled in a sequence of three
processes.
The first process involves the authority sending out a common signal to each agent: at every time step,
the probability of a failure signal and success signal is p ∈ [0,1] and 1−p, respectively – that is, higher
p represents more failure signals. This is akin to the authority using state-controlled or mass media media
to broadcast the outcome. In highly repressive regimes, there is no further contestation [55], [56]. Yet,
we know that what is seen to be a success and a failure are subjective and people can contest whether
a given outcome is a success or failure both individually [21], [34], [35] and collectively through social5
interaction with fellow protesters (see [36], [38], [57]). Incorporating these important aspects allows for a
more ecologically valid test of these outcomes than does assuming that people and movements passively
accept the signals of authorities. These two observations are captured by the second and third processes,
respectively.
In the second process, individual contestation occurs, whereby each agent has a probability to contest a
failure signal from the authority and re-frame it as a success. Following [34], [37], [58] this is especially
likely to be the case for highly identified members. In DIMESim, the probability of re-framing increases as
thelevelofdisidentificationdecreases(asD (t)decreases)andasathresholdparameterF ∈ [0,1]decreases.
i
Thus, decreasing F captures a protester that more easily re-frames because it reflects a lower threshold for
re-framing.
The third process captures collective re-framing. After agents individually contest the failure signal, they
then share their perception of whether or not the protest was successful with other agents. In DIMESim,
the sharing occurs in a fixed network structure, analogous to a social media network. If agent i believes the
protest has failed at the start of the collective re-framing process, they can become convinced of its success
when a threshold fraction ϕ ∈ [0,1] of their network neighbours believe the protest is successful. An integer
parameter R ≥ 1 captures how long this collective process goes on for; the larger is R, the more agents
are able to freely communicate success and failure signals with each other. The re-framing processes do not
occur when the authority sends out a success signal; i.e. all agents will perceive the signal as success.
The next step of the model involves each agent internalising the perceived outcome of the protest – that
is, the perceived signal resulting from the sequence of the authority signal, the individual re-framing and
the collective re-framing. First, agent i updates its DIME variables, taking into account i) agent i’s belief in
the failure or success of the protest movement and ii) the agent’s current action x (t), with the coefficients
i
of the equations derived from the empirical data in [20].
Finally, in the fourth step, an agent will decide on its next action, x (t+1). This comprises two aspects:
i
their decision to act and choice of tactics. An agent’s engagement depends on whether they are sufficiently
identified with the cause [6], [7]. Namely, agent i will chose not to protest if D (t+1) is greater than the
i
average of I (t+1), M (t+1) and E (t+1). Otherwise, agent i will protest at time t+1. An agent’s
i i i
tactical choice is either conventional or radical, and depends on their last active protest tactic, and whether
they wish to innovate at the current time step.
This sequence of events (see Fig. 1), from authority signal to agent updating of their DIME variables and
action, occurs in a single time step. The computational model then plays out over a sequence of time steps
t = 0,1,2,.... The primary parameters of the model are summarised in Table I.
TABLE I: The four primary parameters in DIMESim. The results interrogate outcomes of the model over
the space of these parameters.

An importantfeature ofDIMESim is thatan agentcan choose notto protestbut still havean orientationin6
termsofwhichtactictheagentwouldadoptiftheyweretoprotest.Recentmodelsdistinguishbetweenlatent
(e.g., attitudinal) and active (e.g., behavioural) support for a movement [29]. Populations can appear inactive
(disengaged) [18], [54] but will re-engage when the social and psychological conditions are right, because
actors did not attitudinally disengage. It is also the case here that agents can exist in a state of innovation,
alternating their choices of actions between radical and conventional (consistent with evidence presented
in [31], [59]–[61]. Agent i will innovate if agent i’s innovation exceeds the average of their moralisation
and energisation. If agent i innovates, they will change their action relative to the action they took when
last active, i.e. from conventional to radical, or from radical to conventional.
Bringing together combinations about the decision to act/not (latent or active); choice of tactics (con-
ventional, radical, innovative) yields a typology of different types of protesters (see Table II). Agents are
denoted as latent radical or latent conventional if they are inactive, are not innovating, and are orientated
towards radical or conventional tactics, respectively. Agents are latent innovators if they are inactive and
innovating (and thus alternating between radical and conventional tactics). Similarly, an agent is an active
radical, active conventional or active innovator if they are active, and adopting radical, conventional or
innovative tactics, respectively.

algorithmic classification using model variables.

RESULTS
Our simulations involve modelling the effects of interactions with authorities (p; probability of failure
signals), at increasing levels of individual (F; threshold parameter) and collective re-framing (ϕ; threshold
parameter), and varying lengths of free communication (R); see Table I) Given the complexity in the design,
we first present results under two different idealised scenarios that reflect combinations of authority signals,
individual and collective re-framing, over time. We then examine more systematically the effects of (degrees
of) success/failure and individual re-framing whilst holding collective re-framing steady. Finally, we probe
the effects of collective re-framing at different levels of ϕ and R.
Full details of the simulation parameters are provided in the Methods and Materials. Here, we briefly
summarise the key aspects that are uniform across the simulations. We initialise all agents to be active and
protesting conventionally, x (0) = 1 for all i = 1,2,...,n, while D (0), I (0), M (0), and E (0) are drawn
i i i i i
from distributions estimated from empirical data. Due to the stochastic nature of the model, we conducted
20 Monte Carlo simulations out to T = 10,000 time steps and compute average outcomes across the 20
replicates. The agents interact over a synthetic network constructed using the Holme-Kim algorithm [62],
which generates networks with the properties of real-world social networks. Unless noted otherwise, we
fixed R = 10, allowing agents to communicate success or failure signals with each other for a substantial
period during the collective re-framing phase, prior to the next authority signal.7

we see a diverse range of protester types, with latent conventional (LaCo), active innovators (AcIn), and
active conventional (AcCo) being most prevalent. In (e), the population is comprised almost entirely of latent
radical protesters, i.e. they are inactive but orientated to radical tactics if they were to become active.
Emergent outcomes of two idealised scenarios
Figure 2 displays the outcomes under two idealised scenarios. The first, shown in the left panels of the
figure(Fig. 2(a), (c) and (d)), is where the authority is responsive p = 0.2 (high probability of success
signals), agents have a high chance of individually re-framing a failure signal to a success signal F = 0.2,
and an agent is easily influenced by the success signals of their neighbours in the collective re-framing
stage ϕ = 0.2. The second, shown in the right panels of the figure, (Fig 2(b), (e) and (f)) corresponds to a
scenario of an intransigent authority (high probability of failure signals) with p = 0.8, agents have a low
chance of re-framing failure as success, F = 0.8, and are not easily influenced by the success signals of
group members in the collective re-framing stage, ϕ = 0.8. In panels (a) and (b), we show a small n = 50

network to highlight the topological features of the model under each scenario, while time-series obtained
in panels (c), (d), (e) and (f) shows the aggregated simulation results for a larger n = 1000 network; both
display the evolution of effects over time (i.e., between timestep 1−10,000).
Fig. 2 reveals two very different emergent phenomena. The outcomes in the responsive authority scenario
(Fig. 2: panels (a), (c) and (d)) reveal a trajectory of sustained tional engagement. FroPanel (c) suggests
that as t → T (i.e. at steady state), three types of protesters are most prevalent in the population: 48%
latent conventional (sympathisers in Klandermans’ terms [63]), 31% active innovators, and 14% active
conventional. In other words, virtually all inactive agents favour conventional tactics, while those that are
actively protesting are either innovators, or conventional protesters. Panel (d) shows the average values of
the DIME variables in the population. On average, agents are highly identified with the protest movement
(low disidentification), have low-moderate levels of innovation, and low moralisation and low energy. This
scenario resembles the sustained and emergent collective action that is often predicted in existing agent-
based models [41], [44], [46], but our model is unique in explaining these outcomes as a function of the
psychological state of agents and their interactions with the authority.
In contrast, the intransigent authority scenario (Fig. 2: panels (b), (e) and (f)) shows very different
emergent phenomena under conditions of high failure, and low individual and collective re-framing. Here,
the simulation revealed the emergence of mass latent radicalism, whereby the overwhelming majority of the
population (79%) have become inactive radicals – agents who are inactive but orientated towards radical
protest actions if triggered (see Table 1). A small proportion (14%) of agents continue to act conventionally.
Fig. 2(f) shows that agents are on average highly disidentified with the protest movement, highly moralised,
have moderate energisation, and low innovation.
Interactions between the authority and individual re-framing
We next systematically interrogated the probability of failure signal p ∈ [0,1] and threshold for individual
re-framing F ∈ [0,1], on the distribution of agent types (see Table II), holding collective re-framing constant
at ϕ = 0.8 and R = 10. Fig. 3 presents the average population fraction for each agent at steady state. The
different colours in Fig. 3 correspond to choice of tactics (conventional, innovating, or radical); the top panel
(Fig. 3(a)-(c)) denotes active strategies whilst the bottom panel (Fig. 3(d)-(f)) denotes latent strategies. Plots
of DIME variables of the population for each protester type are available in the Supplementary Materials.
Fig. 4 complements Fig. 3 to present an overview of the dominant type of protester at each combination of
p and F (Fig 4(a)) and also as a function of the population fraction (Fig. 4(b)).
Fig. 3 shows that active radical agents (Fig. 3(c)) and latent innovators (Fig. 3(e)), occupy a consistently
marginal presence at all levels of the simulation, never exceeding 4% of the population. On the other hand,
when failure p and F are both high (e.g. p ≥ 0.55 and F ≥ 0.55, denoting low re-framing), latent radical
agents comprise over 60% of the population, and up to 87% (Fig. 3(f), Fig. 4(a)) – the most prevalent
majority response for any of the simulations (denoted by the green bars in Fig. 4(b)). The results in Fig. 3(f)
suggest that latent radicalism does not emerge due to a single factor, but is an outcome of multiple factors.
Even when failure signals are high, if there is capacity to individually (cognitively) re-frame and perceive
that failure as success (i.e., F is low), then latent radicalism will not emerge. Similarly, when the protesters
lack capacity to re-frame (high F), but the authority is responsive (low p) then latent radicalism will emerge
amongst only a small proportion of the population.
Indeed, when p and F are medium-to-low in value, the population is far more heterogeneous (Fig. 4(b),
consistent with [21]) and three types of agents are typically observed: active conventional (Fig. 3(a)), active
innovators (Fig. 3(b)), and latent conventional (Fig. 3(d)). When p and F are both low (≤ 0.15), latent
conventional agents are the majority (Fig. 4), forming 44% on average and up to 48% of the population.a) Actaiv) eA Cctoiavne)v AeCcnottinivovene aCnltoionnvaelntional b) Actbiv) eA Icntinbvoe) v AIanctnotiorvsvea Itnonrsovators c) Actciv) eA Rctaivcde)i c ARacaltidviec aRladical

simulations at a given (p,F) location (n = 1000): active conventional (a), active innovators (b), active
radical (c), latent conventional (d), latent innovators (e) and latent radicals (f). Collective re-framing is held
constant across plots (ϕ = 0.8,R = 10). The red square marker indicates the intransigent authority context
studied in the right panels of Fig. 2 (p = 0.8,F = 0.8,ϕ = 0.8,R = 10). Contours show an interaction
between probability of failure signals (p) and threshold for individual re-framing (F).
These results suggest that a population of sympathetic but largely inactive actors emerges from situations
wherethemovementisactuallyandunderstoodtobe(re-framedas)succeeding(Fig.3(d)).Ontheotherhand,

except for at high levels of failure and low re-framing (see Fig. 4). Indeed, even a relatively low proportion
of failure signals from an authority (F ≥ 0.15) will be associated with innovation, if there are constraints
on the ability of protesters to individually re-frame failure as success (i.e., as F increases; Fig. 3(b)). By
contrast, active conventional protesters were prevalent across nearly all levels of the simulations (37% on
average) but never exceeded 39% of the total population (Fig. 3(a)). Active conventional protesters were
not the majority or dominant response within the population (Fig. 4) but were most prevalent at moderate
levels of failure and re-framing (Fig. 3(a)).

Fig. 4: Dominant types of agent under varying probability of failure signals (p) and threshold for
individual re-framing (F). (a): Variation in dominant action, utilising colour and hatching (see Key) for the
six agent types, with n = 1000 and varying probability of failure signals (p) and threshold for individual re-
framing (F) over [0,1] (holding collective re-framing at ϕ = 0.8 and R = 10). (b): Population composition
(on z-axis) for the corresponding dominant strategy at each parameter pair. The latent radical dominant
region shows the highest population fraction of dominant action of any regime.
The role of collective contestation: re-framing and interaction
Finally, we explored the influence of the collective re-framing process which is shaped by two factors:
threshold parameter ϕ ∈ [0,1] and length of free communication R ≥ 1. Fig. 5 shows the population fraction
of the dominant action for each probability of failure signal—threshold for individual re-framing pair (p,F).
From the left to right columns, ϕ decreases; i.e. the threshold for collective re-framing in terms of the
proportion of fellow supporters who believe that the action has been successful. From the bottom to top
rows, R increases; i.e. the length of time that agents can freely communicate signals to other agents between
cycles. Contour plots of different agent types and the DIME variables are available in the Supplementary
Materials.
As ϕ increases (from left to right columns), latent radicalism begins emerging under a larger space of
conditions. For example, for p = 0.85 (failure is high), F = 0.45 (moderate individual re-framing) and
R = 1 (short communication; i.e., bottom row, Fig. 5(g)- 5(i)), there is low latent radicalism when collective
re-framing is high (ϕ = 0.2) (Fig. 5(g)), but high latent radicalism when collective re-framing is low ϕ = 0.8
(Fig. 5(i)). As R increases, the space of emerging latent radicalism shrinks (as seen by the diminishing green
area as we move up the rows of Fig. 5) since there is more time and capacity for people to interact with
otheragents.However,theimpactofR isweakercomparedtothatofϕ,andR hasminimaleffectswhenthe
threshold for collective re-framing is low (low ϕ) – it does not matter if fewer protesters are encountered, if
thosethatareencounteredprimarilyseethefailureasasuccess.Indeed,increasingRbeyond10hasminimal
effect (see Supplementary Materials). Therefore, latent radicalism emerges especially when it requires many
supporters to convince a protester to re-frame failure as success (high ϕ) and there are limited opportunities
to contest it collectively (low R).
Active innovation and latent conventionalism are the only other emergent scenarios (Fig. 5), with com-

Fig. 5: The role of collective re-framing in the emergence of dominant protest types. Each panel depicts
the population composition of the dominant action in the steady state, for a given probability of failure
signal—threshold for individual re-framing pair (p,F) (n = 1000). Rows and columns show the outcome
when varying: (left to right) the threshold for collective re-framing (ϕ ∈ {0.2,0.5,0.8}); and (bottom to top)
the length of free communication (R ∈ {1,2,10}). Colouring follows the key given, covering the six agent
types under study. Overall, we can see the largely resilient nature of the dominant latent radical region,
under variation in collective re-framing.
paratively weaker dominance (i.e., the peaks of the teal and blue are much lower than that of the green).
The prevalence of active innovator agents grows with ϕ and shrinks with R, with the opposite behaviour
occurring for the space of latent conventionalism. We conclude by noting that these results are robust to
different initial conditions (see Supplementary Materials).

DISCUSSION
Protestisahighlyconsequentialbutcomplexformofbehaviour,shapedbycyclesofinteractions[18],[19]
acrossmultiplelevelsofanalysis[9],[64].Thesecomplexitiesposekeychallengesfortheempiricalstudyof
collective action and social change [65]. The present research integrates the insights of social psychological
models of collective action [14], [20] with agent-based modelling to address these gaps, examining cycles
of interactions within and between protesters and authorities. We explore how complex interactions at lower
levels (e.g., within and between protesters, authorities) can shape emergent behaviours at the population or
movement level in ways that may not be well anticipated in the current literature [66].
Our data revealed starkly different emergent outcomes at the two idealised extremes. On the one hand, the
modelsrevealedthatwheretheauthoritiesareresponsive(lowlevelsoffailure)andwherepeopleindividually
(cognitively) and collectively (socially) contest failure, the population was largely conventionally engaged
(latent and actively). Stable, sustained low-moderate levels of protest and innovation in partnership with a
statewhichisquicktoamendgrievances,suggesttheparadigmcanmodelawell-functioningdemocracy[67].
On the other hand, in contexts with unresponsive governments (high failure), where such failure is
incontrovertible and/or people cannot contest the outcome collectively (e.g., due to repression), protesters
generally become inactive but radicalised. It is our contention that widespread latent radicalism – when the
tinder is dry, awaiting a spark – holds the key to understanding how mass protest can emerge seemingly
spontaneously (e.g., in Tahrir square). In other words, repressive conditions give rise to the febrile precursor
state to widespread revolutionary action [56]. In future extensions of DIMESim, triggering factors such
as incidents of pubic injustice and repression [68], disseminated and broadcast allowing for collective re-
framing [69] and possibility of resistance, may be included. Such events could create a sudden surge of
commitment (identification), which in the present model would shift actors from inaction to sudden mass
action [70].
There is also a clear distinction between the two emergent outcomes in terms of the composition, or
heterogeneity, of the movement overall. Where there is a conventional movement, there is a broad mixture
of different protester tactics as well as moderate levels of passive (latent) support and overt action. On the
other hand, whenever latent radicalism emerges, it occurs in most of the population.
The model also allows us to examine nonlinear interactions between variables across multiple levels of
analysis. Here, the data offer many points of engagement but, for instance, we find that even when the
authority consistently signals failure, a population that is sufficiently able to contest failure will continue
to act, resulting in a primarily conventionally engaged movement. Repeated movement failure, especially
when it sits alongside repression of thought and interaction, is a path to mass latent radicalisation – but the
reverse is also true: conventional action dominates where the movements are actually and/or understood to
be, succeeding in some measure [34]. The psychological “contract” between participants in a movement and
authority substantially buffers latent and overt radicalisation (see [58], [71]).
Contemporary theorising of the multi-level nature of collective action identifies myriad other factors that
could be incorporated into future models [9], [64], [65]. Our model was initialised based on a population of
peoplewhohadalreadyengagedinconventionalaction(followingDIME;[14]).Futuremodelscouldtheorise
and test the mobilisation of those who are yet to act. We also did not model effects in the context of counter-
mobilisation where another social movement emerges to oppose the desired change; such interactions would

represented by a single actor who signals a binary success or failure. Future research could simulate effects
with more realism – e.g., authorities could be modelled adapting their signals in response to the protesters
actions[72].Ouranalysisshowsthatagent-basedmodelsarewell-equippedtointegratetheoretical,empirical
and meta-theoretical insights into a common framework.13
For decades, scholars have highlighted the importance of avoiding reductionist readings of how people
relate to their social world, and seek to change it turn [15], [70]. People are influenced by and influences
on the worlds of which they are a part. The computational approach advanced here provides a promising
additional apparatus in the toolkit.14

Mathematical Details of DIMESim Model
TheDIMESimmodelisanagent-basedmodel,consistingofapopulationofn ≥ 2agents,whichweindex
asagenti = 1,2,3,...,n.Eachagentrepresentsanindividualwhoisalignedwithacommonmovement,and
the model unfolds over discrete time-steps t = 0,1,2,.... At each time step, the model can be broken down
into three sequential processes: authority signal and (individual + collective) re-framing, DIME evolution,
and updating of actions. We provide details of these in turn, but before doing so, we list the key variables
associated with each agent.
1) Disidentification, D (t) ∈ [0,100], indicates how disidentified the agent is with the movement.
i
2) Innovation, I (t) ∈ [0,100], indicates how willing an agent is to change their action type.
i
3) Moralisation, M (t) ∈ [0,100], indicates how moralised the agent is with respect to supporting the
i
movement.
4) Energisation, E (t) ∈ [0,100], indicates how energised the agent is to support the movement.
i
5) Perceived signal B (t) ∈ {−1,1}, is whether the agent perceives the protest movement to have
i
succeeded (−1) or failed (1) at time t.
6) Tactical orientation xc(t) ∈ {−1,1}, determines whether the agent is oriented towards radical (−1) or
i
conventional (1) protest tactics.
7) Action x (t) ∈ {−1,0,1}, represents whether the agent is actively participating in the protest using
i
radical tactics (−1) or conventional tactics (1), or inactive (0).
8) Last active action xh(t) ∈ {−1,1} represents whether the most recent action (before time t) taken by
i
agent i was radical (−1) or conventional (1) action.
The full list of variables and parameters are available in Tables III and IV. Note that D = 0 and D =
i i
100 correspond to the agent being fully identified and fully disidentified with the movement, respectively.
Similarly, M = 0 and M = 100 represent agent i being completely demoralised and completely moralised
i i
with respect to supporting the movement, respectively, while E = 0 and E = 100 correspond to an
i i
agent i being entirely without energy and completely energised to support the movement, respectively. The
innovation term I refers to how willing an agent is to change their action type (more details on this in the
i
sequel).
Authoritysignalandre-framing: Ateverynewtime-stept+1,theauthoritybroadcastsasignalU(t+1) ∈
{−1,1} to all agents, according to the following equation:

1, with probability p
U(t+1) = , (1)
−1, with probability 1−p
where U(t+1) = −1 and U(t+1) = 1 is a signal of ‘success’ and ‘failure’, respectively, and p ∈ [0,1] is
the probability of the authority signalling ‘failure’.
If the authority signal is ‘success’, all agents accept it. But if it is ‘failure’, then each agent contests the
signal, re-framing it as BIR(t+1) ∈ {−1,1} according to the following equation:
i

[100−D (t)]Z (t)
−1, if U(t+1) = −1 or i i > F
BIR(t+1) = 100 (2)
i
1, otherwise
where, D (t) ∈ [0,100] is the disidentification level of the agent, F ∈ [0,1] is a threshold parameter,
i
and Z (t) ∈ [0,1] is a random number that is at every time step t and for each agent sampled from a
i
uniform distribution on the interval [0,1]. We have assumed the threshold F to be homogeneous among
the agents, although individual values can be chosen if the population is strongly heterogeneous. Therefore,18
agent i’s probability of re-framing failure to success (when U(t + 1) = 1) increases as disidentification,
D (t), decreases, and as the parameter F decreases.
i
If the agent still perceives the signal as ‘failure’ after individual re-framing (IR), then R ≥ 1 rounds of
collective re-framing (CR) happen, after which the final perceived signal B (t+1) ∈ {−1,1} is given by
i
the following equation:
B (t+1) := QR(t+1) (3)
i i
where Qj(t+1) ∈ {−1,1} denotes the signal perceived by agent i after the jth CR round.
i
The quantity QR(t + 1) is defined recursively as follows. We define Q0(t + 1) := BIR(t + 1). Now,
i i i
supposing that Qj(t+1) has been defined for some integer 0 ≤ j < R, we define
i

−1, Sj(t+1) > ϕ
Qj+1(t+1) := i (4)
i Qj(t+1),
otherwise
i
where Sj(t+1) ∈ [0,1] is defined in Eq. (5) below. In particular, Sj(t+1) denotes the proportion of the
i i
neighbours of agent i who perceive the authority signal as ‘success’ at the jth CR round of time-step t+1,
and ϕ ∈ [0,1] is a threshold parameter. We assume that threshold ϕ is homogeneous among the agents.
We represent connections between agents using an undirected unweighted graph G = (V,E) with node
set V = {1,2,...,n} and edge set E ⊆ V ×V. Each node i ∈ V denotes an agent, and an undirected edge
(i,j) ∈ E connects agent i to agent j if the two agents ‘interact’ with one another. Here, an interaction
j
means the ability for the two agents to share their Q values, i.e., to discuss their perceptions of the authority
i
signal. Note that we assume an agent does not interact with themselves, i.e., (i,i) ∈/ E for all i ∈ V. The
neighbourhood of agent i, denoted by N , is defined to be the set N := {j ∈ V : (i,j) ∈ E}, and agent
i i
j is said to be a neighbour of agent i if and only if j ∈ N . The proportion of neighbours of agent i who
i
perceive the authority signal as success at the jth stage of CR,
Sj(t+1),
is thus defined as,
i

 1 (cid:80) 1−Qj(t+1), N ̸= ∅
Sj(t+1) = 2|N i| k∈N i k i (5)
i
0, N
i
= ∅
where |·| denotes set cardinality. Note that in the case where agent i has no neighbours, Eq. (3) assigns
BIR(t+1) to the final perceived signal value B (t+1) since 0 ̸> ϕ for any ϕ ∈ [0,1].
i i
We note that when U(t + 1) = −1, then the sequence of individual and collective re-framing, viz.
Eq. (2) through Eq. (5), always result in B (t+1) = −1 for all agents; i.e. when the authority signal is
i
success, the perceived signal byall agents is always success. Moreover, re-framing only allows conversionof
failure signals to success, so that if BIR(t+1) = −1 (agent i successfully re-frames failure to success at the
i
individualre-framingstage),thenthecollectivere-framingstagecannotchangethisoutcome:Qj(t+1) = −1
i
for all j = 0,1,...,R.
DIME evolution: At the end of the collective re-framing stage, each agent has their own understanding
of whether the protest movement was successful at time t+1, viz. B (t+1). The DIME theoretical model
i
proposes a framework for how a protester’s internal psychological (DIME) states respond to the success or
failure of a movement. Incorporating the full meta-analysis results [20, Table 2], each agent i updates their
DIME states according to the following four regression equations:
D (t+1) = P (cid:0) D (t)+β B (t+1)+λ xc(t)+γ B (t+1)xc(t)+ωD(t)(cid:1) , (6a)
i i D i D i D i i i
I (t+1) = P (cid:0) I (t)+β B (t+1)+λ xc(t)+γ B (t+1)xc(t)+ωI(t)(cid:1) , (6b)
i i I i I i I i i i
M (t+1) = P (cid:0) M (t)+β B (t+1)+λ xc(t)+γ B (t+1)xc(t)+ωM(t)(cid:1) , (6c)
i i M i M i M i i i
E (t+1) = P (cid:0) E (t)+β B (t+1)+λ xc(t)+γ B (t+1)xc(t)+ωE(t)(cid:1) . (6d)
i i E i E i E i i i19
Here, β , β , β , β are the aggregate partial correlations adapted from the first column (Protest Outcome)
D I M E
of [20, Table 2], and they describe the gradient or velocity of change in the DIME states based on the
(perceived) protest outcome B (t+1). The λ and γ values are adapted from the coefficients in the second
i
and third columns of [20, Table 2], that describe the gradient based on the orientation of the agent, xc(t) ∈
i
{−1,1}, and the product B (t + 1)xc(t), respectively. The terms ω (t) are random noise with uniform
i i i
distribution over the unit interval [0,1]. We impose a saturation so that the four DIME states cannot be
greater than 100 or less than 0 via P : R → [0,100],x (cid:55)→ P(x) defined as,

0, x < 0


P(x) = x, 0 ≤ x ≤ 100 (7)


100, x > 100
Decision to act and how to act: After updating their internal psychological state, each agent decides
whether they want to take action in the current time step, A (t+1) ∈ {0,1}, and whether they want to stick
i
with their previous orientation (conventional or radical) or innovate to the alternative, C (t+1) ∈ {−1,1},
i
according to the following equation:

I (t+1)+M (t+1)+E (t+1)
0, if D (t+1) > i i i
A (t+1) = i 3 (8a)
i
1 otherwise

M (t+1)+E (t+1)
−1, if I (t+1) > i i
C (t+1) = i 2 (8b)
i
1 otherwise
where A (t+1) = 0 and A (t+1) = 1 refer to the agent being latent (inactive) and active, respectively, and
i i
C (t+1) = −1 and C (t+1) = 1 refer to the agent innovating and sticking with their previous orientation,
i i
respectively
The orientation xc(t) ∈ {−1,1} and action x (t) ∈ {−1,0,1} that each agent takes is then calculated as:
i i
xc(t+1) = C (t+1)xh(t+1) (9a)
i i i
x (t+1) = A (t+1)xc(t+1), (9b)
i i i
where xc(t) = −1 and 1 indicate the agent is oriented towards radical tactics and conventional tactics
i
respectively. Then, x (t) = −1,0 and 1 indicate that the agent is taking radical action, no action, and
i
conventional action respectively.
Note that xh(t) ∈ {−1,1} is the last active action of agent i, and not the orientation. I.e., the most recent
i
conventional or radical action taken by agent i before the current time-step. Define xh(0) := 1 (conventional
i
action). Now, supposing inductively that xh(t) has been defined for t ≥ 0, we define
i

x (t), if x (t) ̸= 0
xh(t+1) := i i (10)
i
xh(t), otherwise
i
The determination of the variables x (t+1) and xc(t+1) is the final event for the new time step t+1,
i i
determining whether the agent is active (and what tactics the agent is oriented towards). The next iteration
then begins with the authority signalling success/failure, as described above in Eq. (1).

T ≥1 Number of total time-steps in the simulation
For each setting of model parameters (p,F,ϕ,R), we performed 20 independent runs of our simulations
with 1000 agents (n = 1,000) to 10,000 time steps (T = 10,000). For initial conditions, we assumed all
agents began as active, with conventional tactics: A (0) = 1,C (0) = 1,xh(0) = 1 ∀ i = 1,2,...,n. The
i i i
initial DIME variables (D (0), I (0), M (0), and E (0)) and the gradients (β, λ, and γ) were sampled from
i i i i
normal distributions with means and standard deviations taken from [20], as shown in Table V.
Each data point in the timeseries plots is calculated as the rolling average of the corresponding property
over the previous 20 time steps and over the independent runs. Each data point in the heatmap, contour,
and bar charts is calculated as the temporal average of the last 500 time steps in the simulation and
over the independent runs. For actions, the values represent the percentage of the population that holds
the corresponding characteristic. For DIME, the values represent the average value among all agents. To
determine the population proportions for the different action types when reporting results, the Table VI is21

1) Generate the network graph G using the Holme-Kim algorithm.
2) Sample the stochastic parameters (β,λ,γ) using the distribution parameters given in Table V
3) Set the initial value (t = 0) for all variables
a) Set A (0) = 1,C (0) = 1,xh(0) = 1 ∀ i = 1,2,...,n
i i i
b) D (0),I (0),M (0),E (0) are sampled using the distribution parameters given in Table V, and
i i i i
applying the saturation function, Eq. (7), to ensure all values lie in [0,100]
c) All other variables are set the default initial value (0), as they are either not referenced in the
simulation or are overwritten with a calculation before their first reference
4) Run through time-steps t = 1,2,...,T. At each time step, run through Eq. (1) – Eq. (10).22

I. SENSITIVITY OF DIME VALUES TO p AND F
In the main text, we presented and discussed in Fig. 3 and 4 the sensitivity of the long-run steady state
population fraction of the six individual agent types as well as the dominant agent type, that emerge from
our simulations when varying parameters p and F while keeping parameters ϕ = 0.8 and R = 10 constant.

Fig. S1: Sensitivity of the long-run steady state average DIME values among agents when varying p and F
for constant ϕ = 0.8 and R = 10.
We observethat disidentificationand moralisationvary fromvery low tovery high,energisation fromvery
low to medium, and innovation remains low throughout this parameter space. Comparing with Fig. 3, we
observe that the contours of DIME values roughly match the contours for the population fractions, especially
for active conventional protesters, latent conventional protesters and latent radical protesters. In particular,
as p and F increase: 1) disidentification, moralisation, and energisation increase in value; 2) innovation
weakly decreases; 3) population fractions of active conventional protesters and latent conventional protesters
decrease; 4) population fraction of latent radical protesters increase; and 5) population fraction of active
innovators weakly decrease. Hence, looking at Fig. 4, strong presence of latent radical protesters in a
population is associated with high average values of disidentification and moralisation, medium average
values of energisation, and low average values of innovation among the population. Meanwhile, moderate
presenceofactiveconventionalprotesters,latentconventionalprotesters,andactiveinnovatorsinapopulation24
is associated with low average values of disidentification, moralisation, and energisation, and moderate
average values of innovation among the population. This dual scenario behaviour matches the results and
discussion of Fig. 2.25
II. SENSITIVITY OF POPULATION FRACTIONS OF PROTESTER TYPES AND DIME VALUES TO p,F,ϕ
AND R
In the main text, we presented and discussed in Fig. 5 the sensitivity of the long-run steady state agent
type and population fraction of the dominant agent type that emerge from our simulations for various values
of the four primary parameters, p,F,ϕ, and R. Here, we supplement that discussion by presenting and
discussing the sensitivity of the population fractions of the six individual agent types (Fig. S2a – S2f), and
the average DIME values among agents (Fig. S2h – S2k). Figure S2g is a flattened view of Fig. 5, where
it is easier to identify the exact regions that each protestor type holds dominant. Note that Fig. 3, 4 and S1
are also present within Fig. 5 and S2 as the top-right corner subplots (ϕ = 0.8 and R = 10).26

ThegeneraltrendthatwasobservedwheninvestigatingthesensitivitytopandF forϕ = 0.8andR = 10,
also holds for other combinations of ϕ and R (see Table S1). While the ‘dominant agent type’ refers to
the type which holds the highest population fraction, there can exist other agent types which hold lower,
albeit close, population fractions. For example, at low values of p and F, both latent conventional and active29

TABLE S1: Characteristics of p−F subregions regarding population fractions of individual agent types,

innovator agents show moderate presence in the population, even though the dominant action shows only
one or the other. Likewise, at medium values of p and F, both active conventional and active innovator
agents show moderate presence. Active innovators (Fig. S2c) hold their strongest presence when average
values of innovation among agents (Fig. S2i) is at its strongest (i..e. low-medium values of p and F), with
similar contours in their plots, which matches expectation.
ϕ and R affect the size of the individual subregions. As ϕ increases, the ‘low’ p−F region shrinks (as
evidenced by the decreasing region of moderate presence from latent conventional agents), the ‘medium’
p−F region expands (as evidenced by the increasing region of moderate presence from active conventional
agents), and the ‘high’ p − F region expands (as evidenced by the increasing region of strong presence
from latent radical agents). The opposite occurs as R increases, though the influence of R decreases as ϕ
increases, with changes in R having marginal effect at high ϕ.30
III. SENSITIVITY OF POPULATION FRACTIONS OF PROTESTOR TYPES AND DIME VALUES TO ϕ AND R
So far, we have presented and discussed the sensitivity of the long-run steady state agent type population
fractions and average DIME values with greater emphasis on p and F (the axes of the prior contour plots),
than ϕ and R (3-level discretization in Fig. 5 and S2). Here, we supplement by presenting and discussing
the sensitivity with respect to ϕ and R, for fixed p = 0.85 and F = 0.45, of the population fractions of the
six individual agent types (Fig. S3) and the average DIME values among agents (Fig. S4).

Fig.S4:Long-runsteadystateaverageDIMEvaluesamongagentswhenvaryingϕandR,forfixedp = 0.85
and F = 0.45. Observe that changes in R beyond 10 have negligible effect.
As ϕ increases: 1) the population fractions of active conventional and latent radical generally increase; 2)
the population fractions of active innovators and latent conventional generally decrease; 3) the population
fractions of active radical and latent innovators remain low; 4) the average values of disidentification,
moralisation,andenergisationgenerallyincrease;and5)theaveragevaluesofinnovationgenerallydecrease.
The sensitivity is strongest at medium values of ϕ.
With respect to R, we observe marginal changes in the population fractions and DIME values beyond
R = 10. Hence, the interval [1,10] captures all noticeable effects of R on the steady state values, with the
most substantial effects occurring in [1,4]. This interval of noticeable effect further shrinks depending on
the value of ϕ; e.g. for this instance of p = 0.85 and F = 0.45, R has marginal effect on the steady state
values when ϕ ≤ 0.15 or ϕ ≥ 0.65. When R does have a noticeable effect, it is opposite to that of ϕ; e.g.
latent radicalism generally increases with ϕ but decreases with R.32
IV. SENSITIVITY OF POPULATION FRACTIONS OF PROTESTER TYPES AND DIME VALUES TO INITIAL
ACTION
The results presented so far were borne from simulations run with the same initial conditions of all active
conventional agents: A (0) = 1,C (0) = 1,xh(0) = 1 ∀ i = 1,2,...,n. Here, we supplement by presenting
i i i
and discussing the long-term steady state population fractions of the agent types and average DIME values
in the responsive authority and intransigent authority scenarios that were discussed in the main text, for
the different initial conditions listed in Table S2. Figure S5 depicts barcharts of the long-run steady-state
population fractions and DIME values for the different initial conditions.

Fig. S5: Sensitivity to initial action distribution, of long-run steady state population fractions and average
DIME values among agents, in the two idealised scenarios discussed in the main text. The action bars
comprise, from top to bottom: active conventional, active innovators, active radical, latent conventional,
latent innovators, and latent radical. While the individual values vary, the final distribution is qualitatively
insensitive to the distribution of initial actions.
For the population fractions in the responsive authority scenario (Fig. S5a), we observe that the ‘all
active conventional’ and ‘all latent conventional’ initial conditions yield quantitatively similar population
fractions, with latent conventional agents making up the dominant fraction. Likewise, the ‘all active radical’
and ‘all latent radical’ initial conditions yield quantitatively similar population fractions to each other, with
active innovating agents making up the dominant fraction. The population fractions from the ‘random’
initial conditions lie in between the two groups, roughly the average of the two (which is reasonable to
expect given the equal probability of the initial condition falling under either group). Hence, the steady-
state population fractions in this scenario are quantitatively insensitive to whether agents are initially active
or latent. While there are quantitative differences in the population fractions based on whether agents are34
initially in conventional or radical orientation, the ordering of the agent types differs only by switching of
the largest two types (latent conventional and active innovator) and population fractions are roughly on the
same order of magnitude; implying qualitative similarity. Hence, the steady-state population fractions in this
scenario are qualitatively insensitive to whether agents are initially in conventional or radical orientation.
Therefore, the steady-state population fractions in this scenario are qualitatively insensitive to the initial
conditions chosen.
Similar behaviour can be observed for the other results of mean DIME values in the responsive authority
scenario (Fig. S5c), and the population fractions (Fig. S5b) and mean DIME values (Fig. S5d) in the
intransigent authority scenario scenario. Thus, these results give us confidence to believe that the results
presented in this paper are insensitive to the choice of initial conditions.35
V. COMPARISON OF NETWORK TYPES
In Fig. S6, we present visualizations of an example of the Holme-Kim network (the network type used
in our simulations) [62], and compare against the Erdo˝s–Re´nyi network (random regular). The Holme-Kim
network (Fig. S6a and S6c) was generated with N = 1000,m = 6,m = 5, and N = 13, while the
t 0
Erdo˝s–Re´nyi network (Fig. S6b and S6d) was generated with N = 1000 and p = 0.01 (probability of edge
formation). These parameters were chosen so that the two networks have similar characteristic path length
(l; 3.01 for the Holme-Kim network and 3.03 for the Erdo˝s–Re´nyi network) and average degree (< k >;
12.00 for the Holme-Kim network and 12.07 for the Erdo˝s–Re´nyi network). But despite these similarities,
there is greater clustering in the Holme-Kim network than in the Erdo˝s–Re´nyi network, as evidenced by the
global clustering coefficient: γ; 0.18 for the Holme-Kim network and 0.01 for the Erdo˝s–Re´nyi network.

were chosen so that it has similar characteristics (size, N; path length, l; average degree, < k >) as the
Holme-Kim network example. Intensity of node color indicates node degree. Note the power-law degree
distribution and the higher clustering coefficient (γ) for the Holme-Kim network.
Figures S6c and S6d show the degree distributions for the two networks, from which we can observe that
the Holme-Kim network has a power-law (scale-free) degree distribution, in contrast to the Erdo˝s–Re´nyi
network which has a normal distribution. Therefore, Holme-Kim networks are suitable for systems where
power-law degree distribution with high clustering are expected.
