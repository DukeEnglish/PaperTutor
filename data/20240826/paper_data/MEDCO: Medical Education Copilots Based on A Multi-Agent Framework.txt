Abstract. Large language models (LLMs) have had a significant im-
pact on diverse research domains, including medicine and healthcare.
However, the potential of LLMs as copilots in medical education re-
mains underexplored. Current AI-assisted educational tools are limited
by their solitary learning approach and inability to simulate the multi-
disciplinaryandinteractivenatureofactualmedicaltraining.Toaddress
these limitations, we propose MEDCO (Medical EDucation COpilots),
anovelmulti-agent-basedcopilotsystemspeciallydevelopedtoemulate
real-world medical training environments. MEDCO incorporates three
primary agents: an agentic patient, an expert doctor, and a radiolo-
gist,facilitatingamulti-modalandinteractivelearningenvironment.Our
framework emphasizes the learning of proficient question-asking skills,
multi-disciplinary collaboration, and peer discussions between students.
Our experiments show that simulated virtual students who underwent
training with MEDCO not only achieved substantial performance en-
hancements comparable to those of advanced models, but also demon-
strated human-like learning behaviors and improvements, coupled with
an increase in the number of learning samples. This work contributes
to medical education by introducing a copilot that implements an in-
teractive and collaborative learning approach. It also provides valuable
insights into the effectiveness of AI-integrated training paradigms.

1 Introduction
Large language models (LLMs) [2,29] have transformed various research do-
mains,withtheirexceptionallanguageprocessingandunderstandingskillsemerg-
ing as generalist intelligence [26]. In medicine and healthcare, LLMs have been
explored in numerous areas [20,28], from clerical work automation such as writ-
ing discharge summaries [19], to health monitoring such as dietary intake as-
sessment [16], and to an entire clinical pathway from patient presentation to
treatment involving clinical data interpretation and diagnostic suggestions [22].

With their comprehensive knowledge learned using web-scale data, a promis-
ing usage of LLMs is for medical education [10,33]. Globally, the demand for
well-trained clinicians has surpassed the capacity to adequatly train the quality
medical workforce. Over the past decades, with the development of informa-
tion engineering and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, there is a gradual
adoption of these technologies within medical education to facilitate training,
from online tutoring to AI-enabled assessment. Although recent research [23]
has shown that LLMs can score high with the accuracy of 91.1% in medical
examinations such as United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE),
their potentials and effectiveness as copilots to train medical students are yet
to be explored. While some work has shared perspectives on using a chatbot
such as ChatGPT in medical education [10,33], a single chatbot can only play
a single role at a time while engaging dialogue with a medical student, whereas
in real-world medical training, students encounter various patients and clinical
cases,andreceivesupervisionandfeedbackfromseniordoctorstoimprovetheir
clinical and patient-facing skills. Throughout the entire training course, the en-
gagementwithmultipledifferentindividualssuchaspatientsandseniordoctors,

of asking patients questions. Proficient question-asking skills can lead patients
to recall and share more pertinent information, thereby facilitating a more ac-
curate differential diagnosis. Nonetheless, existing AI-assisted educational tools
fail to equip medical students with these essential question-asking skills. Fur-
thermore, current educational tools are primarily designed for solitary learning,

tionsfrommultiplespecialtiesandclinicalsectors.Peerdiscussionsaretherefore
beneficial in helping students reflect and digest medical and clinical knowledge.
Current AI-assisted educational tools that do not sufficiently encourage peer
discussions and collaborative learning may fall short in instilling the concept of
collaboration to the students.
To realize such a training paradigm for AI-enabled medical education, and
toovercomethelimitationsofasinglechatbot,wehenceproposeamulti-agent-
based copilot for medical education, based on the conception that a medical
student has to have adequate exposure to patient encounters, feedback from
senior doctors, multi-departmental collaboration, and peer discussions for the
ease of learning. Such an AI-integrated, clinical case-based training differs from

cialist (e.g., LLaVa-Med [13], and Med-Gemini [23]), and LLM-based agentic
frameworks to demonstrate the multi-agent concept in medicine (e.g., Agent
Hospital [15]), so far there is no agentic system proposed replicating the real-
world medical training paradigm and studies its effectiveness.MEDCO: Medical Education Copilot 3

The framework of MEDCO is shown in Fig.1, which includes three stages:
agentinitialization,learning,andpracticingscenarios.Inthefirststep,MEDCO
currently involves three agents but has the capacity to incorporate more up
to a user’s configuration. These three agents are: 1) an agentic patient that
can simulate various symptoms and health conditions, and converse with the
student to allow the student to practice; 2) an agentic medical expert that can
assessthediagnosisofthestudentandthenprovidesuggestionsforimprovement
and summarize the case-specific knowledge; and 3) an agentic doctor from a
separate department to simulate multi-departmental collaboration. The agentic
patientandthemedicalexpertaretwointegralroleswithinthesystem,whereas
the agentic doctor(s) can be configured as per the requirements. In the current
configuration, we set the agentic doctor as a radiologist for interpreting medical
images and physical examinations (multi-modality support).
The learning scenario begins with an interactive diagnosis of the student.
Based on this diagnosis, the medical expert gives feedback, including sugges-
tions for improvement and relevant disease-related knowledge. In the practicing
scenario, after the initial diagnosis, the student can revisit their learned knowl-
edgeorsuggestionstoformulatemoredifferentialquestionsforafinaldiagnosis.
If there are two students, they can discuss their diagnoses together to achieve
better results.
At the current stage, we demonstrate that MEDCO is effective for agentic
learning (i.e., students played by LLM models), but we envisage when human
users, i.e., actual medical students, interact with MEDCO, they can also effec-
tivelyimprovetheirmedicalskillsandknowledge.Toevaluatetheeffectivenessof

2.1 LLMs for Medical Education
TheintroductionofChatGPThasacceleratedtheexplorationofLLMsformed-
ical education [10,33]. The early work of Kung et al. [8] revealed that Chat-
GPT could achieve a passing score of USMLE. Since then, new generations of
LLMs [23,25] have been benchmarked on USMLE extensively, with the state-
of-the-art performance achieving 91.1% accuracy [23]. While the implication of
LLMs achieving such a high USMLE score is far-reaching, little research [8] has
been conducted to integrate LLMs with existing medical educational systems
and investigate how effective they are in improving students’ learning.
Furthermore, as pointed out in [20], LLMs in education can be a double-
edged sword where learning can be more interactive and responsive with LLMs

also occur and proliferate. We refer readers to [1,20,33] for more comprehensive

2.2 LLM-based Agents
Recently, there has been a trend of shifting from a single LLM chatbot to an
agenticLLMframeworkfortasksolving,asagentscanaccesstools,plan,reflect,
and form collaborations with other agents. Within an educational setting, this
agentic paradigm resembles what a human student would experience during the
course of learning, i.e., developing reasoning skills, knowing to leverage tools,
reflect, and collaborate with others. Hence, an educational system based onMEDCO: Medical Education Copilot 5
multiple agents can be particularly promising. While there are some agentic
frameworks, such as ReAct [34], LangChain, CAMEL [14], and AutoGen [32],
they are mainly proposed for automating workflow. For example, the seminal
CAMEL work shows that the workflow of a task can be automated using an
agentic user and an agentic assistant in which the agentic user is a proxy of
human user to instruct the assistant to fulfill tasks. Recently, agentic systems
have been proposed for educational purposes such as simulated classrooms [36,
38]. Lee et al. [11] have also proposed to use generative agents to train teachers
to help them prepare for the actual in-class teaching.
There are a few studies exploring LLM agents in medical settings, and most
of them are unimodal focusing on medical text data only. Agent Hospital [15]
shows that an agentic doctor can continually improve its diagnosis by merely
interacting with agentic patients in a simulated hospital, and can transfer its
learned knowledge to real-world cases. MEDAGENTS [27] demonstrates that
multi-round discussions among agents can lead to better results than zero-/few-
shot chain-of-thought [31] on medical question answering. Similarly, AI Hos-
pital [6] shows that multi-agent discussions can enhance diagnostic accuracy.
Almanac [37], a retrieval-integrated agentic system, shows consistently better
performance than plain LLMs in clinical question answering. Nonetheless, the
above explorations of agents within medicine are still restricted by the single
text modality, whereas medicine is inherently multi-modal.
Recently, MMedAgent [12] shows that the medical task-solving capabilities
of LLMs can be widened, and their unimodal nature can be expanded to multi-
modal, through tool access, such as invoking MedSAM [17] for medical image
segmentation and ChatCAD [39] for medical report generation.
3 Method
Fig. 1 illustrates the three main steps in our framework: (1) Agent initializa-
tion: prompt different LLMs to play different roles using medical information
and different instructions; (2) Learning scenario: the agentic medical student
generates a diagnostic report according to interactions with the agentic patient
and agentic radiologist, which is then evaluated by an agentic medical expert.
The student then integrates diagnostic suggestions and case-specific knowledge
from the medical expert into its memory; (3) Practicing scenario: after the ini-
tialdiagnosisforanewclinicalcase,theagenticmedicalstudentrevisitsrelevant
suggestions or knowledge from its memory to propose further questions to the
patient and radiologist to reach a more accurate final diagnosis. The following
subsections elaborate on these three steps.

for these roles, the involved medical records can be categorized into three types.
– BasicInformation:includesessentialpatientdatasuchaschiefcomplaints,

– MedicalExamination:includesdetailedassessmentsinthediagnosticpro-

– Diagnosis and Treatment: includes diagnostic results, the rationale for

The above three categories of information will be assigned to respective agentic
characters via prompts: the agentic patient will have the access to the basic
information, the agentic radiologist will be given the medical examination, and
the agentic medical expert will use all three types of information to assess the
performance of the agentic student.
Agentic Patient: To prompt a language model as a patient, it is vital to
emphasize key patient traits and create a thorough personality profile. The pa-
tientshouldexpresssymptoms,answerquestions,participateinexams,andvoice

medical student is shown in Tables 11 to 15.MEDCO: Medical Education Copilot 7

Agentic Radiologist: In the context of simulating a radiologist using an
LLM, our approach focuses on encapsulating the multifaceted role of a radiol-
ogist within a hospital environment. Our prompt design emphasizes the core
competencies of radiological practice, including proficiency in interpreting di-
verse imaging modalities such as X-rays, CT scans, MRIs, and ultrasounds. Ad-

Examination section of medical records to ensure the radiologist communicates
findings with professional clarity. Additionally, we have developed two tools to
interpret radiological and report photos, producing both a radiology report and
a textual description, respectively. The prompt for the radiologist is shown in
Table 18 and Table 19. During conversion, the radiologist will also be referred
to as the examiner when someone requests the examination results.
Agentic Medical Expert: We developed an advanced prompting strategy
to utilize an LLM in medical education to simulate a medical expert. This role
aids in assessment, feedback, and educational support during diagnostic sce-
narios. The expert would evaluate student performance, emphasizing key skills
such as patient interaction and clinical reasoning, and identifying strengths and
weakness for improvement regarding students’ inquires, diagnostic rationales,
and treatment plans. Additionally, the model offers case-specific medical knowl-
edge, including definitions, symptoms, and treatment protocols, for students’
learning. The relevant prompts for this role are shown in Table 20, Table 21,
Table 22, and Table 13 in [6].8 H. Wei et al.
3.2 Learning Scenario
This particular scenario is designed to assist a medical student in acquiring
valuable diagnostic insights by engaging in case-based learning, which is shown
in Fig. 2 and mainly involves three steps:
(1) Initial Diagnosis:Inthisessentialfirststep,thestudentinteractswith

ing behind the diagnostic conclusions, and the corresponding treatment plans
tailored for the patient’s condition.

4 Experiments
4.1 Dataset
In this study, we used the MVME dataset [6] of Chinese medical records, which
contains 506 high-quality medical cases (text-only) across various specialties,
e.g., surgery, internal medicine, and obstetrics and gynecology. More details
aboutMVMEcanbefoundin[6].Werandomlydividedthedatasetintotraining
(259 cases) and testing (247 cases) sets at the department level for learning and
practicing scenarios, respectively.
To validate our framework’s multi-modal capability, we selected the entire
test set of 16 neurological cases from the department of internal medicine and
gatheredtheircorrespondingradiologicalimagesorreportphotosfromtheorig-
inal websites. Two example images are shown in Fig.5 in the appendix. During
the dialogue, the radiologist interprets the images of the current patient into
textual descriptions, such as a radiology report or summary of existing reports,
when requested to provide such information by the agentic patient or student.

4.3 Implementation Details
In MEDCO, distinct models are assigned to various roles: GPT-3.5 [2] acts as
the patient, while Claude-3.5-Sonnet-20240620 [3] serves as both the radiologist10 H. Wei et al.
andmedicalexpert,consideringitsexcellenceinbiologysubjects[7].Theimple-
mentation of the student’s memory and ICD-10 metrics (SEMA & CASCADE)
uses Chromadb with OpenAI embedding for efficient storage and rapid queries.
Tosimulatetheagenticradiologist’sinterpretationofvariousimagingmodal-
ities, such as radiological images and report photos, we design two tools: 1) the
Radiology tool for interpreting radiological images, and 2) the ReportVQA tool
for describing the report photos. More details can be found at the section E in
the appendix.
In addition, the diagnosis of two doctors (GPT-4 and GPT-3.5) powered by
the multi-agent system in [6] serves as the upper bound in our experiments.

4.5 Performance Gain for the Students Played by Strong Models
This subsection explores how the copilot improves performance in students
played by strong language models, exemplified by Claude3.5-Sonnet. As shown
inTables3and4,MEDCOsignificantlyenhancesagenticstudents’clinicalcon-
sultationanddiagnosticabilities,demonstratingitseffectivenessacrossdifferent
model architectures.
Table 3 reveals that the untrained agentic student scores an average of 2.283
(±0.328) in five diagnostic aspects. With copilot training, scores rise: students
using recalled knowledge could reach the average of 2.586 (±0.358), while those
using recalled suggestions could reach 2.693 (±0.128). Peer discussions yield
the highest score of 2.686 (±0.350), surpassing the 2 Agents, the average of
2.245 (±0.283). Individual performance improvements are also consistent across12 H. Wei et al.

Fine-grained level accuracy in Fig. 3(c) dramatically increases from 0% to 75%,
with the agentic student that rethinks knowledge often surpassing Claude3.5-
Sonnet. More detailed results with all metrics are available in Tables 6 and 7 in
the appendix.
Overall,MEDCOsignificantlyimprovesagenticstudents’clinicalskills,show-
ing human-like learning behaviors. This consistent performance suggests its po-
tential for real-world application in hospitals, aiding students’ educational jour-
neys.
4.7 Multi-Modal Support
The MVME dataset contains only text, so we collected corresponding images
to test our framework’s feasibility with multi-modality. We chose 16 Neurology
cases from the Department of Internal Medicine for this study. In interactive
diagnosis,radiologistsconvertvisualdatasuchasradiologicalimagesormedical
report photos into textual descriptions for student comprehension. An example
of this is shown in Fig. 10.
We utilized GPT-4o-mini, Claude3.5-Sonnet, and GPT-3.5 to initialize the
patient role and evaluate the impact of visual data on them. Results in Fig. 4
showaveragescoresfromexpertevaluations,F1-scores(SEMA),andfine-grained
levelaccuracy(CASCADE),withadditionalmetricsinTables8and9.Fromthe
results,Fig.4(a)revealsthatmulti-modalinputbenefitsstudentsinitializedwith
GPT-4o-mini and Claude3.5-Sonnet, particularly the latter, which achieves the
highest results, surpassing 2 Agents [6].
The F1-score in Fig. 4(b) indicates a strong positive effect of multi-modal
input for all variants. the agentic student(GPT-3.5) shows the highest relative
improvement,whileClaude3.5-SonnetvariantachievesthetopabsoluteF1-score,

visual data improves detailed fine-grade diagnosis. Notably, multi-modal input
significantlyboostsGPT-4o-miniandClaude3.5-Sonnetstudentperformanceto
surpass the reference.
These results suggest that the multi-modal copilot could aid students’ un-
derstanding of complex diagnoses, particularly for fine-grade assessments, by
combining visual and textual information to foster a more engaging learning
environment.
5 Discussion
Case-based learning is the core of our MEDCO framework for AI-enabled med-
ical education. It allows a student to actively interact with a virtual agentic
patient, auxiliary doctor, and medical expert for diagnosing a clinical case. This
differsfromasingle-agentchatbotinthatinsteadofoneAIcharacterisavailable,
multiplevirtualcharactersaresimulatedinMEDCOandavailablefordiscussion
at the request of the student user, replicating real-world clinical settings where14 H. Wei et al.

Agents [6], serving as the reference.
medical consultation and diagnosis can be multidisplinary and require expertise
from senior doctors as well as active engagement, cooperation from the patient.
While we have validated MEDCO from various dimensions, the student cur-
rently is only simulated and played by an LLM such as GPT-3.5. Although we

virtual students in learning, and hence the effectiveness of MEDCO for helping
human students in learning medical knowledge requires further investigation. A

the medical expert. Future work can enable the expert to provide quintessential
medical imaging examples of a learning case to offer multi-modal feedback to
improve the student’s diagnostic skill and broaden their knowledge. Similarly,
the capabilities of agentic doctors for multi-departmental collaboration can also
be expanded. For example, the agentic radiologist can also be granted access to
foundation AI models [4,5,9,21,30] or specialized AI models [17,24] as their
tools, e.g., using a segmentation model to segment and highlight lesions which
could potentially ease the learning of the student.
6 Conclusion
WehaveintroducedMEDCO,aninnovativemulti-agentcopilotsystemformed-
ical education. MEDCO enables medical students to interact dynamically with
an agentic patient, specialized doctor, and medical expert to learn about the
diagnosisandtreatmentofvariousdiseases.OurfindingsindicatethatMEDCO
can effectively adapt a generalist model for medical specialization. This adapta-
tion may also occur for human students using MEDCO, as it provides targeted
feedback tailored to individual learning cases and simulates diverse patient en-

C Memory Design
Using the dialogue case in the appendix (Fig. 6 and Fig. 7) as an example, our
memory design includes three components to store the feedback of the medical
expert in the dialog:
– Case-store: the key represents the patient ID, and the value contains the
expert’s diagnosis suggestion for that case;
– Disease-store: the key identifies the diseases in the original medical record
(the ground truth), such as cerebral infarction, hypertension, and hyperlipi-
demia, with the value corresponding to the disease-related knowledge from
the expert;
– Symptom-store: the key indicates the patient’s symptoms in the original
medical record (the ground truth), like sudden onset of unclear speech and
impaired mobility of the left limbs, with the corresponding value containing
the diagnosis results for the case and patient ID.

D Metrics
In our experiments, we design the following three metrics to validate the effec-
tiveness of our proposed copilot: MEDCO:
HDE(HolisticDiagnosticEvaluation):Thisqualitativeevaluationmethod
[6] focuses on holistically analyzing the entire diagnosis process across five spe-
cific dimensions: (1) symptoms, (2) medical examination, (3) diagnostic results,
(4) diagnostic rationales, and (5) treatment plan. Using medical records as a
reference, the medical expert rates the student’s performance on a scale of 1 to
4, from poorest to excellent, based on responses to a predefined criterion in the
prompt.
SEMA (Semantic Embedding-based Matching Assessment):Wefur-
therusetheInternationalClassificationofDiseases(ICD-10)[18]asourreference
standard. We extract disease entities from both the diagnostic results and med-
ical record references, utilizing inner-product similarity to link these entities to
ICD-10 terminology, thereby creating normalized disease sets. Unlike the orig-
inal fuzzy matching process [6], which relies solely on text similarity and may
overlook semantically similar yet textually distinct samples, we implement the
OpenAI embedding function (‘text-embedding-3-large’) to project queries and
terminology into feature space, allowing for the calculation of inner products to
identify the top-10 results. We then evaluate the diagnostic agreement between
student diagnoses and the ground truth from medical records, reporting the
number of extracted disease entities (#), set-level precision (P), recall (R), and
F1-score(F).Thismethodensuresastandardizedandcomprehensiveassessment
of diagnostic accuracy.
CASCADE (Coarse And Specific Code Assessment for Diagnostic
Evaluation): The ICD-10 [18] coding system uses a hierarchical structure to20 H. Wei et al.
classify diseases and health conditions with increasing specificity. It comprises
22 chapters, each identified by a letter (A-Z, excluding U), representing major
disease categories. Within these chapters, conditions are categorized by three-
character codes, starting with the chapter letter followed by two digits. Many
three-character categories are further subdivided with a fourth character after a
decimal, and fifth or sixth characters can also be added for greater specificity.
For example, ‘A16.202’ indicates ‘Chapter I: Certain infectious and parasitic
diseases‘ through ‘A’, ‘Respiratory tuberculosis, not confirmed bacteriologically
or histologically’ with ‘A16’, and provides further specificity with ‘A16.202’,
whichdenotes‘Tuberculosis’.WelinkdiseaseentitiestotheICD-10terminology
and hierarchically assess accuracy at three levels: coarse (A), medium (A16),
and fine grade (A16.202).
E Tools
Tosimulatetheagenticradiologist’sinterpretationofvariousimagingmodalities,
such as radiological images and report photos, we offer the following tools:
– Radiology tool: This tool interprets radiological images—like X-rays, CT
scans, and MRIs—into radiology reports that highlight key findings and
impressions.ItispoweredbytheGPT-4o-miniusingthespecializedprompt
in Table 18.
– Report VQA (vision question-answer) tool: This tool translates existing
medicalreportrecordsintotextualdescriptions,utilizingClaude-3.5-Sonnet-
20240620 with the prompt in Table 19.
These tools convert visual data into text, mimicking how radiologists interpret
patients’ imaging examinations to generate reports or answer physician ques-
tions. Except for current API-based tools, this framework supports more com-
plex options from Huggingface2, ModelScope3, or self-hosted models.
