performance in 3D environments.
their notable success is the LLMs’ capability to learn comprehensive represen-
tations from extensive sets of language and visual data. However, LLMs face
challenges with representation learning in 3D environments, which are unstruc-
tured and inherently complex. Directly using a sequence of 2D image inputs
for 2D LLMs fails to yield satisfactory results in the 3D world [15]. Therefore,
learning high fidelity and accuracy of 3D representations could enable more in-
tuitive and versatile AI systems that understand and interact with the physical
3D world in a more human-like manner.
A recent advancement 3D-LLM [15] marks the inaugural attempt to utilize
point clouds as representations for 3D LLMs, as illustrated in Fig. 1 (a). How-
ever,3D-LLMgeneratesrepresentationsofflinethroughanisolatedandcomplex
process, lifting 2D features to point clouds extracted from input depth, ground
truth(GT)geometry,or3Dscenesreconstructedbyauxiliarymodels.Whileus-
ing GT point clouds as input can yield commendable performance for 3D-LLM,
the acquisition of such GT data is both expensive and challenging. Conversely,
depending on the geometry predicted by the reconstruction models as input to
3D-LLM has demonstrated subpar performance, as discussed in Sec. 4.6. This
performance discrepancy arises because 3D-LLM relies solely on point clouds
to provide spatial positions without establishing 3D point-to-point connections
or fusing 3D geometric and semantic information. Consequently, the 3D rep-
resentations exhibit sparse scene connectivity and a lack of spatial structural
information, causing 3D-LLM’s performance to be notably affected by the qual-
ity of the scene geometry. These limitations highlight the necessity for furtherUni3DR2 3
advancements in 3D representation design, which can effectively bridge the gap
between LLMs and complex 3D environments.

utilize trainable encoders solely for geometric features, our 2D encoder is com-
bined with two frozen vision foundation backbones. Notably, one backbone is
derived from SAM [22], pretrained on extensive sets of human-verified object
masks, for extracting object-level information. The other backbone is sourced
from CLIP [30], pretrained on massive image-text data, to capture semantically
rich features. Then a 3D decoder equipped with multi-scale Gated Recurrent
Unit (GRU) fusion is introduced for the generation of 3D geometric and seman-

2 Related Work
3D Vision and Language plays a pivotal role in enabling machines to com-
prehend 3D environments in applications like robotics [13,41] and embodied
AI[21,39].Severalrecent3Dtasks[1,2,4,5,14]evaluatethevisualandlanguage

graph representation [12,18] or multimodal Transformer [3,6,44,45,50]. Re-
cent work 3D-LLM [15] combines 3D representations and large language models
(LLMs) [23] to solve 3D vision-language tasks. Specifically, 3D-LLM extracts4 T. Chu et al.
3D representations from 2D images via extra depth map, SLAM [20], or NeRF
model [37]. Different from 3D-LLM, our Uni3DR2 uses the volumetric represen-
tationandreconstructionfromasequenceofimages,whichismoreaccurateand
general in handling different scenes for LLMs. Our Uni3DR2 primarily focuses
on feature representation and reconstruction, which is orthogonal to previous
methods [17] and can be integrated together.
3D Reconstruction aims to reconstruct 3D scenes from input images, which
main contains depth-based methods [7,33,35] and volumetric methods [34,38].
SimpleRecon [35] is proposed to input metadata into the feature volume and
then follow a 2D encoder-decoder to predict depth. VolumeFusion [7] utilizes

PIFu [34] predicts the continuous inside/outside probability field to obtain the
3D occupancy. NeuralRecon [38] is proposed to predict a discrete TSDF volume
using GRU fusion. Depth-based reconstruction methods are prone to distur-
bancesindepthvalues,makingitchallengingtoobtainstablereconstructionre-

tion approaches [34,38] usually rely on small, learnable image encoders, which
limited their ability to provide semantically rich 3D representations. Different
from previous methods, we use the frozen encoders from segmentation-anything
(SAM) [22] and CLIP [30] to extract semantically rich 3D representations.

these foundation models as image encoders, extracting both rich geometric and
semantic features.

At the forefront of this technology is OpenAI’s GPT series [26,31,32]. These

have emerged, such as PaLm [8], OPT [49] and LLaMa [42]. Notably, the field
has seen recent strides in the development of Multimodal LLMs, such as GPT-
4 [26], BLIP2 [23], PaLmE [10] and 3D-capable models 3D-LLM [15]. These

3 Methodology
This section describes the framework of our Uni3DR2-LLM — a unified model
understanding 3D scenes from 2D video inputs. Fig. 2 illustrates the framework
of Uni3DR2-LLM, which comprises a unified module for predicting 3D repre-
sentations r and reconstruction results g , and a Large Language Model for 3D
n
vision-language tasks. Unlike the previous method [15], which lifts extracted 2D
features into expensive GT point clouds or predicted geometry for LLMs, re-
sulting in generated representation with sparse scene connectivity and a lack of
spatial structural information, our proposed Uni3DR2 aims to establish 3D geo-
metric and semantically rich representations for both reconstruction and LLMs.

Decoder. We use a 3D decoder D to fuse the 2D features e into 3D repre-
sentations r. The decoder D builds the relationship of voxels in 3D space with
multi-scale and coarse-to-fine strategies. Specifically, the encoder feature e is
input into n levels of convolution operators. This process yields the multi-scale
features, denoted as ein ={ein,ein,...,ein}. For the i-th level,

Theprevious3DLLMmethod[15]directlylifts2DfeaturestoGT/predicted

lack of spatial structural information. In contrast, our 3D decoder tackles these
issues by establishing 3D point-to-point connections, fusing both geometric and
semantic information into 3D representations. Consequently, it enhances both
reconstruction and LLMs.

Subsequently, we combine the sampled 3D representations r with the 3D

point coordinates c∈RB×N×3 to serve as the inputs for the LLM. The coordi-
nates c refer to the points in r . To enhance spatial understanding and capture
s

the position embeddings along each axis dimension:
p=concat{L (c ),L (c ),L (c )}. (6)

Give the axis dimension j ∈ {x,y,z}, the symbol c denotes the values

Drawing inspiration from BLIP2 [23], we first feed our input features r

ing through LLM for dialogue generation. The 3D visual features for LLM are
computed as follows:

Following this, we keep the 3D visual features l fixed and introduce ques-

4 Experiments
In this section, we conduct experiments on different tasks, including 3D recon-
struction (see Section 4.2) and 3D vision-language understanding (discussed in
Section 4.3 and Section 4.4). We compare our method with the state-of-the-art
methods on 3D vision-language understanding and provide an ablation study
(see Section 4.6) to highlight the effectiveness of each component.
4.1 Experiment Setup
Datasets.Oursettingexclusivelyacceptsvideoasinput,requiringexperiments
to be conducted on datasets that offer video or multi-view images. Therefore,
datasets featuring only point clouds as inputs, such as the Held-In Dataset in
3D-LLM [14], are unsuitable for our experimentation. Hence, we select the (1)
ScanNet [9] dataset for 3D reconstruction analysis. ScanNet includes 1,513
indoor scenes with videos, depths, and meshes for reconstruction, and we follow
the training/validation splits of Atlas [24]. We also select two representative 3D
vision-language datasets: (2) the ScanQA dataset [2] contains 41,363 questions
from 800 indoor scenes. (3) the 3DMV-VQA [14] dataset that encompasses
50k questions. The questions of 3DMV-VQA are designed to test models on
various aspects like concepts, counting, relational, and comparative analyses. In
summary, our dataset selections provide a well-rounded basis for evaluating the
effectiveness of our method in both 3D reconstruction and 3D vision-language
understanding capabilities.
Implementation Details. We use pre-trained image encoders from SAM [22]
and CLIP [30] as the foundational modules for our 2D encoding process. The

4.2 3D Reconstruction on ScanNet
Baselines. We choose NeuralRecon [38] as the baseline for our reconstruction.
NeuralRecon is widely recognized for its simplicity and effectiveness in 3D re-
construction, providing seamless feature fusion through volumetric features. To
create our 3D geometric and semantic representation, we modify the encoder-
decoder framework of NeuralRecon. Furthermore, we compare our reconstruc-
tion model with several other competitive approaches. COLMAP [36] designs a
pixel-wiseviewselectionmechanism.MVDepthNet[43]usesanencoder-decoder
structure with geometric data augmentation. GPMVS [16] uses temporal infor-
mationbetweenframes.DPSNet[19]usesthetraditionalplanesweepalgorithm

Fig.3: 3D reconstruction visualization results on ScanNet. Compared to the
baseline method [38] (second column), our method (third column) predicts the recon-
struction results with more semantic details. (Zoom in for details.).
Metrics. We utilize the metrics introduced in Atlas [24] to evaluate our re-
construction results, including Abs Rel, Abs Diff, and RMSE for depth and
F-Score for geometry. These metrics represent the relative error, absolute error,
and mean-square error when comparing the depth rendered from predicted ge-
ometry to the ground truth depth. Additionally, the F-Score metric denotes to
the F1 score calculated for the the predicted point cloud in comparison to the
ground truth point cloud.
Results. As shown in Tab. 1, the results highlight the superior reconstruction
performanceofourUni3DR2,achievingnotableimprovementsonScanNetacross

sentationsnotonlyencompassmorecomprehensiveinformationbutalsoexhibit
a stronger reconstruction capability, leading to a 1.8% increase in F-Score.
Qualitative 3D Reconstruction. Fig. 3 presents the 3D reconstruction visu-
alization results on ScanNet. Thanks to our geometric and semantic represen-
tations, Uni3DR2 excels in reconstructing objects with high completeness and
more intricate edge details. This is evident in finer aspects, such as the back of
a chair (top row), the deck (second row), and the wash basin (third row). Our
reconstructed objects exhibit detailed coherence without any interruptions or
breaks.Uni3DR2 11

3D Vision-Language Understanding. However, a direct comparison between our
Uni3DR2-LLM and 3D-LLM which uses GT point clouds is not fair. Therefore,
we replace the GT point clouds in 3D-LLM with the point clouds predicted by
ourUni3DR2toestablishafairbaseline.Furthermore,wecompareourUni3DR2-
LLMwithseveralothercompetitiveapproaches.VoteNet+MCAN[28,48]applies
VoteNet to extract 3D point cloud objects and uses extracted features in the
MCAN model for VQA. ScaneRefer+MCAN [4,48] employs PointNet++ [29]
to extract point cloud and lifting features by MCAN. ScanQA [2] fuses the
point cloud features with pre-trained language embeddings such as GloVe [27].
Additionally,wecompareourUni3DR2-LLMwithLLMsthattakesingle/multi-
view image features as input.
Metrics. We utilize a comprehensive set of metrics to assess performance, in-
cluding BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE-L, CIDEr, and EM. BLEU (Bilingual Eval-
uation Understudy) serves as an indicator of text generation accuracy by com-
paring the overlap of n-grams (sequential word or character sequences) in the
generatedtextwiththosein referencetext.METEOR(MetricforEvaluation of
Translation with Explicit Ordering) offers a nuanced evaluation of translation
quality,takingintoaccountfactorssuchasprecision,recall,stemming,andsyn-
onymy. ROUGE-L focuses specifically on measuring the overlap of the longest
common subsequences between a reference text (ground truth) and a system-
generated summary or text. CIDEr evaluates both word accuracy and the con-
sensus among multiple human-generated reference captions. Lastly, EM (Exact12 T. Chu et al.

4.6 Ablation Studies
Encoder Design Choices. The encoder in Our Uni3DR2 incorporates two
frozen pre-trained models: the CLIP visual encoder and the SAM visual en-
coder.InTab.5,wedetailtheresultsofourablationstudies,whichquantifythe
contribution of each component to the 3D reconstruction. The study compares
four configurations: “NeuralRecon” without either pretrained encoder, “Rec ”
C
with only the frozen CLIP encoder, “Rec ” with only the frozen SAM encoder,
S
and“Rec ” withbothencodersactive. Acomparisonbetweentheperformance
CS
of “Rec ” and “NeuralRecon” indicates that Clip features, which focus on se-
C
mantics, display reduced performance while still providing valuable geometric
information for 3D reconstruction. When Comparing “Rec ” to “NeuralRecon”,
S
it becomes apparent that SAM features, enriched with object-level information,
demonstratesuperiorgeometriccapabilitiescomparedtothebaselinemodelwith
a trained encoder. Moreover, an analysis of the performance of “Rec ” in re-
CS
lation to both “Rec ” and “Rec ” reveals that the fusion of Clip features and
C S
SAM features yields more comprehensive information, resulting in superior re-
construction outcomes.
Representation. In Tab. 6, we demonstrate the importance of representation
on the ScanQA dataset. The study compares six configurations: “CLIP (Multi-
View)” withoutliftingandgeometry,3D-LLMdenotedas“CLIP (3D-LLM)”
proj
with “GT” point clouds, the baseline represented by “CLIP (3D-LLM)” with
proj

a notable improvement of 4.0% and 4.2% in BLEU-1 on val and test of ScanQA

Finally, when comparing our Uni3DR2-LLM with 3D-LLM, our unified model
effectively mitigate the impact of reconstruction quality, resulting in higher per-
formance compared to 3D-LLM which uses GT point clouds.Uni3DR2 15
5 Conclusion
Our research addresses a critical challenge in applying Large Language Mod-
els (LLMs) to 3D environments: the acquisition of effective 3D representations
suitable for LLMs. Compared to structural 1D text or 2D images, 3D scene
representations are hard to interpret and manipulate, which highlights the need
for research of advanced processing and representation learning algorithms. We
emphasize the significance of geometric and semantically rich features and in-
troduceaunifiedmodulefor3Drepresentationandreconstruction.Futurework
will explore scaling our method to enhance more 3D capabilities with LLMs,
including advancing 3D scene perception and 3D generation.
