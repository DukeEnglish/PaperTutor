1Abstract
This paper presents TimelinePTC, a web-based tool developed to improve the
collection and analysis of Pathways to Care (PTC) data in first episode psychosis (FEP)
research. Accurately measuring the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) is essential
for effective FEP treatment, requiring detailed understanding of the patient's journey to
care. However, traditional PTC data collection methods, mainly manual and paper-
based, are time-consuming and often fail to capture the full complexity of care
pathways.
TimelinePTC addresses these limitations by providing a digital platform for
collaborative, real-time data entry and visualization, thereby enhancing data accuracy
and collection efficiency. Initially created for the Specialized Treatment Early in
Psychosis (STEP) program in New Haven, Connecticut, its design allows for
straightforward adaptation to other healthcare contexts, facilitated by its open-source
codebase.
The tool significantly simplifies the data collection process, making it more
efficient and user-friendly. It automates the conversion of collected data into a format
ready for analysis, reducing manual transcription errors and saving time. By enabling
more detailed and consistent data collection, TimelinePTC has the potential to improve
healthcare access research, supporting the development of targeted interventions to
reduce DUP and improve patient outcomes.
2Introduction
Understanding the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) is crucial in the
treatment of first episode psychosis (FEP) [1-3]. DUP, the time from the onset of
psychosis symptoms to the initiation of treatment, has been identified as a critical factor
influencing the outcomes of treatment [4-6]. Consequently, there is a pressing need to
not only quantify DUP but also to dissect and understand the pathways to care (PTC)
that individuals travel from symptom onset to clinical treatment [7]. Analyzing these
pathways provides invaluable insights into potential delays and barriers both outside
and within the healthcare system and can inform interventions to improve the
experience of seeking care and reducing the delays in accessing it [8].
Despite the recognized importance of mapping pathways to care, significant gaps
exist in both data collection and analysis. Surprisingly, most FEP services, which are
specifically designed to intervene early in the illness course, fail to collect any pathways
to care data [9]. Of the few that do report on pathways to care, most collect or analyze
their data in ways that significantly limit inferential power. These approaches typically
involve manually reconstructing pathways either from electronic medical records (EMR)
alone or through patient interviews supplemented by EMR review, often without a
standardized format [10,11]. This ad hoc methodology results in significant variability in
the quality and granularity of the data collected, making it difficult to compare across
studies or to draw broad conclusions about barriers to care. Further, the PTC data
collected for these studies are not scoped to capture the patient’s full journey to care,
instead focusing on a few key time measures (e.g. help-seeking delay). And these
3measures themselves are determined a priori, not suggested by, or inferred from the
data.
Even within the subset of studies that prioritize the collection of high-quality PTC
data, the prevailing reliance on paper-based tools poses significant challenges [8,12].
These traditional methods of data collection are often time-consuming and designed
with a research-centric perspective, rather than being patient-focused. Moreover, they
typically impose a predetermined structure on the data being collected, such as
categorizing experiences into "episodes of care" [13]. This approach, while systematic,
may not necessarily capture the full complexity or the nuances of individual pathways to
care, potentially overlooking critical aspects of the patient's journey that are vital for a
comprehensive analysis. While there are rare instances of studies attempting to
innovate within this space — notable examples being a single study that adopted digital
forms for data collection [14] and another unique approach utilizing a paper visual
timeline to facilitate collaborative data collection with participants [15] — these remain
exceptions rather than the norm. Such efforts to modernize PTC data collection
highlight the existing gap and the need for more interactive, flexible, and patient-
centered tools that collect granular, complete, and valid PTC data.
Therefore, we introduce TimelinePTC, designed specifically to overcome these
challenges. Built to be digital, visual, and interactive, TimelinePTC changes how
pathways to care data are collected. It allows for real-time, joint data entry and
visualization between researchers and participants, improving both the quality and
accuracy of the data while making the process more efficient. TimelinePTC provides a
flexible and easy-to-use platform that can be adjusted for different analytic needs,
4significantly enhancing our ability to understand and address pathways to care in first
episode psychosis.
Software description
TimelinePTC is a data collection and visualization tool, engineered to capture the
complex journeys patients undertake from the onset of symptoms to their enrollment in
coordinated specialty care.
Opening the interface, users are prompted to input critical baseline information,
including a participant ID, an estimated date of symptom onset (confirmed or to be
confirmed via a separate structured assessment), and the date of enrollment in the FEP
clinic (Fig 1a). These data then frame the interactive timeline that stretches from the
reported onset of illness to clinic enrollment, with months and years marked as
reference points (Fig 1b).

information 1b. The timeline drawn from these dates 1c. The interface that pops up
when the timeline is clicked 1d. The timeline showing an event that has been entered
1e. A more robust pathway to care 1f. PTC data extracted to comma-separated values
(CSV) format.
The user interface is simple, offering an intuitive timeline as the centerpiece for
both data entry and visualization. This timeline is not just a passive display; it is a
5canvas for interaction. The research assistant, using a semi-structured intake script,
prompts for key events on the timeline [See S1 Table].
These events are added to the timeline by clicking on the corresponding point
along the timeline which opens a popup window where more detailed information about
the event can be entered (Fig 1c). The types of events are adapted from those
empirically derived from our previous PTC analyses [8] and are grouped into clinical
nodes (individuals or agencies providing clinical care – e.g. emergency departments,
primary care providers, therapists) and community nodes (those with the capacity to
facilitate access to treatment – e.g. family members, police officers, teachers). There is
also an option for “other” node types not explicitly listed. First antipsychotic prescribed
for psychosis is its own event class and serves to demarcate the transition between
care epochs in subsequent analysis.
As the clinic staff uses the intake script to probe for information, responses are
visualized in real-time on the timeline through the addition of icons representing different
events (Figs 1d, 1e). This iterative process not only ensures comprehensive coverage
of the patient's healthcare journey but also engages the participant in the process,
making it more collaborative and transparent. This dynamic interaction facilitated by
TimelinePTC encourages a deep dive into the patient's experiences, prompting
recollection and discussion of both antecedent and subsequent healthcare interactions.
The live visual representation of the data not only aids in ensuring accuracy and
completeness but also provides the patient and clinic staff with a holistic view of the
healthcare journey as it unfolds.
6In addition to its robust in-person data collection capabilities, TimelinePTC
seamlessly adapts to the evolving landscape of healthcare by integrating smoothly with
telehealth settings. Utilizing screen-sharing features of commonly used telehealth
platforms, TimelinePTC allows for real-time, remote collaboration between clinic staff
and participants. This adaptation not only maintains the interactive and engaging nature
of the tool but also extends its accessibility, ensuring that data collection and
visualization can proceed uninterrupted, regardless of physical distance. This
integration with telehealth technologies underscores TimelinePTC's flexibility and
commitment to facilitating comprehensive care pathway analysis in a variety of clinical
environments, further enhancing its utility in modern healthcare contexts.
Once the data collection phase is complete, one of TimelinePTC’s most powerful
features comes into play: the ability to instantly export the collected data into a digital
format optimized for downstream analytics (Fig 1f). This seamless transition from data
collection to analysis represents a key advantage, eliminating the time-consuming and
error-prone process of translating paper-based records into digital data.
Development and implementation
Development
TimelinePTC was developed as part of an ongoing research study on first
episode psychosis at the Specialized Treatment Early in Psychosis (STEP) program in
New Haven, Connecticut that had been manually collecting PTC data for nearly a
decade. The development was driven by two main needs: the existing PTC scale did
7not capture all the necessary data for robust, granular delay analysis, and the manual
transcription of paper data into a digital format was onerous.
A preliminary version of the data collection and visualization interface was
created by a team member (WSM) with a focus on data analysis. This version was then
refined through workshops with the research team, including those experienced in data
collection from study participants, who provided practical feedback on its functionality.
Following integration of this feedback, TimelinePTC was pilot tested with participants
newly entering the study, which helped identify technical issues and gather further
suggestions for improvement. This pilot testing occurred between January 26 and
March 19, 2024. All subjects provided informed consent within a protocol approved by
the Yale Human Investigations Committee.
Alongside the development of the software, a semi-structured interview format
was also created to better guide the data collection process. After testing and
refinement, TimelinePTC was adopted to replace the traditional paper-based PTC data
collection method in the study.
Technical framework
TimelinePTC is coded in JavaScript and HTML, technologies chosen for their
universal compatibility and ease of deployment across a wide range of devices. This
technical framework ensures that TimelinePTC can be effortlessly accessed and utilized
on various platforms, from smartphones and tablets to laptops and desktop computers,
without the need for any specialized software – merely a web browser is sufficient. This
8also supports flexibility for data collection in diverse environments, including clinics,
research laboratories, and fieldwork settings.
All computer code is run locally, ensuring that sensitive data, such as protected
health information including dates of healthcare services rendered, never leave the local
device. This allows clinics and research facilities to decide the most appropriate method
for managing the data output – e.g. saving on a secure, local computer system,
transferring to an encrypted thumb drive, or opting for storage in a HIPAA-compliant
cloud-based repository.
Design philosophy
The design philosophy behind TimelinePTC is rooted in the principles of speed,
portability, and clarity, aimed at facilitating a seamless and efficient user experience.
The software's visual language is intentionally sparse, drawing inspiration from PTC
visualizations developed in our prior analyses [8]. This minimalist approach is not
merely an aesthetic choice but a deliberate effort to put the emphasis squarely on the
data being collected and displayed. By reducing visual clutter, TimelinePTC ensures
that clinic staff and participants can easily interpret and evaluate the information without
distraction, fostering a clear and focused environment for data entry and review.
Moreover, the straightforward and unobtrusive interface of TimelinePTC is crafted
to keep users engaged in their cooperative task without becoming preoccupied with
navigating or manipulating the software itself. The aim is to create a digital space where
technology serves as a silent partner in the data collection process, enhancing the
interaction between research assistants and participants rather than overshadowing it.
9This approach ensures that the software's functionality enhances the collaborative
experience, making TimelinePTC not just a tool for data collection, but a facilitator of
meaningful dialogue and discovery in the pathway to care research.
Accessibility and licensing
TimelinePTC has been developed with a strong commitment to accessibility and
open collaboration. It is currently hosted on a public GitHub repository, readily
accessible to all who wish to utilize this innovative tool for pathways to care data
collection and visualization (https://github.com/StanMathisYale/TimelinePTC). This not
only facilitates ease of access but also encourages contributions from the global
development community, allowing for enhancements, customizations, and potentially
new features driven by user feedback and collaborative innovation.

Use cases and applications
10TimelinePTC, initially developed for the STEP clinic in New Haven, Connecticut,
has recently been integrated into the program’s growth to statewide coverage. This
expansion has underscored the software's capability to scale effectively, meeting the
growing demand for efficient data collection across a broader geographic area.
Feedback from researchers and clinicians involved in data collection has been positive,
including from those accustomed to the previous paper-based methods. Despite an
initial adjustment period, users report feeling comfortable with TimelinePTC after just
one session, highlighting its intuitive design and ease of use.
These frontline users report the most notable advantages of TimelinePTC being
the speed with which data can be collected and the ability for real-time data review with
participants. These features not only streamline the data collection process but also
enhance the accuracy and completeness of the information gathered, as participants
can directly verify and contribute to their data. This immediate feedback loop has been
appreciated by those involved in the STEP program, emphasizing the tool's role in
facilitating a more participant-engaged research approach.
From the data analysis perspective, the transition to TimelinePTC has brought
about an improvement in efficiency and data quality. Previously, researchers faced the
laborious task of manually extracting PTC data from stacks of paper forms, a process
fraught with inefficiency and the potential for error. With TimelinePTC, this cumbersome
step is eliminated, as the software automatically generates a comma-separated values
(CSV) file that is ready for analysis. This automation has resulted in a substantial time
saving, estimated at approximately 20 minutes per participant, drastically reducing the
workload for the data analysis team and accelerating the pace at which research
11findings can be generated and applied. Also, when previously using the prior paper
method, up to 10% of PTCs were excluded from post hoc analysis because they were
internally inconsistent or there was insufficient data to fully reconstruct the full PTC [8].
The format and constraints of TimelinePTC make this outcome nearly impossible.
The high-quality, complete, and granular PTC data collected via TimelinePTC
combine with its automatic, optimally formatted data output to enable powerful analytic
products that were previously challenging to achieve. These data, whether analyzed
individually or concatenated for system-wide metrics, furnish actionable insights crucial
for enhancing FEP services. System-wide network visualizations produced from these
data allow for the detailed mapping and analysis of care pathways across the entire
healthcare network. This visualization illuminates the complex interplay between all care
nodes, identifying clustering, bottlenecks, and inefficiencies within the system [8 and S1
Fig]. Additionally, the data collected with TimelinePTC facilitate highly granular marginal
delay analysis, offering a nuanced understanding of how specific node subtypes
contribute to delays in care [8 and S2 Table]. Such detailed analyses enable targeted
interventions and optimizations within FEP services, directly addressing the factors that
prolong DUP. Consequently, TimelinePTC stands as a pivotal tool in supporting FEP
research and service delivery, providing a foundation for data-driven improvements and
innovations in patient care pathways.
Discussion
TimelinePTC represents a significant advancement in the study of pathways to
care (PTC). This web-based application, crafted with JavaScript and HTML, is designed
12to facilitate the process of collecting and visualizing PTC data in a dynamic, interactive,
and collaborative manner. By transitioning from traditional paper-based methods to a
digital platform, we have enhanced the accuracy, efficiency, and accessibility of PTC
data collection.
A potential limitation to its current form is the local specificity of some of its data
language. Developed within the specific context of the STEP program in Connecticut,
some of TimelinePTC's language reflect aspects of the healthcare network of that area
(e.g. the names of predetermined node types). However, its open-source nature and
straightforward codebase invite adaptation and customization by other research teams
across various healthcare contexts. The software's flexibility means that it can be readily
modified to suit different settings or populations, broadening its applicability and
potential impact.
Looking forward, the implications of TimelinePTC's adoption extend far beyond
immediate improvements in data collection efficiency. By making it easier for teams to
adapt the tool to new contexts, TimelinePTC paves the way for a broader understanding
of healthcare navigation across different diseases, demographic groups, and healthcare
systems. This adaptability not only accelerates research in FEP but also opens doors to
exploring patient pathways in other healthcare scenarios where understanding the
transition from illness onset to clinical care is crucial (e.g. timelines of substance use or
pathways to cancer care)
The long-term benefits of TimelinePTC's widespread use could support
healthcare access research by providing more granular insights into the barriers and
facilitators of care. Such insights are invaluable in designing interventions that are more
13targeted and effective at improving healthcare access and outcomes. Ultimately,
TimelinePTC is an example of how technology can enhance research methodologies,
offering a promising avenue for future explorations that could lead to substantial
improvements in patient care and healthcare system efficiency.
Conclusions
In summary, this web-based software offers a groundbreaking approach to
collecting and visualizing pathways to care data. Through its interactive timeline,
detailed event logging, and instant data export capabilities, the tool not only streamlines
the research process but also enhances the quality and utility of the data collected,
promising to advance the field of healthcare access research significantly.

Let us now try to look at the pathways to care. Individuals and families often follow
unique pathways to access care, when seeking help after the onset of illness
(psychosis). We are interested in learning about your journey since your symptoms first
appeared and try to capture each help-seeking event. During our conversation, we will
attempt to recall and record the date of every interaction – both clinical and non-clinical
– that occurred along the path. When exact dates are not available, we will do our best
to estimate. We will enter this information in a visual tool where you can see this
information and fill in the gaps, if any.
