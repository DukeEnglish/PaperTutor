Abstract
Pattern discovery plays a central role in both descriptive and predictive tasks across multiple do-
mains. Actionable patterns must meet rigorous statistical significance criteria and, in the presence
oftargetvariables,furtherupholddiscriminativepower. Ourworkaddressestheunderexploredarea
of guiding pattern discovery by integrating statistical significance and discriminative power crite-
ria into state-of-the-art algorithms while preserving pattern quality. We also address how pattern
quality thresholds, imposed by some algorithms, can be rectified to accommodate these additional
criteria. To test the proposed methodology, we select the triclustering task as the guiding pat-
tern discovery case and extend well-known greedy and multi-objective optimization triclustering
algorithms, δ-Trimax and TriGen, that use various pattern quality criteria, such as Mean Squared
Residual (MSR), Least Squared Lines (LSL), and Multi Slope Measure (MSL). Results from three
case studies show the role of the proposed methodology in discovering patterns with pronounced
improvements of discriminative power and statistical significance without quality deterioration,
highlighting its importance in supervisedly guiding the search. Although the proposed methodol-

1 Introduction
Pattern mining is a widely researched field of data analysis that has served as the backbone of
decision-makingacrossmanyfieldsofexpertise[33]. Inthiscontext,knowledgeacquisitionisdriven
by the discovery of unexpectedly frequent substructures from a given data structure. In tabular
data,patterndiscoverygenerallyaimstofindcoherentsubspacesdefinedbysubsetsofobservations
and variables [24]. When handling more complex data structures (e.g. cubic data, three-way data)
triclustering algorithms define coherent subspaces across the three dimensions, typically referred
to as sub-cubes or triclusters [20]. Finding coherent subspaces depends on the merit function
implemented by the algorithm to guide the search. Typically, algorithms ensure that extracted
patterns (1) are dissimilar, (2) yield statistical significance e.g. an unexpectedly low probability of
occurrence against a null data model, and (3) meet rigorous quality criteria [20]. Additionally, in
the presence of annotated data, patterns can be assessed using interestingness measurements [2].
Patterns exhibiting a high discriminative power towards an outcome of interest play a central role
in enhancing predictive tasks [4, 31].

1v00021.1042:viXraCurrent research in the field of discriminative pattern mining aims at improving the efficiency
of the searches [30], reducing false positive discoveries [19], promoting actionability [29], and using
discriminative patterns to guide predictive approaches [21]. Complementarily, statistical tests for
assessing the statistical significance of patterns have been considered for transactional data struc-
tures [32]. In this context, statistical significance criteria are applied to the pattern discriminative
power and not the pattern itself [32]. Additionally, others in the field focus on capturing different
types of correlation [13, 14], improving algorithms to handle different data types [10] and their
scalability [26]. To the best of our knowledge, there are no approaches that integrate quality crite-
ria, discriminative criteria, and statistical significance to guide pattern discovery. In this context,
we provide an in-depth discussion on how to properly incorporate statistical significance and dis-
criminative criteria intothemeritfunctionsofstate-of-the-artalgorithmswithoutforgoingpattern

the pursued merit functions as imposed by some algorithms (e.g. δ-Trimax [8]).
Considering the increasing ability to monitor the behavior of systems along time, a notable rise
in the availability of tensor data structures, particularly three-way data, has been observed. The

posed methodology in the context of three case studies. We observe that the algorithms produce
significantimprovementsinboththediscriminative power andstatistical significance oftheformed
patterns. The proposed methodology is not algorithm-constrained nor data-constrained, thus it
can be extended and used with any N-dimensional pattern mining algorithm.
The paper is organized as follows: the remainder of this section provides the essential back-
ground. Section 2 introduces the proposed methodology. Section 3 discusses the gathered results
from real-world and synthetic data. Concluding remarks and implications are finally drawn.
1.1 Background
Consider a two-dimensional dataset (matrix data), denoted as A, defined by n observations (X =
x ,...,x ) and m variables (Y = y ,...,y ), featuring n×m elements a . The tasks of clustering
1 n 1 m ij
and biclustering aim to extract clusters I ⊆ X or biclusters B = (I ,J ), each represented by a
i k k k
subset of observations I ⊆X correlated on a subset of variables J ⊆Y. Homogeneity criteria,
k k
typically ensured through the application of a merit function, guide the formation of (bi)clusters
[24]. For a given bicluster, its values a = c +γ +η can be explained by value expectations
ij j i ij
c , adjustments γ , and noise η . If each element of A corresponds to a bicluster, the bicluster
j i ij
pattern φ is the ordered set of values in the absence of adjustments and noise, expressed as
B
φ = {c |y ∈ J}. In addition to the homogeneity criteria, criteria for statistical significance
B j j
[19]ensurethattheprobabilityofabicluster’soccurrence(comparedtoanullmodel)deviatesfrom
expectations. Moreover, dissimilarity criteria [18] can be applied to further ensure the absence of
redundant biclusters.
A three-dimensional dataset (three-way tensor data), denoted as A, is characterized by n ob-
servations X = {x ,...,x }, m variables Y = {y ,...,y }, and p contexts Z = {z ,...,z }. The
1 n 1 m 1 p
elements a establish a connection between observation x , attribute y , and context z . Similar
ijk i j k
to two-dimensional data, three-dimensional data can be real-valued (a ∈R), symbolic (a ∈Σ,
ijk ijk
where Σ is a set of nominal or ordinal symbols), integer (a ∈ Z), or non-identically distributed

When the context dimension represents a set of time points (Z = {t ,t ,...,t }), we encounter a
1 2 p
temporal three-dimensional dataset, also known as m-order multivariate time series data.
Given three-way tensor data A with n observations, m variables, and p contexts/time points,
a tricluster T = (I,J,K) represents a subspace of the original space, where I ⊆ X, J ⊆ Y, and
K ⊆ Z are subsets of observations, variables, and contexts/time points, respectively [20]. The
triclustering task aims to discover a set of triclusters T = {T ,...,T } such that each tricluster
1 l
T satisfies specific criteria of homogeneity, dissimilarity, and statistical significance. Each element
i
of a tricluster, a , is described by a base value c , observation adjustment γ , and noise η .
ijk jk i ijk
The tricluster pattern, φ , constitutes an ordered set of value expectations along the subset of
T
variables and context dimensions in the absence of adjustments and noise: φ = {c |y ∈ J,z ∈
T jk j k
K,c ∈ Y }. The coverage Φ of the tricluster pattern φ , denoted as Φ(φ ), corresponds to the
jk k T T
number of observations containing the tricluster pattern φ . This same logic can be extended to
T
a nominal outcome of interest c, where c can take any value in the class variable. The coverage of
the outcome, defined as Φ(c), represents the number of observations with the outcome of interest.
For instance, considering the class variable y =[a,b,a,a], the coverage Φ(a) is equal to 3/4.

Homogeneity criteria play a crucial role in determining the structure, coherence, and quality
of a triclustering solution [20]. In this context:
– the structure is defined by the number, size, shape, and position of triclusters;
– the coherence of a tricluster is defined by the observed correlation of values (coherence as-
sumption) and the allowed deviation from expectations (coherence strength);
– the quality of a tricluster is defined by the type and amount of tolerated noise.
Atriclusterexhibitsconstant coherencewhenthesubspacedemonstratesconstantvalues(for
symbolic data) or approximately constant values (for real-valued data).
Dissimilaritycriteriaensurethatanytriclustersimilartoanothertriclusterwithhigherpriority
is removed from T and possibly used to refine similar triclusters in T. A tricluster T = (I,J,K)
is considered maximal if and only if there is no other tricluster (I’,J’,K’) such that I ⊆ I′∧J ⊆
J′∧K ⊆K′, satisfying the given criteria.
Foremost, statistical significance criteria ensure that the probability of each retrieved tri-
cluster occurring against a null data model is unexpectedly low. Given the probability of the
occurrence of a tricluster pattern, p , binomial tails can be employed to robustly compute the
φT

The discriminative properties of a tricluster pattern φ , along with other interestingness
T
measurements, can be evaluated using association rules [2]. Association rules depict a connection
between two events, defined by a left-hand side (antecedent) and a right-hand side (consequent).
In this context, an association rule may take the form φ → c, where a pattern in the antecedent
T
discriminates an outcome of interest in the consequent. The coverage of the association rule,
Φ(φ → c), is determined by the number of observations where both the pattern φ and the
T T
outcome c co-occur.
3Two established interestingness measures are the confidence, Φ(φ → c)/Φ(φ ), assessing the
T T
probability of c occurring when φ occurs, and the lift, (Φ(φ → c)/(Φ(φ )×Φ(c))×N, which

further considers the probability of the consequent to evaluate the dependence between the con-

to be particularly useful as a complementary measurement. In contrast to the lift measure, the

Triclusteringalgorithmicapproachesbelongtotwomajorcategories: 1)greedyorstochastic,or,
2) (quasi-)exhaustive [20]. Each approach can be further categorized according to the underlying
behavior that it relies on, such as biclustering-based searches, and evolutionary multiobjective op-
timization algorithms, among others. Considering the scalability limits of exhaustive searches, this
work places a focus on greedy-based approaches. Greedy algorithms follow two major approaches:
1) initialize a big pattern and iteratively refine it based on quality criteria until a satisfactory so-
lution is obtained[8], or 2) initialize multiple small patterns and iteratively merge them based on
qualitycriteriauntilamaximumpredefinednumberofiterationsisreached[17]. Thelatterapproach
is usually employed by evolutionary algorithms [27]. Irrespectively of the selected approach, the
extractedpatternswillreflectacoherenttemporalprogressionwithaspecificstructureandquality,
that represent the homogeneity of the pattern. Largely applied triclustering algorithms, including
MOGA3C [23] and δ-Trimax [8], focus on optimizing each pattern with regards to pattern size, or
patternquality(e.g. meansquaredresidualscore[11]). Othersinthefieldhavefocusedtheirefforts
on developing new merit functions or extending already well-established ones to be used in more
complexdatastructures. Kakatietal. [22],implementstheShifting-and-ScalingSimilaritymeasure
(SSSim) [1] in the context of tensor data. Similarly, both Bhar et al. [8] and Guti´errez-Avil´es and
Rubio-Escudero [16], proposed an extension of the mean square residue score (MSR) [11] to be
incorporatedintomeritfunctionsoftriclusteringalgorithms. Guti´errez-Avil´esandRubio-Escudero
[13, 14] proposed two evaluation measures for triclusters, termed Least Squared Lines (LSL) and
Multi Slope Measure (MSL), that focus on the similarity among the angles of the slopes formed by
each profile of a tricluster pattern. Both LSL and MSL are embedded in merit functions employed
by TriGen [17], a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, and its’ extension STriGen [26]. Merit
functions have also been tailored to fit domain-specific problems. Amaro-Mellado et al. [5] ex-
tracted seismic source zones by modifying TriGen merit functions to accommodate the geophysical
indicators. Inthepresenceofgeneexpressiondata, Guti´errez-Avil´esandRubio-Escudero[15], pro-
posed the addition of biological quality to merit functions (functional enrichment of the extracted
regulatory patterns [12]).

Trigen implements a wide variety of objective functions, of which we will focus on MSR, multi-
slope measure (MSL), and least-squared line (LSL). Both LSL and MSL focus on graphical simi-
larity. LSL measures the similitude between the least squares approximation for the points in each
graphic of the three views, described by the following equation:
AC ({I,J,K})+AC ({I,K,J})+AC ({K,I,J})
LSL= lsl lsl lsl , (6)

2 Methodology
The proposed methodology offers principles on how to extend objective functions to accommodate
bothstatisticalsignificance viewsanddiscriminativecriteria withoutcompromisingpatternquality.
To this end, we propose the creation of two components based on well-established interestingness
measures in the presence of annotations [2] - discriminative power component (DPC) - and on
sound statistical tests [3] - statistical significance component (SSC).
Bydefault,DPCincorporatestwomeasures,theliftmeasure,andits’standardizedversion[25],

discriminates outcome C with a lift of 2.16 and standardized lift of 0.5.
wherew andw representuser-definedweights,andnormalizedlift-definedasdesired lift/lift,
d1 d2
if lift > desired lift, and 1 otherwise. By default, both w and w have the same value but
d1 d2
can be adjusted depending on user preferences for finding patterns with a higher discriminative
power (w ) versus maximizing the discriminative power of each pattern (w ). Figure 1 provides
d2 d1
an example of how patterns with the same discriminative power vary in terms of completeness and
vice versa. Additionally, the user can also adjust the minimum lift necessary for a pattern to be
discriminative - given by the desired lift variable. By default, desired lift has a value of 1.2, but
any value above 1.0 already forces the formation of patterns with discriminative properties.
The SSC implements the statistical significance tests proposed by Alexandre et al. [3], but the
use of other significance tests is also supported. A significance threshold (θ) of < 0.05, where we
test the probability of each pattern against a null data model, is set as a standard threshold to
inhibit false positives. Depending on the algorithmic approach (e.g. if we know the number of
patterns before the search), further adjustments to this threshold can be done via the Bonferroni
Correction [19]. To allow for a less abrupt transition when evaluating statistical significance, we
adjust the significance component by scaling the p-values with a logarithmic function. Given the
aforesaid, the SSC is then defined as:
(cid:40)
1 , if p-value<θ
SSC = |log(p-value)| (9)
1, otherwise.
Finally, to embed the proposed components into existing objective functions we consider two
main approaches, one based on addition and one on multiplication. The choice depends on how
we choose to view the composition of components. If we assume that it is linear, addition is a
natural way of capturing that behavior. Additionally, by using addition it is easier to model the
degree to which both the discriminative power and statistical significance components compensate
for pattern quality. Multiplication is suggested to penalize the score of patterns more abruptly.
Contrary to the additive approach, the changes in the values of one of the components produce a
proportional impact on the outcome statistic. With this in mind, we define the modified objective
function (MOF),
(cid:40)
MOF =
β

PQCα1 +β

(DPC×PQC)α2 +β

(SSC×PQC)α3, if additive,
(10)
PQCα1 × DPCα2 × SSCα3, if multiplicative,
6where β and α represent the weights and adjustments of each component. The default
(1−3) (1−3)
value for the β weights is 1 and for the α adjustments is 1/k where k is the number of components.
Further adjustments can be made to better understand the reasoning behind the proposed default
values recall that state-of-the-art algorithms follow one of two approaches, either bottom-up or
top-down. Foralgorithmsthatfollowatop-downapproachwithastrictPQCthreshold,weneedto
considerhowtheincorporationofDPCandSSCmodulesimpactstheimposedthreshold. Therefore,
we explore the behavior of the MOF when a constant PQC value is applied.
Figure 2 illustrates how MOF varies for different DPC values and p-values. We observe that
in both approaches the distribution of values approximately follows a normal distribution, and
as a result, we can examine binomial tails to study stricter and rarer MOF values. In this con-
text, lower values translate into a better pattern solution, as such we concentrate on the right
tail of the binomial distribution marked by the commonly applied boundaries of 5% and 10%.
By filtering out values using slightly stricter criteria for each component, we notice that almost
all possible pattern solutions abiding by the criteria, fall under the 10% right tail. Since the

redefine the original user-inputted pattern quality threshold. The new threshold is then defined
as MOFm, where MOFm is the mth modified objective function value from an ordered array

3 Computational Experimental Setup
In order to assess the effectiveness of the proposed objective function in aiding the discovery of
patterns with discriminative and statistical significance guarantees, we selected two greedy-based
triclustering algorithms. Each algorithm represents one of the two major search approaches. First,
δ-Trimax [9], an iterative search algorithm that follows a top-down approach. For a valid pattern
solution, it imposes a strict MSR threshold that must be satisfied. Second, TriGen [17], a multi-
objectiveevolutionaryalgorithmthatfollowsabottom-upapproach. Itusesafitnessfunctionbased
on pattern quality measures to guide pattern formation.
The modified algorithms are then applied in the context of three publically available datasets:
activity recognition data [28], basketball movements data [6], and sports activies data [7]. Table
1 provides a brief description of each dataset and the applied preprocessing. In the case of the
δ-Trimax algorithm, the imposed MSR threshold is based on the dataset and also on the approach.

total of 20 clusters to be extracted with every other parameter set to their default values.
Finally, we assess pattern solutions returned by both δ-Trimax and Trigen, and their modified
versions, assessing them against each other. We use the t-student test to understand if there is a

to test improvements in similar instances [13, 14]; and (3) discriminative and statistical significant
criteria. Additionally, we provide the outcome distribution between the original algorithms and
their modified versions.

84 Results and Discussion
We hypothesize that the extension of triclustering algorithms, with the proposed modified objec-
tive functions, produce triclustering solutions where patterns exhibit an overall improvement in
both discriminative power and statistical significance against traditional searches solely focused
on homogeneity criteria. In Table 2 we present the results of this analysis for each case study and
methodologicapproach. Eachpatternsolutionisassessedwithregardtotheaveragevolumeofpat-
terns, pattern quality measurements, discriminative power criteria, statistical significance criteria,
variable correlation criteria, and objective function values.
Considering the activity recognition data, we observe an overall improvement of metric values
across all pattern solutions using modified objective functions. Specifically, the additive approach
in the TriGen algorithm revealed significant improvements in the discriminative power and sta-
tistical significance of the returned patterns. The multiplicative approach shows more moderate
improvements,undertheMSTorMLSpatternqualityfunctions. Itneverthelessyieldshighgainsin
variable correlation. Notably, the modified objective functions did not strongly alter pattern qual-
ity. Interestingly, in some instances, the MOF contributed to an increase in the average pattern
quality, as seen in the case of the δ-Trimax algorithm.
Considering the basketball data, the results also show an overall improvement in discriminative
power criteria for Trigen. The multiplicative MOF with TriGen yields consistent gains of discrimi-
nativepower underbothMSRorLSLpatternqualitymeasurements,and,TriGenusinganadditive
approach under the MLS measurement. As with the activity recognition data, gains of variable
correlation were also observed when TriGen used a multiplicative approach with MSR as a pattern
quality measure. Additionally, in both MOF versions of the δ-Trimax algorithm, patterns achieved
their maximum standard lift value but a lower lift value than the original approach. Both MOF
versionsofTriGen,undertheLSLpatternqualitymeasurement,andδ-Trimaxhadsignificantgains
in statistical significance.
Finally,considertheresultsproducedusingthesports data. Weobserveanincreaseofdiscrimi-
nativepower inallMOFversionsoftheTriGenalgorithmversusits’originalapproach. Similarlyto
both activity recognition and basketball data results, results produced by the δ-Trimax algorithm
produced patterns with higher completeness of discriminative power. The MOF multiplicative
approach of TriGen, under the MLS and LSL pattern quality measurement, produced significant
improvements in pattern statistical significance. Similarly, both MOF versions of δ-Trimax also
produced patterns with higher statistical significance.
In addition to the previous analysis, we provide an in-depth view of the discriminative power of
patterns for each dataset. Figure 3 displays three distinct patterns. The first pattern is extracted
fromtheactivity datasetusingtheMOFadditiveversionofTriGen,assessedundertheMSRpattern
quality measurement. The second pattern originates from the basketball dataset, extracted by the
MOF multiplicative version of TriGen, and evaluated under the LSL pattern quality measurement.
Lastly, the third pattern is obtained from the sports dataset using the MOF additive version of δ-
Trimax. Allofthepatternspresentedarefrompatternsolutionswhosepatternexhibitedsignificant
improvementsindiscriminativepower. Wenotethattheactivity datasetpatternonlydiscriminates

likely due to the similarity between tasks.

5 Conclusion
Thisworkproposedanovelapproachforextractingpatternsfromtensordata,ensuringguarantees
of pattern quality, statistical significance, and discriminative power. Firstly, we provided an in-
depth discussion on the challenges faced by different greedy-based approaches and how to tackle
them. Secondly, we provided sound statistical reasoning on how to parameterize threshold-based
greedy approaches to accommodate the proposed modified objective functions. Finally, we showed
the effectiveness of our methodology by testing it in the context of three case studies. Pattern
solutions extracted by the modified versions of the algorithms had significant improvements in
pattern discriminative power, pattern statistical significance, and in some cases, higher pattern
11
eulaV eulaV eulaVquality, against the classic quality-driven solutions produced by the original approaches.
While our methodology reveals notable quantitative and qualitative improvements against the
original approaches, we acknowledge that the importance of each criterion may vary between do-
mains. In this context, the hyperparametization of the integrative scoring function should be con-
sidered. Furthermore, the inclusion of domain relevance as a fourth criteria class can be pursued
toenhance theactionability ofpatterns withoutforgoingthe establishedimprovements. Finally, as
ourmethodologycanbestraightforwardlyextendedtowardsthediscoveryofpatternsinotherdata
structures, a broader assessment of its impact for knowledge acquisition from tabular and N-way
tensor (e.g., N >4) data structures is highlighted for future work.
