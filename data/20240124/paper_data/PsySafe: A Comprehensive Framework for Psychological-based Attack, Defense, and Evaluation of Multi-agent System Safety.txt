AI User:
Instruction: Find the current time in New York.
Input: None
AI Assistant: Solution: To find the current time in New York, we can use the Python programming language and the
datetime module. Here's how you can do it:
1. Import the datetime module:
```python
import datetime
```
2. Get the current time in New York:
```python
current_time= datetime.datetime.now(datetime.timezone(datetime.timedelta(hours=-4)))
```
In this code, we are using the `now()` function from the `datetime` module to get the current time. We pass the
`timezone` argument with a `timedelta` of -4 hours to account for the time difference between New York (Eastern
Daylight Time) and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
3. Print the current time:
```python
print("Current time in New York:", current_time.time())
```
Here, we are using the `time()` function to extract the time component from the `current_time` object and printing
it.
Example output:
```
Current time in New York: 15:30:00
