Market Responses to Genuine Versus Strategic Generosity:
An Empirical Examination of NFT Charity Fundraisers
Chen Liang1, Murat Tunc2, Gordon Burtch3
Abstract
Crypto donations now represent a significant fraction of charitable giving worldwide. Nonfungible token
(NFT) charity fundraisers, which involve the sale of NFTs of artistic works with the proceeds donated to
philanthropic causes, have emerged as a novel development in this space. A unique aspect of NFT charity
fundraisers is the significant potential for donors to reap financial gains from the rising value of purchased
NFTs. Questions may arise about the motivations of donors in these charity fundraisers, resulting in a
negative social image. NFT charity fundraisers thus offer a unique opportunity to understand the economic
consequences of a donor’s social image. We investigate these effects in the context of a large NFT charity
fundraiser. We identify the causal effect of purchasing an NFT within the charity fundraiser on a donor’s
later market outcomes by leveraging random variation in transaction processing times on the blockchain.
Further, we demonstrate a clear pattern of heterogeneity, based on an individual’s decision to relist (versus
hold) the purchased charity NFTs (a sign of strategic generosity), and based on an individual’s degree of
social exposure within the NFT marketplace. We show that charity-NFT ‘relisters’ experience significant
penalties in the market, in terms of the prices they are able to command on other NFT listings, particularly
among those who relist quickly and those who are more socially exposed. Our study underscores the
growing importance of digital visibility and traceability, features that characterize crypto-philanthropy, and
online philanthropy more broadly.

11. Introduction
Blockchain technologies, and cryptocurrency in particular, have had a disruptive influence on financial
markets over the past 15 years. This disruption has recently extended to philanthropy (Tan and Tan 2022);
crypto donations now comprise a substantial fraction of charitable donations around the world. Many of the
world’s best-known charitable organizations now accept cryptocurrency donations, including the American
Red Cross, Khan Academy, Oxfam, UNICEF, and the YMCA. According to Fidelity Charitable, the non-
profit arm of Fidelity, nearly half of all cryptocurrency investors make charitable donations,4 and Fidelity
itself received $331 million in cryptocurrency donations in 2021 alone, a 10-fold increase over the year
prior.5
Within the broader crypto philanthropy space, charity fundraisers involving artistic work minted as
non-fungible tokens, or NFTs (Kanellopoulos et al. 2021), have recently gained prevalence.6 A number of
NFT charity fundraisers have seen massive success over the last few years, organized by the likes of Bill
Murray,7 Sotheby’s,8 and Taco Bell.9 Several online platforms have even emerged that cater specifically to
the phenomenon, e.g., DoinGud10 and DigitalArt4Climate.11
NFT fundraisers are organized in support of a particular philanthropic organization or pursuit. Each
fundraiser focuses on artwork that is commissioned or contributed for sale to ‘donors,’ such that the
resulting proceeds can be provided to the beneficiary organization. A unique aspect of these fundraisers,
and crypto philanthropy more broadly, is that donors have the potential to benefit financially from their
ostensibly prosocial ‘donations’ (Tan and Tan 2022). For example, in an NFT charity fundraiser, an
individual may reap financial gains because the NFTs they purchase and the underlying cryptocurrencies

2to which they are tied can experience rapid increases in value. This dynamic implies that, although
individuals may be motivated by altruism, they may also be driven by the prospect of personal gain.
Depending on the inferences onlookers make about an individual’s motivations for purchasing an NFT,
positive or negative consequences may arise for that individual’s social image.
Extensive research in economics and psychology has documented evidence that image concerns
shape a variety of behaviors (Bursztyn & Jensen 2017), including numerous prosocial activities, such as
volunteering (Carpenter and Myers 2010), blood donation (Lacetera and Macis 2010), and charitable
contributions (Bénabou and Tirole 2006; Kafashan et al. 2014; Simpson and Willer 2015). Work argues
and shows that individuals are more likely to engage in prosocial behavior when their social image will
benefit from doing so (Lacetera and Macis 2010). Conversely, work also shows that individuals are less
likely to engage in prosocial behavior when potential benefits are absent or undermined by the publicly
observable presence of extrinsic incentives, e.g., financial compensation (Bénabou and Tirole 2006).
While a great deal of research has explored how image concerns can affect individuals’ tendencies
to engage in prosocial behavior, little work has examined the perspective and perception of onlookers
(Berman and Silver 2022). That is, little work has formally examined whether and to what extent individuals
experience economic benefits or penalties as a consequence of accruing positive or negative social image,
such as that arising from onlookers’ perception that an individual is generous, or that their appearance of
generosity is in fact strategic. We address that gap here in the context of a large NFT charity fundraiser,
employing data from a fundraiser organized in support of Ukraine amid its military conflict with Russia.
We collect and analyze a dataset from an NFT marketplace spanning the 14 months surrounding the
fundraiser, which took place on February 26, 2022.
More specifically, we examine NFT-listing and sale activities associated with a group of
individuals who attempted to purchase an NFT offered as part of the Ukraine fundraiser. We contrast the
market activities and outcomes of those who successfully obtained an NFT (our treated, ‘generous’ group)
with those who failed (our control group). To obtain causal estimates, our research design exploits plausibly
exogenous variation in NFT purchases arising from uncontrollable delays in transaction processing on the
3blockchain. These uncontrollable delays led some interested individuals to ultimately fail in their attempt
to purchase an NFT, while others succeeded, because the fundraiser offered only a limited number of NFTs
for sale. Conditional on bid timing and bid gas limit, we can causally identify the effect of purchasing a
charity NFT (i.e., exhibiting generosity) on an individual’s later market experiences.
We first demonstrate that purchasing a charity NFT has a significant negative association with later
market outcomes, on average. Next, exploring heterogeneity in those effects depending on whether an
individual’s initial generosity is eventually revealed to be strategic; that is, depending on whether an
individual held versus re-listed their charity NFTs, we demonstrate that the average effect is driven
primarily by individuals who relisted their charity NFT. That is, while individuals who held their charity
NFTs experience a slight benefit in the market, strategically generous individuals experienced a large,
systematic penalty in terms of the prices they were able to command for the other NFTs in their portfolio
(an approximate 6.29% decline). Further, these effects are shown to be stronger for individuals whose
strategic behavior is observable to a larger audience, i.e., individuals who have more followers in the
marketplace. These results are shown to be robust to a variety of specifications and matching techniques,
alternative estimation strategies (instrumental variable regression and matrix completion), and a set of
placebo tests.
Our study contributes to the literature on social image and pro-social contribution, as well as the
literature on crypto philanthropy. Our work offers unique insights into the dynamics of social penalties and
ostracism that arise in response to perceived strategic generosity. As recent work observes, field evidence
for the role of social image in prosocial contributions is generally hard to come by, which has resulted in a
heavy focus upon laboratory experiments in the literature (Exley 2018). NFT charity fundraisers provide a
research context that uniquely lends itself to the study of social image, in large part because all transactions,
involved parties, and associated prices, are publicly observable, auditable, and traceable on the blockchain
via smart contracts (Cong et al. 2023).
Our study also contributes to the broader literature on the role of social image concerns in prosocial
behavior, particularly in the context of charitable giving and donation. The findings demonstrate the extent
4to which the negative social consequences that donors experience may also translate to negative economic
consequences as well. Our work also contributes to the nascent literature on crypto philanthropy. In short,
we highlight the influence of an important feature of NFTs and blockchain, namely the public visibility and
traceability of transactions, in this new context of charitable giving.
Finally, in terms of practical implications, our findings suggest that donors to NFT charity
fundraisers may face positive or negative economic consequences in terms of the prices for their NFTs in
subsequent transactions, depending on the motivational attributions that onlookers make. This finding has
implications for the behavior and participation of potential donors and may have implications for the long-
run success of NFT charity fundraisers. To the extent donors recognize and experience economic gains or
penalties, their participation may rise or decline in the long run. Further, to the extent strategic generosity
is penalized in these markets, individuals may begin to behave systematically less strategically than in other,
less transparent contexts. Our study also highlights the importance of considering the role of social image
concerns in charitable giving, not only from a donor’s standpoint, but also from the perspective of third-
party onlookers. While donors may be motivated by both altruistic and strategic considerations, and
concerns about third-party perceptions may influence their choices about whether and how much to
contribute, our work demonstrates that onlookers’ actual perceptions are also important to consider, and
that donors may benefit from managing those perceptions.
2. Literature Review
2.1. Image Concerns & Prosocial Behavior
The literature concerning the impact of social image on prosocial behavior offers a nuanced view of how
individuals’ actions are shaped by the prospect of social recognition and material rewards. The research by
Lacetera and Macis (2010) sheds light on the intricacies of blood donation, highlighting how symbolic
prizes can enhance donation activity by serving as markers of positive social recognition, especially when
these acknowledgments are made public. Conversely, Carpenter and Myers (2010) highlight that the benefit
of making incentives publicly observable appears to invert when those incentives are monetary in nature.
5Those authors leverage data on volunteer firefighters to show that, while monetary incentives do motivate
greater participation among these firefighters, their efficacy diminishes when the incentives are made public,
as the firefighters are aware that the mere presence of publicly observable financial incentives undermines
the social image benefit that a volunteer obtains from their volunteering, by shifting onlookers’ perceptions
of the volunteer’s motives. Bénabou and Tirole (2006) provide a theoretical framework that formalizes the
interplay between altruism, material incentives, transparency, and social image. Consistent with the noted
empirical findings, their model predicts that material or reputational incentives can lead to a reduction, or
even a complete displacement, of intrinsic prosocial motivations.
Recently, this literature has shifted toward understanding how third-party observers perceive and
judge an individual’s prosocial actions. For example, Berman et al. (2015) explore the consequences of
boasting about one’s prosocial activities. Those authors demonstrate that bragging in this manner can
enhance an individual’s perceived generosity if the highlighted activities were not previously known to the
individual’s audience. However, boasting can have a negative consequence if the highlighted activities were
already common knowledge. Further, Bliege Bird et al. (2018) show that engaging in observable prosocial
actions can help attract new transaction partners in a marketplace, due to reputational gains. That said,
Berman and Silver (2022) observe, as part of a broader discussion, that prosocial acts may engender greater
skepticism from onlookers in competitive contexts, if onlookers perceive that the ostensibly prosocial
activities are in fact strategic, intended to foster trust or more favorable evaluations.
The findings and discussion highlighted recently in this literature are particularly relevant in online
philanthropy and online trade, e.g., crowdfunding platforms and NFT marketplaces. In these settings charity
and financial compensation are broadly observable to all participants in the marketplace, due to the
transparent nature of the blockchain. Strategic displays of generosity are thus very likely to influence
individuals’ ability to transact in the marketplace (Bliege Bird et al. 2018). That said, these effects may also
fail to manifest, as prior work notes the importance of prevailing norms in a marketplace or community
6(Berman and Silver 2022). To the extent that a strategic behavior is common, e.g., reselling NFTs, it might
be perceived as acceptable and thus uninformative about an individual’s social character.
2.2. Crypto Philanthropy & NFT Charity Fundraisers
Cryptocurrencies have disrupted financial markets broadly (Catalini et al. 2022), and the market for
philanthropy is no exception (Tan and Tan 2022). The proportion of charitable donations now made in
cryptocurrency has been on the rise, globally, exhibiting a ten-fold increase between 2020 and 2021
according to Fidelity Charitable,12 and recent estimates indicate that 10% of the US adult population now
holds some form of cryptocurrency.13
NFTs, or Non-Fungible Tokens, are digital assets stored on a blockchain, a decentralized and
distributed digital ledger technology. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, NFTs are unique (hence the term
‘non-fungible’), with each NFT tied to a particular asset, whether physical, e.g., real estate, or digital, e.g.,
artistic images, videos, or audio clips. The ownership of an NFT is recorded on the blockchain, which
provides proof of ownership and ensures that the asset is unique and cannot be duplicated or altered. This
makes NFTs attractive for creators of digital art, collectibles, and other unique digital items who want to
protect the authenticity and value of their creations. NFTs are bought and sold on digital marketplaces, e.g.,
OpenSea, with the value of each NFT being determined by supply and demand. As with any market, the
value of NFTs can fluctuate depending on a variety of factors such as popularity, rarity, and perceived value.
While NFTs have been around for several years, they have gained significant attention and popularity of
late due to several high-profile sales of NFT-based digital art, reaching millions of dollars.
A small literature in IS has begun to examine aspects of NFTs, and their implications for traditional
markets. For example, Hallaburda et al (2022) conceptually discuss the nature of NFTs, the novel
functionalities they afford, and new types of markets they may enable, while Kanellopoulos et al. (2021)
examine the effect of the introduction of NFT collectibles on the demand for traditional collectibles in the

7context of basketball trading cards. However, by far, NFTs’ greatest area of adoption to date has been in
the realm of art (Kugler 2021). Many NFT markets have begun to host auction fundraisers to support
charitable causes. Several dedicated platforms have even emerged that are tailored to this purpose. In these
charity fundraisers, a limited supply of NFT artwork is first contributed (minted) by artists, and then sold,
with all or a portion of the proceeds being allocated toward a philanthropic organization.
Philanthropy involving NFTs provides an interesting context for the study of social image. While
there is a small prior literature on charity-fundraisers (Carpenter et al. 2008; 2010; Elfenbein and McManus
2010; Leszczyc and Rothkopf 2010), addressing why people participate, the efficacy of different fundraiser
formats, and showing that individuals are willing to pay more for the same item when their payment is
linked to charity, the prior literature has focused little on the role of financial returns to donors, or on the
perception of said by third parties. This is likely because donors’ financial benefits, to the extent they do
exist, are only likely to manifest over the long term, and are generally not visible to onlookers. NFT charity
fundraisers are different, of course, because there is a significant potential for short-run financial gains, due
to the highly speculative, volatile nature of NFT value (Zaucha and Agur 2022), and because the role of the
blockchain makes resale and subsequent transactions highly visible to others in the market. Transparency
and visibility can increase trust between donors and onlookers (Weiss and Obermeier, 2021) or expose self-
interested giving and suspicious activities (Chao and Fisher, 2022; Tahmasbi and Fuchsberger, 2022). In
turn, this creates the potential for social image to significantly influence an ostensibly prosocial donor’s
ability to conduct future transactions in the marketplace.
3. Study Context and Data
Our study utilizes a dataset of NFT transactions linked to individuals (unique wallets) who attempted to
purchase NFTs offered as part of a charity fundraiser aimed at supporting Ukraine in its conflict with Russia.
We collected this data via two APIs: the Etherscan API, which provides bid information, and the Rarible
API, which provides data on individuals’ other NFT-related activities across various NFT marketplaces.
We constructed a panel dataset spanning 14 months, from August 2021 to September 2022. Our panel thus
8includes seven months before and after the date of the NFT charity fundraiser, February 26, 2022.14 Our
sample includes 2,836 individuals who successfully purchased a charity NFT, and 2,856 individuals who
tried and failed.15 Table 1 provides detailed definitions alongside the descriptive statistics for each variable
in our data.

Note: We add the value of 1 to all continuous variables related to NFT listings and sales prior to performing the log
transformation. When measuring individuals’ behavior concerning NFT listings and sales, we exclude any activities
pertaining to the charity NFTs under study.
Our analysis focuses on the RELI3F UKR NFT collection,16 which includes 200 units (each) of 37
NFTs, provided by 37 influential artists. All 7,400 copies of these NFTs were sold within 5 minutes (see
Figure 1), and all proceeds from the initial sale of each NFT went to support humanitarian relief efforts in
Ukraine. The individuals who were able to acquire one of these NFTs when they were first auctioned off,
on February 26, 2022, serve as our treatment group. Our control group consists of those individuals who
attempted to acquire one of the NFTs, yet were unable to do so due to i) the limited number of units on
offer, and ii) random variation in transaction processing times on the blockchain. This aspect of our research
design thus benefits from the unique transparency of the blockchain (Li et al. 2024), which documents all
14 We take the treatment date to be February 26, 2022, the date when the NFT charity fundraiser started and ended; all
7,400 NFTs were sold within 5 minutes of release on that date.
15 Some individuals may submit multiple bids and can be unsuccessful in some of their attempts, yet successful in
others. Further, some individuals may initially fail to acquire an NFT, yet manage to obtain one later, via the secondary
market, i.e., purchasing an NFT from an individual who obtained the NFT as part of the original fundraiser. We omit
these individuals from our sample to ensure mutual exclusivity between those who did versus did not obtain an NFT
as part of the charity fundraiser.

9bids and purchase attempts, even those that fail to complete.
Figure 1. Timeline of the RELI3F UKR NFT Charity Fundraiser
To identify strategically generous donors, we explore heterogeneity in the behavior of NFT-
acquiring individuals following the initial purchase. While some individuals retained their charity NFTs,
others listed them for resale. Relisting and reselling a charity NFT is publicly observable (see Figure 2) and
quite likely to be taken as a sign by others that the individual’s initial purchase was strategic and self-
interested.17 With this idea in mind, we contrast subsequent market outcomes between individuals who held
. .
versus relisted their charity NFT.
17 Anecdotal evidence indicates a general public backlash against the speculative practice of profiting from charity
NFTs. There is a prevailing sentiment that seeking profit by purchasing charity NFTs is “unethical” (source:
https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7nk87/ukraine-canceled-crypto-airdrop-because-unethical-investors-wanted-
profit), accompanied by the belief that “donors should not be repaid” (source:
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ukraine-cancels-crypto-airdrop-promises-200239232.html).

4. Methods
4.1. Research Design
To establish the causal effect of purchasing a charity NFT on market outcomes related to the other NFTs in
an individual’s portfolio, we would ideally randomize individuals to purchase events. However, such an
experiment is obviously infeasible for several reasons. However, we can employ an alternative design that
closely approximates random assignment, leveraging quasi-random variation in blockchain transaction
processing times conditional on purchase attempts initiated at the same point in time, using the same gas
limit. Given that all charity NFTs were sold at the same price within 5 minutes of one another,18 small
variations in transaction processing time had a large impact on whether individuals’ purchase attempts were
completed successfully. Accordingly, we can divide individuals who attempted to purchase charity NFTs
into two groups: one composed of individuals who successfully acquired the charity NFTs and one
composed of individuals who attempted yet failed, due to stock-out. Leveraging these two groups, we
estimate a difference-in-differences (DID) design (Angrist and Pischke 2008; Burtch et al. 2018) to recover
the effect of successful donation (charity NFT purchase) on the sales performance of other NFTs in an
affected individual’s portfolio. Subsequently, we estimate moderated DID specifications, to understand
heterogeneity in the effects depending on whether an individual relists the NFT for sale, or holds it, as well
as heterogeneity in other characteristics, e.g., the extent of an individual’s social exposure in the
marketplace. In the next section, we elaborate on our matching strategy.
4.2. Matching
To further ensure comparability between the two groups, we use coarsened exact matching (CEM)
(Blackwell et al. 2009), constructing a matched sample based on the timing of their purchase attempt,19 the

11gas limit associated with their transaction, and their NFT-related activities (i.e., purchases, sales, mints,
listings, and transfers) prior to the treatment (i.e., start of the NFT charity fundraiser). The CEM method
allows us to match both groups based on the time at which they submit their request to purchase charity
NFTs, the level of the gas limit20 (whether it is higher than, equal to, or lower than the modal gas limit),
and their NFT-related activities (i.e., purchases, sales, mints, listings, and transfers) prior to the focal NFT
charity fundraiser. As Table 2 shows, all the covariates exhibit high comparability between the treatment
and control groups after matching. The CEM procedure yields a sample of 720 individuals in the control
group that closely mirror the characteristics of 854 individuals in the treatment group, for a total sample of
1,574 individuals.

Note: In the full sample, 43.10% of individuals have a gas limit of 122,839, which appears to be the prevailing
default value. In the matching process, we categorize individuals into three distinct groups: LowGas, ModeGas, and
HighGas. This classification is contingent upon whether their designated gas limits fall below, align with, or exceed
the default benchmark.
Our main analysis leverages this matched sample. That said, our robustness checks later
demonstrate that our results are highly consistent when our sample is further restricted based on a shorter
window of purchase requests, three minutes before and after the point of charity NFTs stock-out. Further,
20 In Ethereum, the time it takes to complete the transaction can be anywhere between 15 seconds and 5 minutes and
depends on various factors (e.g., the gas limit, the congestion of the Ethereum network) (see more on
https://legacy.ethgasstation.info/blog/ethereum-transaction-how-long/). As such, individuals have the option to
increase the likelihood of a successful purchase by submitting their bids earlier (if possible) and increasing the gas
limit. Usually, the Ethereum-based platform will provide the recommended default gas limit, but individuals can
specify a gas limit higher or lower than the default one depending on their willingness to pay for the charity NFT.
12our results hold when applying CEM to that subsample, based on the same set of matching covariates, and
when employing an alternative matching approach to the broader sample, namely Propensity Score
Matching (PSM). All the findings remain remarkably consistent when we employ the alternative matching
sample with a 3-minute window, the alternative matched sample derived from PSM, or the full sample.

Having established the average effects of displayed generosity, we next turn our attention to the
distinction between ‘pure’ and apparently ‘strategic’ generosity, as reflected by an individual’s decision to
hold versus re-list the NFT for re-sale, respectively. We achieve this by estimating a series of moderated
DID specifications, introducing interactions with measures reflecting whether the charity NFT is relisted
for sale, how quickly it is relisted for sale, and the degree of social exposure an individual faces in the NFT
community. We then conclude by reporting a variety of additional robustness checks.
5. Results
5.1. Main Results: Average Treatment Effect (ATE)
We begin by estimating the effect of the charity NFT acquisition on individuals’ NFT sales performance.
Considering Table 3, we find that charity NFT purchase has no significant impact on an individual’s volume
of NFT sales. However, it does have a significant negative impact on an individual’s NFT sale price
(approximately -6.29%). 24 This finding suggests that charity NFT purchase adversely influences
individuals’ subsequent NFT sales performance, on average, lowering the price an individual is able to
command in the NFT market. While this result is superficially surprising, in subsequent sections, we
demonstrate that this average negative effect is driven by the adverse outcomes experienced by purchasers
who eventually relisted the charity NFT for sale.
24 Based on the coefficient estimated in Model 4 of Table 3, 1- exp(-0.065) = 6.29%.

To assess the parallel trend assumption, we replace the treatment indicator with dummies reflecting
chronological distance in months from the time of charity NFT purchase (Autor 2003; Angrist and Pischke
2008; Burtch et al. 2018). Specifically, we replace the treatment dummy, in Equation (1) with a
set of relative time dummies as follows:

purchase ( ). Following prior literature (e.g., Autor 2003; Burtch et al. 2018), we designate the
relative mo𝜋𝜋n∈th [(−-17), 7as] the omitted reference period, and the dummies are all coded as 0 for observations
associated with control individuals. The coefficients that we estimate associated with pre-treatment
dummies are not expected to differ from zero; were they to deviate from zero, this would reflect a violation
of the parallel trend assumption. That said, we do expect coefficients associated with post treatment
dummies to deviate from zero, as these dummies capture changes in the treatment group, post treatment.
The post-treatment relative time dummies thus allow us to investigate how the treatment effect evolves over
time.
We report the results of this estimation in Table 4 and we visualize the coefficients in Figure 3. As
Table 4 and Figure 3 show, all the pre-treatment relative time coefficients are not significantly different
15from zero, consistent with the parallel trend assumption. While we do observe a negative effect of charity
NFT purchase on an individual’s subsequent volume of NFT sales, the effect is transient. By contrast, the
negative impact on sale prices persists, remaining statistically significant for at least seven months post-
treatment.

5.2. Pure vs. Strategic Generosity: Heterogeneous Treatment Effects (HTE)
To gain a deeper understanding of why charity NFT purchase has a negative impact on individuals’
subsequent NFT sales performance, on average, we next examine how the treatment effect varies depending
on whether the purchasing individual seeks to resell or hold the charity NFT. We incorporate a moderator
variable, , denoting whether an individual lists the charity NFT for resale within
three day𝐿𝐿s 𝑖𝑖f𝐿𝐿o𝑇𝑇l𝐿𝐿loℎw𝑇𝑇i𝑇𝑇n𝑖𝑖g𝑇𝑇𝑎𝑎 i𝑎𝑎ts𝑎𝑎 a𝑇𝑇c3qu𝐷𝐷i𝑇𝑇si𝑎𝑎ti𝐿𝐿o𝑖𝑖 n. Our decision to focus on a 3-day window is driven by the fact that,
among individuals who opted to list their charity NFTs for resale, the vast majority (93.2%) did so within
three days. Note that we later show our results to be robust to this choice; our findings are consistent when
employing an alternative measure, , reflecting whether an individual has ever listed the
charity NFT for resale over the exte𝐿𝐿n𝑖𝑖t𝐿𝐿 o𝑇𝑇𝐿𝐿f oℎu𝑇𝑇r𝑇𝑇 o𝑖𝑖𝑇𝑇b𝑎𝑎s𝑎𝑎er𝑎𝑎v𝑇𝑇a𝑖𝑖 tion period.
As shown in Table 5, we find that individuals are only negatively affected by the charity NFT
purchase if they also sought to resell it. Further, in our final two columns, we see that the purchase of a
charity NFT without an attempt to resell even translates to positive sales outcomes. These results are
consistent with the role of social image and the notion of market punishment of strategic generosity. In
Section 6, we further explore the nuance of these effects, reporting additional heterogeneity analyses that
seek to tease out mechanisms and to validate the role of social image and market punishment.

6. Secondary Analyses
We next report a set of analyses that seek to further support the role of market punishment of strategic
generosity in our above findings. First, we replace our moderated treatment specification with a vector of
treatment dummies that reflect individuals’ progression through three states: charity NFT purchase, charity
NFT relisting, and finally charity NFT resale. Second, we explore additional heterogeneity, considering
variation in the impact of various treatment statuses depending on an individual’s extent of social exposure.
The logic of this test is that the negative effect of relisting a charity NFT should be stronger in the presence
of greater public awareness if the effect is truly driven by a loss of social image. To test this, we introduce
another moderating factor, capturing the size of an individual’s follower base.
Third, we rule out the possibility that changes in sale prices are attributable to shifts in listing
behavior. To do so, we undertake two analyses: i) we repeat our estimations limiting our analysis to other
NFTs that individuals had listed prior to the NFT charity fundraiser and which they had not modified, and
ii) we re-estimate our models conditioning on the volume of NFTs an individual had listed in a given month,
as well as listing prices. Finally, we report the results of a different estimation strategy, namely a listing-
18level survival analysis that demonstrates that strategic generosity increases the time it takes for an individual
to sell other NFTs in their portfolio.
6.1. Progressive Treatment Status
We construct three time-varying treatment status indicators that capture individuals’ behavior around a
purchased charity NFT—specifically, whether they have procured the NFT ( ),
whether they have subsequently listed the charity NFT for resale ( 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑎𝑎𝑇𝑇𝐿𝐿ℎ𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖𝑇𝑇𝑎𝑎𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖𝐿𝐿𝑇𝑇)𝑖𝑖,𝑇𝑇 a𝑔𝑔nd
whether they have successfully resold the charity NFT ( 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝐿𝐿ℎ𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖𝑇𝑇)𝑎𝑎.2𝐿𝐿5𝑖𝑖 𝐿𝐿T𝑇𝑇a𝑖𝑖k𝑇𝑇i𝑔𝑔n𝑎𝑎g 𝑇𝑇o𝑎𝑎u𝑇𝑇r 𝑎𝑎𝑇𝑇control

status. Our expectation is that, if market punishment of strategic generosity is truly driving our results, the
negative effect on individuals’ NFT sale prices should become more pronounced at the point of charity
NFT relisting and resale.
Our results, reported in Table 6, support this expectation. The coefficient of
is positive in most models and becomes statistically significant when

NFT purchases, absent indications of strategic generosity, have no adverse effects on purchasers’ NFT sales
performance. In contrast, the coefficients of and

25 There are a few cases in which individuals sold charity NFTs through accepting buyer-initiated bids before listing
them for resale on the market. However, this behavior was observed in a minor fraction of the cases (precisely
5.88% of all individuals who sold their charity NFTs). Due to the infrequency of this behavior, for analytical
simplicity, we designate both scenarios—whether individuals relisted and then resold the charity NFTs or resold
them without relisting—as the treatment status .

6.2. Social Exposure
We now investigate whether the effect varies with an individual’s level of social exposure, i.e., awareness
within the NFT community. Considering the size of an individual’s follower base as a proxy for social
exposure, we evaluate the extent to which the impacts of the three previously discussed treatment statuses
vary with increases in an individual’s social exposure. The results of this estimation are reported in Table
7. For clarity in interpretation, we demean the follower base measure ( ). We find that
the negative effect of strategic generosity is more pronounced for ind𝑎𝑎i𝑇𝑇v𝐷𝐷id𝑇𝑇ua𝑎𝑎l𝑇𝑇s 𝑎𝑎w𝑎𝑎𝑇𝑇h𝑙𝑙o 𝑇𝑇h𝑇𝑇a𝐿𝐿v𝐿𝐿e𝑇𝑇 a𝑇𝑇 larger follower

6.3. Ruling Out Individuals’ NFT Listing Behavior as an Alternative Explanation
A possible alternative explanation for our results is that treated individuals may change their propensity to
list non-charity NFTs for sale, or they may change their listing prices. To address this possibility, we
perform two additional analyses. First, we repeat our estimations focusing strictly on other NFTs that an
individual had listed and not modified prior to the NFT charity fundraiser. The results of this analysis are
reported in Table 8. We consistently find that a negative treatment effect only arose for individuals who
purchased a charity NFT and sought to resell it; that is, individuals who purchased yet refrained from
relisting the charity NFT benefited from its purchase.

Second, we re-estimate our regressions conditioning on the volume of NFTs an individual had listed
in a given month, as well as their listing prices. Our findings, reported in Table 9, suggest that the negative
treatment effect persists, ruling out individuals’ listing behavior as an explanation for our findings.

6.4. Survival Analysis
Finally, we consider an alternative estimation approach. Specifically, we employ a listing-level
specification, estimating a Cox proportional hazard model (Cox model thereafter) (Cox 1972) that models
the hazard of other NFTs being sold as a function of the individual engaging in behavior reflective of
strategic generosity. We specify our hazard function, at time as follows:
𝜆𝜆𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖(𝑇𝑇), 𝑇𝑇
(3)
𝜆𝜆𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖(𝑇𝑇) = 𝜆𝜆0(𝑇𝑇)∙𝑇𝑇𝑒𝑒𝑇𝑇�𝛽𝛽∙𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 +𝜇𝜇∙𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑎𝑎𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖�
where is the nonparametric baseline hazard rate at a given point in time, . In Equation (3), indexes

are once again attributable only to changes in the demand for an individual’s listed NFTs, not changes in
an individual’s listing behavior.

7. Robustness Checks
Having established the effects of interest, we next implement an extensive set of robustness checks to
support the validity of our findings. First, we assess whether our findings are robust to alternative sample
configurations, we employ both the DID estimation and the relative time model across two distinct samples:
the full sample, and a narrowly defined matched sample concentrating on individuals who attempted to
purchase charity NFTs within a tight three-minute bandwidth surrounding the stock-out timestamp. Second,
as a pivot from the CEM approach, we adopt the PSM method to match individuals in the treatment and
control groups. Third, instead of relying on the parallel trend assumption, which underpins the DID
estimation, we pivot our identification strategy towards an alternative causal inference mechanism: the
Instrumental Variable (IV) analysis. Fourth, to address potential spurious causality concerns, we conduct a
placebo test featuring randomized treatment assignments. This helps gauge the likelihood of our results
being driven by random disturbances rather than the primary treatment (i.e., the charity NFT purchase).
23Fifth, we employ the Matrix Completion (MC) estimator as an alternate causal inference strategy, imputing
counterfactual outcomes for treated observations, and subsequently recovering an average treatment effect
on the treated (ATT). Finally, we consider an alternative time window for our estimations. These analyses
yield remarkably consistent results.
7.1. Alternative Samples
In a pursuit to validate the robustness of our findings, we conduct a similar DID analysis on the full sample.
As delineated in Table 11, the results reveal a significant negative treatment effect on individuals’ NFT
sales performance. Furthermore, to bolster the credibility of our results, we refined our sample to
individuals who placed their donation (i.e., charity NFT purchase) requests within a tight three-minute
bandwidth surrounding the stock-out timestamp. Subsequently, we match individuals who successfully
procured charity NFTs with their counterparts who were unsuccessful, grounding our match on the same
set of covariates elaborated in Section 4.2. The results from our balance check, presented in Appendix A,
indicate no significant differences between these two groups across all individual-specific covariates. The
DID estimations derived from this more stringent matched sample are elucidated in Table 12. These results
remarkably mirror our main findings. Moreover, we employ the relative time model across these two
alternative samples. This analysis consistently reveals an absence of pre-treatment trends, with only a few
instances of marginal significance observed in the sale count model for the full sample. Comprehensive
results are delineated in Figures A1-A2 and Table A2, located in Appendix A.

7.2. Alternative Matching Method
To enhance the credibility of our results, we conduct another robustness check by utilizing an alternative
matching method, namely, PSM (Rosenbaum and Rubin 1983; Liu et al. 2023). The balance checks for this
method suggest that the treatment and control groups are highly comparable. Detailed results pertaining to
the balance checks can be found in Appendix B. The findings based on the PSM sample, presented in Table
13, indicate that all results are consistent with our main findings.

257.3. Instrumental Variable (IV)
We can also exploit the random variation in transaction processing times to employ a different research
design and estimation approach, namely instrumental variable regression. In our matched sample,
individuals in both the treatment and control groups submitted their purchase requests at a similar time and
set the gas limit at the same level. However, the small differences in the processing time of these similar
bids, which are beyond the individuals’ control, may play a crucial role in determining whether their bids
for charity NFTs were confirmed before such NFTs sold out. Thus, we use the log-transformed processing
time as an instrument for the treatment group dummy and use its interaction with the After dummy (which
is set to 1 after the NFT charity fundraiser) as an instrument for the Treated dummy (Wooldridge 2010,
p.154) to estimate the impact of successfully purchasing a charity NFT on the sale prices of other NFTs in
the individuals’ portfolios.
Results appear in Table 14. In the first stage IV regression, we find strong evidence of the instrument’s
relevance. The interaction between the log-transformed processing time and the After dummy, i.e., the
instrument, is significantly negatively correlated with the Treated dummy (coefficient = -0.304, p-value =
0.000). This aligns with our expectation that the longer the processing time for a charity NFT purchase
request, the lower the likelihood of an individual successfully acquiring an NFT (being treated). Further,
the Kleibergen-Paap rk Wald F statistic exceeds the critical values of the Stock-Yogo weak instrument test
(Stock-Yogo 2005), providing additional evidence against the presence of a weak instrument problem. The
results of the second stage are consist with our main results again; the treatment leads to a statistically
significant negative impact on other NFTs’ sales prices.

7.4. Placebo Test
Following prior literature (Abadie et al. 2015, Burtch et al. 2018), we next conduct a placebo test wherein
the treatment indicator is randomly shuffled throughout the sample, repeatedly, and the regression re-
estimated. If the observed treatment effect of charity NFT purchase is driven by a spurious relationship,
then a similar treatment effect should be recovered. We repeat this process 1,000 times and recover the
distribution of placebo treatment effects. Our findings are reported in Table 15. The results indicate that the
no significant relationship between the shuffled treatment and NFT sales outcomes. Moreover, utilizing the
permuted placebo effects to calculate an empirical p-value for our true effect (i.e., randomization inference
approach), we find that the observed negative impact of charity NFT purchase is again highly significant,
and unlikely to be a chance association.

7.5. Matrix Completion (MC)
Drawing from the computer science literature, Athey et al. (2021) propose the MC method, specifically
designed to enable researchers to compute the average treatment on the treated (ATT). This innovative
approach imputes the missing potential outcomes for treated observations by leveraging observed elements
27of the control outcomes matrix associated with untreated observations (Athey et al. 2021). Notably, akin to
the IV approach, the MC eschews dependence on the parallel trend assumption for identification. In our
study, we employ the MC method on the CEM sample. The dynamic treatment effects, as determined by
the MC method, are delineated in Figure 4. A close examination of Figure 4 reveals that all the MC
estimates are approximately zero prior to the treatment. However, post-treatment estimates exhibit a
pronounced negative trajectory, particularly with respect to our focal variable, the aggregate sale price. This
observation provides additional support for our main findings.

Notes: Both plots presented were produced utilizing the “fect” package in Stata. In our analysis, we allowed Stata to
autonomously discern the optimal methodology from the Interactive Fixed Effects (IFE) model and the MC method
by evaluating out-of-sample prediction performance. For both dependent variables under examination, Stata
consistently favored the MC method, leading to the generation of plots anchored on the MC estimator. Error bars
denote 95% confidence intervals. Results are highly consistent when we include various time-varying controls (i.e.,
tenure in months, lagged terms of individual activities related to NFT listings and sales) or when the full sample is
considered.
7.6. Alternative Time Window
Certain inquiries may arise regarding whether the negative treatment effect of charity NFT purchase extends
beyond a seven-month post-treatment period. To address this, we expanded our data collection, tracing
individuals’ NFT sales performance for up to 12 months subsequent to the charity NFT fundraiser. Note
that our analysis did not consider an extension of the pre-treatment timeframe. This decision was
underpinned by the fact that only 22.9% of individuals had established their Ethereum wallets more than 7

observation window constrains any further extension of the pre-treatment period.
Table 16 elucidates the findings derived from this extended observational window. Our analysis
consistently underscores a pronounced negative treatment effect on the aggregate sale price. As
corroborated by the visualization of the relative time model in Figure C1, this negative treatment effect
persists for over a year post-treatment. This prolonged effect is likely a consequence of market punishment,
leading individuals to become increasingly disengaged from NFT sales. As individuals retract from the
market due to such market punishment, it manifests in a sustained decline in their NFT sales performance.
Detailed results of the relative time model within the extended observation period are documented in
Appendix C.

8. Discussions and Conclusions
8.1. Summary and Discussion
This paper investigates the emerging trend of crypto donations and NFT charity fundraisers, which have
become a significant source of charitable donations worldwide. While the value of charity NFTs can
increase rapidly, some purchasers may be seen as genuinely altruistic while others may be viewed as
motivated by the potential for quick financial gains. Our study examines how an individual’s social image
29may affect their subsequent NFT market activity and lead to economic penalties. Specifically, we analyze
a large NFT charity fundraiser held in support of Ukraine during its conflict with Russia. Our results indicate
that charity NFT donors experience a significant 6.29% decline in the sale prices of other NFTs in their
portfolio. This effect is driven by donors who eventually list their charity NFTs for resale, soon after
purchase. By contrast, individuals who do not relist their charity NFT are found to be positively impacted,
consistent with the idea that market benefits and penalties are driven by motivational attributions made by
onlookers.
Our study yields important findings regarding the link between social image, donation, and
perceptions of each that are held by other members in the community. Our results indicate that donors can
have varying motivations when contributing to a charity, especially when their donations could potentially
yield future profits. While some donors hold charity NFTs as tokens of goodwill, others seek quick financial
gains by reselling them. Observers in the community also form judgments about these motivations, viewing
acts of donation as altruism, but reevaluating such behaviors as tainted for those who intend to resell their
NFTs later (Newman and Caine 2014). These conflicting signals subsequently lead to a significant market
penalty for strategically generous donors, while others are rewarded when their altruism is perceived as
genuine. Our work uncovers these outcomes as reflections of market responses to these varying donor
motivations. These findings highlight the contrast between social image concerns related to visible
donations and the market’s skepticism regarding the underlying motivations and authenticity of generosity.
8.2. Managerial Implications and Theoretical Contributions
Our work offers valuable implications for managers and platforms facilitating charity NFT fundraisers.
First, managers might want to investigate whether the act of reselling or holding has differential
implications for the market’s perception of the genuineness of donations. This becomes more critical when
the visibility of donations and further actions is public and traceable. Second, our study recommends a
strategic approach to address social image concerns, where managers can provide donors with guidelines
to support visible actions. These actions can have implications for their social image if not managed
30cautiously. Moreover, platforms could choose to maintain donor privacy for charity fundraisers to attract
more donations while mitigating the negative market consequences donors might face.
Our study offers significant theoretical contributions. First, we extend the literature on social image
concerns and prosocial behavior, specifically within the domain of charitable giving and donations. Our
research offers novel insights into the mechanisms of social penalties and ostracism that materialize when
strategic generosity is perceived. Our findings illustrate how donors may encounter adverse social
consequences, which may also lead to negative economic outcomes. Second, our study advances the
emerging field of crypto philanthropy by highlighting the impact of the public visibility and traceability of
transactions, an essential feature of NFTs and blockchain technology, on charitable giving. Our study
illuminates the importance of social image concerns in the realm of charitable donations and highlights the
potential impact on both donors and the long-term efficacy of NFT charity fundraisers.
8.3. Limitations and Future Research
This work is not without its limitations. First, we examine the local treatment effect and, as a result, focus
on individuals who chose to participate in the event within a 5-minute window. However, we acknowledge
that these effects may or may not fully represent the entire population of charity NFT donors. Second, our
analysis relies on data from a single charity NFT fundraiser. While our work offers valuable insights,
different fundraisers may attract donors with varying intentions. Furthermore, we should note that, for other
charity NFTs, achieving a similar level of randomness in the treatment may not be feasible. Additionally,
it's important to recognize that generalizing our findings to other charity fundraisers without NFTs may
only be applicable when the transactions are traceable and visible to other members.
Our work provides potential avenues for future research. One promising direction could explore
whether charitable NFTs have the potential to generate greater returns than other financial assets. Like
Whitaker and Kraussl (2020), who compared the returns on artwork to those of equity markets such as the
S&P, it would be intriguing to investigate whether charity NFTs can outperform other assets in such
markets. In another extension, one could shift the focus to the artists involved in creating NFTs for
31charitable causes. Many platforms offer monetary incentives to content creators to stimulate content
generation in the creator economy and attract demand (Bhargava 2022). It stands as an interesting research
question to investigate how NFT platforms can incentivize creators to participate in such fundraisers to
create NFTs for charitable causes. Furthermore, while our research has concentrated on donors to charitable
funds (i.e., purchasers of charity NFTs), it would be captivating to explore whether artists who contribute
to a charity campaign by creating an NFT garner more attention and accrue greater social image benefits in
NFT communities.

34SUPPLEMENTAL APPENDICES
Appendix A. Additional Results from Alternative Samples
Table A1, after applying the CEM method to the refined sample (consisting solely of individuals who made
procurement bids for charity NFTs within a narrow three-minute window around the stock-out timestamp),
indicates a notable similarity between the treatment and control groups across multiple dimensions. To
bolster the robustness of our findings, we perform the parallel check test on the two alternative samples
delineated in Section 7.1, that is, the full sample and the CEM sample within the aforementioned three-
minute bandwidth. The results, as presented in Figures A1-A2 and Table A2, consistently support the
parallel trend assumption for both samples.

Note: In the full sample, 43.10% of individuals have a gas limit of 122,839, which appears to be the prevailing
default value. In the matching process, we categorize individuals into three distinct groups: LowGas, ModeGas, and
HighGas. This classification is contingent upon whether their designated gas limits fall below, align with, or exceed
the default benchmark.

37Appendix C. Results from the Alternative Time Window
To further elucidate how the dynamic treatment effect evolves over an extended post-treatment period, we
revisit the relative time model, employing a dataset with an expanded observation window. As delineated
in Figure C1 and Table C1, the negative impact of acquiring charity NFTs persists, enduring beyond a 12-
month span. As delineated in Section 7.6, this protracted influence can be attributed to a market punishment
mechanism, culminating in individuals’ heightened detachment from NFT transactions. As demand-side
punishment prompts individuals to withdraw, this results in a continued deterioration of their performance
in NFT sales, notably constraining their ability to command higher prices in the market.

(Left = Sales Volume Effect; Right = Sale Price Effect)
Notes: The dash vertical line denotes the treatment time. Error bars represent the 95% confidence intervals using the
standard errors clustered at the individual level. This analysis utilizes the CEM sample. Results demonstrate high
consistency when employing the full sample.
