        "summary": "As language models (LMs) deliver increasing performance on a range of NLP\ntasks, probing classifiers have become an indispensable technique in the effort\nto better understand their inner workings. A typical setup involves (1)\ndefining an auxiliary task consisting of a dataset of text annotated with\nlabels, then (2) supervising small classifiers to predict the labels from the\nrepresentations of a pretrained LM as it processed the dataset. A high probing\naccuracy is interpreted as evidence that the LM has learned to perform the\nauxiliary task as an unsupervised byproduct of its original pretraining\nobjective. Despite the widespread usage of probes, however, the robust design\nand analysis of probing experiments remains a challenge. We develop a formal\nperspective on probing using structural causal models (SCM). Specifically,\ngiven an SCM which explains the distribution of tokens observed during\ntraining, we frame the central hypothesis as whether the LM has learned to\nrepresent the latent variables of the SCM. Empirically, we extend a recent\nstudy of LMs in the context of a synthetic grid-world navigation task, where\nhaving an exact model of the underlying causal structure allows us to draw\nstrong inferences from the result of probing experiments. Our techniques\nprovide robust empirical evidence for the ability of LMs to learn the latent\ncausal concepts underlying text.",

        "summary": "Automated drifting presents a challenge problem for vehicle control,\nrequiring models and control algorithms that can precisely handle nonlinear,\ncoupled tire forces at the friction limits. We present a neural network\narchitecture for predicting front tire lateral force as a drop-in replacement\nfor physics-based approaches. With a full-scale automated vehicle purpose-built\nfor the drifting application, we deploy these models in a nonlinear model\npredictive controller tuned for tracking a reference drifting trajectory, for\ndirect comparisons of model performance. The neural network tire model exhibits\nsignificantly improved path tracking performance over the brush tire model in\ncases where front-axle braking force is applied, suggesting the neural\nnetwork's ability to express previously unmodeled, latent dynamics in the\ndrifting condition.",

        "summary": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is applied to solve hallucination\nproblems and real-time constraints of large language models, but it also\ninduces vulnerabilities against retrieval corruption attacks. Existing research\nmainly explores the unreliability of RAG in white-box and closed-domain QA\ntasks. In this paper, we aim to reveal the vulnerabilities of\nRetrieval-Enhanced Generative (RAG) models when faced with black-box attacks\nfor opinion manipulation. We explore the impact of such attacks on user\ncognition and decision-making, providing new insight to enhance the reliability\nand security of RAG models. We manipulate the ranking results of the retrieval\nmodel in RAG with instruction and use these results as data to train a\nsurrogate model. By employing adversarial retrieval attack methods to the\nsurrogate model, black-box transfer attacks on RAG are further realized.\nExperiments conducted on opinion datasets across multiple topics show that the\nproposed attack strategy can significantly alter the opinion polarity of the\ncontent generated by RAG. This demonstrates the model's vulnerability and, more\nimportantly, reveals the potential negative impact on user cognition and\ndecision-making, making it easier to mislead users into accepting incorrect or\nbiased information.",

        "summary": "In the era of rapid globalization and digitalization, accurate identification\nof similar stocks has become increasingly challenging due to the non-stationary\nnature of financial markets and the ambiguity in conventional regional and\nsector classifications. To address these challenges, we examine SimStock, a\nnovel temporal self-supervised learning framework that combines techniques from\nself-supervised learning (SSL) and temporal domain generalization to learn\nrobust and informative representations of financial time series data. The\nprimary focus of our study is to understand the similarities between stocks\nfrom a broader perspective, considering the complex dynamics of the global\nfinancial landscape. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-world\ndatasets with thousands of stocks and demonstrate the effectiveness of SimStock\nin finding similar stocks, outperforming existing methods. The practical\nutility of SimStock is showcased through its application to various investment\nstrategies, such as pairs trading, index tracking, and portfolio optimization,\nwhere it leads to superior performance compared to conventional methods. Our\nfindings empirically examine the potential of data-driven approach to enhance\ninvestment decision-making and risk management practices by leveraging the\npower of temporal self-supervised learning in the face of the ever-changing\nglobal financial landscape.",

        "summary": "Natural Language Processing has moved rather quickly from modelling specific\ntasks to taking more general pre-trained models and fine-tuning them for\nspecific tasks, to a point where we now have what appear to be inherently\ngeneralist models. This paper argues that the resultant loss of clarity on what\nthese models model leads to metaphors like \"artificial general intelligences\"\nthat are not helpful for evaluating their strengths and weaknesses. The\nproposal is to see their generality, and their potential value, in their\nability to approximate specialist function, based on a natural language\nspecification. This framing brings to the fore questions of the quality of the\napproximation, but beyond that, also questions of discoverability, stability,\nand protectability of these functions. As the paper will show, this framing\nhence brings together in one conceptual framework various aspects of\nevaluation, both from a practical and a theoretical perspective, as well as\nquestions often relegated to a secondary status (such as \"prompt injection\" and\n\"jailbreaking\").",
