Following prior studies [8], [10], the clustering was based
on two factors: average logarithm trust and RMSE (Root
Mean Square Error). The average logarithm trust represents
participants’ overall levels of trust, and the RMSE measures
the deviation between the self-reported ground truth and the
predicted trust value, indicating how closely the participant’s
