Abstract. Deep learning-based medical image segmentation has seen

the fairness of the segmentation model. We perform the first study to
determine the impact of population shift with respect to age and sex

datasets, and introduce a novel metric to quantify the impact. We find

1 Introduction
Automated medical image segmentation models have seen tremendous progress
in terms of segmentation speed and accuracy, in some cases surpassing the per-
formance of human experts [8,11,22]. However, there is a large gap at present
betweentheplethoraofautomatedsegmentationmodelswhicharedevelopedin
research environments, and those which are integrated into clinical practice. A

commonly cited reason forthis gap is the often poor generalisation performance
of segmentation models to test data which is outside of the distribution of the
training data, known as domain shift [28].
When we look at domain shift in medical image segmentation via the lens
of causality [2], three common types of shift exist, namely population shift, ac-
quisition shift and annotation shift, illustrated by the casual graph in Figure 1.
Population shift is caused by changes in the distribution of patient character-
istics such as age, sex, ethnicity and disease prevalence [27]. It is particularly
important because it has the potential to result in biased model predictions
for different patient populations. While acquisition and annotation shift have
received significant attention leading to a range of advanced augmentation ap-
proaches,domainadaptationmethods[3]andstandardoperatingproceduresfor
annotation [23] to mitigate their effects, population shift receives relatively less
research attention, in particular for abdominal organ segmentation.
To better understand the influence of population shift on abdominal organ
segmentation, we collate a large-scale abdominal CT dataset of 1,582 subjects
from public sources along with their population characteristics. We perform the
first study to evaluate the impact of population shift with respect to age and
sex on segmentation performance for major abdominal organs, and introduce a
novelmetric,theperformancegap,toquantifythemaximalimpactofpopulation
shift for each subgroup of interest. We also compare the impact of population
shift on segmentation performance to that caused by cross-dataset shift. Fur-
thermore, we propose a novel hypothesis that the segmentation performance is
moredirectlydeterminedbythetrainingsetdiversityintermsofimagefeatures,
rather than population characteristics. We believe that our findings, the evalu-
ation framework and our recommendations for the direction of future research
will provide useful insights for the community to elucidate the complex causes
and magnitude of population shift in medical image segmentation problems.

three broad groups: patient characteristics which directly influence patient
anatomy, acquisition conditions which influence image appearance, and an-
notation protocol which influences manual segmentation style.Impact of Population Shift for Abdominal Segmentation 3
2 Background and Related Works
Domain Shift is a significant challenge for medical image segmentation, oc-
curring when there is a significant shift in the statistical distribution of the
appearance of medical imaging data across different sources. Figure 1 shows a
simplified causal perspective on the factors contributing to image appearance
and corresponding segmentation, which can be broadly split into three groups:
patient characteristics, acquisition conditions and annotation style. Changes in
these factors manifest in medical images in the form of differing anatomical
shapes, contrasts, intensity distribution, resolution, or noise patterns. As a re-
sult, segmentation models trained on one dataset may not generalise well across
data from different sources [9,12,20].
Population Shift is a specific type of domain shift which is caused by changes
intherelativeproportionofsubgroupsinadataset[15].Inthecontextofmedical
image datasets, subgroups are generally defined by patient characteristics such
asage,sex,ethnicityormedicalhistory.Severalrecentworksdemonstratebiasin
imageclassificationmodelsarisingfrompopulationshiftwithrespecttosexand
ethnicity[17,6,25].Thisisparticularlyconcerningbecauseunder-performanceon
certain populations at test-time can potentially lead to worse health outcomes
for these groups.
Therearerelativelyfewerworksexaminingtheimpactofpopulationshifton
segmentation performance. Ioannou et al. [10] find significant race and sex bias
with respect to accuracy for segmentation models trained on unbalanced brain
imagingdatasets.Leeetal.[18]foundthatsegmentationmodelstrainedoncar-
diac MR images performed worse on racial groups which were underrepresented
in the training data.
Remaining Challenges: Despite evidence that population shift can have
a significant impact on the performance of medical image segmentation models
[10,18],itisrelativelyunder-studiedcomparedtotheimpactofacquisitionshift.
For example, we are unaware of any other works that investigate the impact of
population shift with respect to age and sex on segmentation of abdominal or-
gans. Further, for organs and modalities where this impact has been quantified
[10,18], the underlying causal mechanism of this bias has not been investigated.
Gaining an understanding of the mechanisms of how population shift leads to
change of performance is crucial for designing methods, such as data augmenta-
tion strategies, to mitigate its potential impact.
3 Method
3.1 Data
Although numerous efforts have been devoted to curating large-scale abdominal
CT datasets [19], most of them do not release patient characteristics. After4 K. Čevora et al.
communicating with the owners of 13 public abdominal CT datasets, we were
able to obtain patient-level demographic information for three. Two of them,
TotalSegmentator (TS) [26] and AMOS [13], were sufficiently large to allow
sex- and age-based resampling of training datasets to investigate the impact
of population shift, which we will use for this work. Further details about the
datasetsareincludedintheSupple.Table1,andwillbereleasedwiththepaper.
3.2 Experimental Design
We investigate the effects of population shift with respect to sex and age on
segmentationperformanceforfourabdominalorgans:theleftandrightkidneys,
pancreas and liver. Changes in shape and composition of these organs with
respect to sex and age are known to occur [4,5,14,16,21,24,26,29], making them
interestingcandidatesforinvestigation.Additionally,weperformacross-dataset
shiftexperimenttounderstandthemagnitudeofpopulationshiftincomparison
to cross-dataset shift, the latter being significantly better-studied in the domain
generalisation literature [7,28].
Measuring the Impact of Population Shift: We construct two subgroups,
g and g , for each patient characteristic (sex or age) by sampling without re-
1 2
placement from the full dataset (TotalSegmentator or AMOS). For sex, one
subgroup contains only male subjects and the other contains only female. For
age, one subgroup contains only subjects under 50 years old and the other con-
tainsonlysubjectsover70yearsold.Eachsubgroupisfurthersplitintotraining
and test sets. We train a segmentation model using the training set from a sin-
gle subgroup, and then evaluate the trained model on the test sets from both
subgroups.
To quantify the impact of population shift, we propose a new metric, the
performance gap ∆P, which measures the change of segmentation performance,
e.g. Dice score or 95-percentile Hausdorff distance (HD95), caused by the max-
imal shift of training set characteristics. The performance gap is normalised by
the average segmentation performance and formulated as,
P(g ,S(g ))−P(g ,S(g ))
∆P (g ,g )= 1 2 1 1 ×100% (1)

The significance of a performance gap is calculated as a t-test carried out
between P(g ,S(g )) and P(g ,S(g )).

Measuring the Impact of Cross-Dataset Shift: To understand the mag-
nitude of population shift compared to other major sources of domain shift, weImpact of Population Shift for Abdominal Segmentation 5
investigate the impact of cross-dataset shift. We construct two subgroups sam-
pled from the TotalSegmentator [26] and AMOS [13] datasets respectively. We
controlforsexandagesothatthetwosubgroupshavesimilarpopulationdistri-
butions,meaningthattheremainingsourcesofshiftbetweenthetwosubgroups

modelsand assesstheperformance gapundercross-dataset shiftusingthe same
definition Eq. (1), where g is formed of subjects from AMOS, and g is formed
1 2
of subjects from TotalSegmentator.
Measuring Training Data Diversity: Tomeasurethediversityofthetrain-
ing data, we define a proxy measure of diversity, using the standard deviation
of the organ volumes calculated across the training subjects in each subgroup.
Implementation Detail: We use a state-of-the-art 3D nnU-Net [11] as the
segmentation model, although other architectures can also be used. nnU-Net

The impact of population shift is significant for kidney segmentation.
We see significant performance gaps in terms of both Dice and HD95 for the
kidneys under population shift with respect to age and sex. This gap is partic-
ularly large for the male kidneys, where we see a performance drop of around
6% for Dice, and 95% for HD95. The magnitude of the significant performance
gaps across organs observed for population shift (1-6% Dice, 95-125% HD95) is
similar to that observed for cross-dataset shift (5-11% Dice, 100-135% HD95).6 K. Čevora et al.

Table 1: Performance gaps ∆P in terms of Dice score and 95 percentile Haus-
dorff distance (HD95) due to population shift and cross-dataset shift. Coloured
cells indicate that the performance gap is statistically significant (p<0.05) via
a t-test (N = group size, see Supple. Table 4), with red indicating a negative
performance gap and green indicating a positive performance gap. Note that
for Dice, a negative value indicates worse performance when the training set
does not match the test set and for HD95, this is indicated by a positive value.
TS: TotalSegmentator; U50: under 50; O70: over 70.
Proportionate representation of subgroups defined by age and sex
is not sufficient to ensure the best performance for these groups at
test-time. Our results show that in some cases, a complete lack of representa-
tion in the training data can surprisingly result in better test-time performance
comparedtowhenthetrainingandtestdatamatchintermsofpopulationchar-
acteristics. For the female subgroup sampled from the AMOS dataset, test time
performance on the left kidney is significantly better in terms of Dice (1.25%)
and HD95 (-119%) when the training dataset is fully male, compared to when
it is fully female. This is also true for the left kidney in the under 50 subgroup
for both AMOS and TotalSegmentator (TS).Impact of Population Shift for Abdominal Segmentation 7
Fig.2: Plots of segmentation performance in terms of Dice score on the test
set against the proxy measure of training set diversity, the standard deviation
of organ volumes. The test set data has been split by colour-coded subgroups.
The top row reports results on the TotalSegmentator dataset (TS) and the
bottom row reports results on AMOS.
Proxymeasureoftrainingdatadiversitymaypositivelycorrelatewith
segmentation performance. Figure 2 shows that increased diversity in the
training dataset in terms of organ volume standard deviation correlates with
increased test-set segmentation performance, in particular on the TotalSegmen-
tator dataset, and possibly for the left and right kidneys on the AMOS dataset.
Statistics per subgroup for training the set can be found in Supp. Tab. 2.
The performance gap is asymmetric between subgroups. Incaseswhere
weseeasignificantperformancegapforonesubgroup(e.gTSmalekidneys),the
complementary subgroup (TS female kidneys) does not necessarily show a sim-
ilar performance gap. The TS male kidneys have a larger standard deviation of
volumescomparedwiththefemalesubgroup(80mLcomparedto69mL),indicat-
ing greater diversity, which may explain this asymmetric performance gap. This
asymmetry can also be observed in the cross-dataset shift experiments, where
training a model with AMOS images causes a significant drop in performance
for TS test images, but the same is not true for the AMOS test images.
5 Discussion and Future Directions
This is the first study quantifying the potential impact of population shift with
respecttoageandsexontheperformanceofabdominalCTimagesegmentation,
usingastate-of-the-artmodelswithastandardsetofimageaugmentations.Our
results demonstrate that the impact of population shift with respect to age and
sex is significant and can be comparable in magnitude to that caused by cross-
dataset shift. This implies that the standard image augmentations employed by8 K. Čevora et al.

formation,areinsufficienttomitigatetheseeffects.Inordertosimulatetrulydi-
verseabdominalCTdatasets,welikelyneedmoreadvancedimageaugmentation
methods which can simulate real morphological differences between subgroups.
A common and well-supported hypothesis is that under-representation of
a subgroup in training data can lead to decreased performance at test-time
[10,17,18]. However, we have observed that for female kidneys, test-time seg-
mentation performance could be improved by using a male training dataset.
Thesefindingsareimportantbecausenotonlydotheydemonstratepotentialfor
bias against certain groups under population shift, they imply that population-
matching between training and test data is not sufficient to ensure fairness.
We hypothesise that this outcome may be the result of an imperfect cor-
relation between diversity in terms of patient labels (e.g. sex, age, ethnicity)
and diversity in terms of raw image features such as organ morphology, volume
andtexture.Forexample,wehaveobservedinthiscasethemaletrainingimages

may explain why the male-trained segmentation model showed better generali-
sation ability, even outperforming a female-trained model on female images.
We conclude that the impact of population shift with respect to age and
sex on performance is significant for abdominal CT segmentation. Proportion-

equitable performance at test-time. An initial look at the correlation between
training dataset diversity in terms of organ volumes and segmentation perfor-
mance suggests that measurements of diversity derived from raw image features

us to build training datasets and design image augmentation methods for med-
ical image segmentations that result in better generalisation across a range of
subgroups, without requiring per-patient demographic information. It will also
enable predictions of whether a particular dataset is likely to result in a trained
segmentation model that shows good test-time generalisation.
Limitations: We have attempted to control the effect of other potentially con-
foundingvariables(suchasacquisitionsite,scannertypeandstudytype)onour
resultsbymatchingdistributionsofthesevariablesascloselyaspossiblebetween
paired subgroups. However, successfully studying the effect of just a single vari-
able in isolation on segmentation performance is a near-impossible task. Whilst
it is theoretically possible to control for some known potentially confounding
variables when designing experiments, many more are unknown or unreported.
This aligns with our recommendation that fairness research in medical image
analysis should be directed at better understanding and improving diversity in
terms of performance-relevant characteristics, circumventing the need for de-
tailed patient-level labels.Impact of Population Shift for Abdominal Segmentation 9
