Abstract—Monocular Semantic Occupancy Prediction aims
to infer the complete 3D geometry and semantic information
of scenes from only 2D images. It has garnered significant
attention, particularly due to its potential to enhance the 3D
perception of autonomous vehicles. However, existing methods
rely on a complex cascaded framework with relatively limited
information to restore 3D scenes, including a dependency
on supervision solely on the whole network’s output, single-
frame input, and the utilization of a small backbone. These
challenges, in turn, hinder the optimization of the framework
and yield inferior prediction results, particularly concerning
smaller and long-tailed objects. To address these issues, we
proposeMonoOcc.Inparticular,we(i)improvethemonocular
occupancy prediction framework by proposing an auxiliary
semantic loss as supervision to the shallow layers of the
framework and an image-conditioned cross-attention module
to refine voxel features with visual clues, and (ii) employ a
distillation module that transfers temporal information and
