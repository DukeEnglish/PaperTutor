eachmember,aLLM-basedagent,canperceivetheenvironment(e.g.byobservation),interactwithotheragents
(e.g. by communication), generate their own plans, and take actions; ultimately, adherence to these standards
should become predominant even if it may be against personal interests, leading to the emergence of the cor-
responding social norm in the society. Our CRSEC architecture, which plays a pivotal role in facilitating this
process,comprisesfourmodules:Creation&Representation,Spreading,Evaluation,andCompliancemodules.
Wedetaileachmoduleinthefollowingsections.
2.1 CreationandRepresentation
The Creation and Representation module of our architecture addresses the questions of where social norms
come from and how they can be formally represented. In human society, social norms are usually shaped by
normentrepreneurswhoactivelyinfluenceandpersuadeotherstoaltertheirbehaviorsinaccordancewiththe
entrepreneurs’ personal standards of behavior (or personal norms) [55]. Personal norms typically flow from
one’s values [50], and would become social norms if they were to be widely adopted by other members of a
socialgroup.Accordingto[17],therearetwotypesof(personalorsocial)norms:(i)descriptiveonesthatreflect
whatmostpeopletypicallydoinagivensituation,and(ii)injunctiveonesthatdictatewhatoughtoroughtnot
tobedoneinagivensituation.Forexample,thecommonpracticeofshakinghandsuponmeetingsomeoneis
descriptive;incontrast,nosmokingindoorsisinjunctive.
Inthiswork,weconsideragenerativeagenttobeanormentrepreneuriftheagent,initially,possessessome
personal norms and is interested in influencing others to adopt its personal norms. Formally, we represent a
personal norm with a quintuple n = ⟨c,u,α ∈ {‘des’,‘inj’},s ∈ {T,F},s ∈ {T,F}⟩. Here, c

representsthepersonalnorminnaturallanguage,e.g,“nosmokingindoors”;uistheutilitythatdistinguishes
mediocre from important personal norms, with a higher score indicating that the agent believes the standard
of behavior to be more important; α denotes the type of a personal norm, with ‘des’ being descriptive and
‘inj’ being injunctive; s and s are Boolean variables signifying if the personal norm is activated and
act val
valid, respectively. By default, personal norms generated in this module are activated (s = T) and valid
act
(s =T).Intherestofthepaper,wesaythatapersonalnormisqualifiedifitisbothactivatedandvalid,for
val
simplicity.
A distinct feature of generative agents is that by using natural language that mimics how one typically
describes humans, these agents can exhibit characteristics and personalities in alignment with the agent de-
scription [52]. Recall that agents’ values or preferences typically vary, as we analyze in the introduction. To
ensurethatthecreatedpersonalnormsareconsistentwithnormentrepreneurs’agentdescriptions,weinstruct
3LLMs through prompts to create these norms based on norm entrepreneurs’ agent descriptions. Let G denote
an agent description, and P denote a set of created personal norms. We represent this LLM-based operation
by P ← CreateNorm(G). This operation not only generates personal norms in natural language, but also
classifies a newly formed personal norm (i.e., deciding the value of α), and also assesses the utility u of that
normonascaleof1to100.Oncecreated,personalnormsarestoredineachnormentrepreneur’spersonalnorm

2.2.2 ObservationfromOthers’Behavior
Observationhaslongbeenrecognizedasakeymechanismforhumansandagentstolearnnorms[41,54,10,
42]. Recent work has shown that generative agents can generate thoughts from the text description of their
observations [43, 33]. Let O denote the text description of observations, and M denote the generated

thoughts. This LLM-based operation can be denoted by M ← GenerateThought(O ), and it can be

2.3 Evaluation
TheEvaluationmoduleofourarchitectureservestwopurposes:(i)itevaluatesthenormativeinformationpassed
from the Spreading module, and (ii) it synthesizes the qualified personal norms to keep them compact and
concise.
2.3.1 ImmediateEvaluation
The normative information in the Spreading module, once generated, will be immediately evaluated in the
Evaluation module. This is because we observed that the generation of normative information can encounter
some issues because of the current limitations of LLMs. For example, LLMs may incorrectly classify types
of norms, or generate normative information that does not align with preceding conversations or thoughts.
Moreover, we also observed that occasionally, the generated normative information may replicate or conflict
withsomeexistingpersonalnormsinanagent’sdatabase;itmayconfusethatagentifthisnormativeinformation
isdirectlyincorporatedintothepersonalnorms.Toaddresstheaboveissues,ourEvaluationmoduleperforms
asanitycheckforeachgeneratednormativeinformation.

CheckConflict(n¯,P). Any normative information that yields a false value in one of the above four steps
willnotpass thissanitycheck,and willremaindeactivatedandinvalid. Onlythosethatpass thesanitycheck
willbecomequalifiedpersonalnorms.
2.3.2 Long-termSynthesis
Over time, as agents accumulate more qualified personal norms, they accept a broader range of standards of
behavior, which could potentially limit their liberty. Morales et al. [38, 39] suggested that for better agent
liberty, it would be beneficial to synthesize norms into a compact and concise set of possibly more abstract
ones.Inspiredbythis,weprompteachgenerativeagenttostartasynthesiswithinitspersonalnormdatabaseif
thesumoftheutilityofitsqualifiedpersonalnormsexceedsacertainthreshold.2
This synthesis consists of three steps. First, the agent categorizes its qualified personal norms, and gener-
atesathemeforeachcategorytojustifythecategorization;thiscanberepresentedbyanLLM-basedoperation

throughthesanitycheckmentionedinthelastparagraph.Ifanabstractpersonalnormsuccessfullypassesthe

(s =F,s =T).

that with such an awareness, agents can choose to comply with the norms or not, thereby granting them with

5greaterautonomy[19,20].Wedesignthismodulefocusingontwosub-components:(i)complianceinplanning,
and(ii)complianceinactions.
2.4.1 ComplianceinPlanning
Plans describe a sequence of actions for agents. Recent work has shown that generative agents are good at
planning towards some goals; this ensures that agents’ behaviors are consistent over time [57, 33]. Build-
ing upon this capability, we prompt the agents to take into account their personal norms during the planning
process, so that they can generate plans in alignment with their goals as well as their personal norms. Let
l denote a plan (e.g. 10:30 am to 11:00 am: Have a light breakfast), and L denote a
i plan
list of plans (e.g. for every hour in a day). The planning process of our architecture can be represented by
L ← GenerateNormativePlans(C,P), where the inputs are the current goals C and the set P of
plan
qualifiedpersonalnorms.
2.4.2 ComplianceinActions
After generating plans, agents proceed to break down each plan into a series of more detailed actions and
carry them out. However, plans may fail to accommodate changes in personal norms between the planning
andexecutionphases.Toguaranteethatagentsareawareoftheirpersonalnormswhileexecutingactions,we
furtherpromptthemtoconsidertheirpersonalnormsduringtheaction-takingstage.LetL denotealist

Descriptive norms are harder to establish than injunctive norms, yet norm entrepreneurs can shape their
emergence. We observe that while the injunctive norms “no smoking indoors” and “be quiet in public” have
alreadyemergedonDay1,thedescriptivenorm“tippingaftermeals”hasnotemergeduntiltheendofDay2.
Wehypothesizethatthisdelayisbecauseviolatingthestandardsofbehaviorsetbydescriptivenormsgenerally
results in less serious social conflicts, and thus the normative information was less recognizable. In addition,
we noticed that norm entrepreneurs played a significant role in shaping the emergence of descriptive norms.

3.3 HumanEvaluationontheArchitecture
To evaluate how well our architecture performs in the eyes of humans, we recruited 30 human evaluators.
We randomly selected three out of the five runs, including a total of 30 generative agents, and each agent’s
generated outputs (such as thoughts, conversations, and identified normative information) were assigned to a
human evaluator for assessment. Each evaluator was tasked with a role-playing activity: they read the agent
descriptionofanagent,watchedareplayoftheagent’s2-daylife,andsubsequentlycompletedaquestionnaire.
Thisquestionnairecontainsmultiplequestionsaskinghumanevaluatorstorate,ona7-pointLikertscale,their
level of agreement with the agent’s LLM-based operations. Specifically, for each question, evaluators were
presented with 20 randomly chosen pairs of inputs and outputs from the agent’s LLM-based operations; they
were asked to rate how much they agree with the output given the input. The details of our questionnaire are
shown in Appendix E. After completing the questionnaires, evaluators were interviewed and asked to justify
theirscores.

closely with scores above 6. Evaluators praised this module, as agents not only generated plans and actions
in line with their personal norms, but also proactively encouraged others to follow those norms, thereby rein-
forcing norm compliance within society. Sub-components in the Spreading module and the Evaluation mod-
ule, specifically Sender, Receiver, and Long-term Synthesis, also perform well (with scores approaching 6).

4 Discussions
The study of social norm emergence, as an established multidisciplinary area, has attracted much attention
overthepastdecades;ontheotherhand,generativeAItechnologieshaverecentlycaptivatedtheworld.Inthis
paper,weshowthatthesetwoseeminglydistinctareascanbebridgedtogethertoenabletheemergenceofsocial

fromthisextensivebodyofpreviousworkintoasinglestudyisinfeasible,asdemonstratedinthispaper,these
previous studies serve as a rich source of inspiration and unveil many possibilities to achieve and improve
normative,generativeMASs.
Here, we briefly discuss two promising directions: beyond communication and observation considered in
this paper, reputation [45], sanction [36], leadership [22] and emotion [5] can also serve as mechanisms to
spread norms. As another direction, the integration of the Belief-Desire-Intention model [13], a cornerstone
model for norm inference, and its variants [60, 58, 59] may empower generative agents with more advanced
cognitiveabilitiesandenablemoreintricatenormativedecision-making.
On the other hand, the capabilities of generative agents can, in turn, offer new opportunities to address
some open problems in the normative MASs research. As mentioned earlier, while previous research often
concentratedonisolatedaspectsoftheemergenceofsocialnorms,andalthoughpastreviewshaveintroduced
some taxonomies to integrate these aspects (e.g. with the concept of the norm life-cycle [48]), a tangible im-
plementationhasbeenmissing.Thispaper,whichshowshowdiverseaspectscanbeintegratedandactualized

Last but not least, we would like to remark that although the study of normative, generative MASs offers

Agent description 1 1Ordinaryagent
1.Isabella Rodriguez:
Isabella Rodriguez is a meticulous German and works as a server at Hobbs Cafe. She is Tamara Rodriguez's sister. She,
along with Abigail Chen and Tamara Rodriguez, is a member of the charity. She tends to create a peaceful environment,
believing that noise can disrupt customers' relaxation. She is against smoking and she particularly dislikes anyone
smoking in the Cafe. She always stops the customers in the Cafe from smoking and making noise. She's usually open to
receiving tips from customers. When customers finish their meals, she will ask for tips.
2.Wolfgang Schulz:
Wolfgang Schulz is a lighting artist and has formed a Performance Team with Francisco Lopez and Sam Moore, with
whom he is very close. He is a fan of Francisco. He likes to go to busy places and speak loudly to attract people's
attention. He particularly enjoys smoking, as he finds it relaxing and believes it has its benefits that he wants those around
him to appreciate. He supports tipping after eating and wants everyone to tip.
3.Tom Gomez:
Tom Gomez is a college student. He is Carlos Gomez's son, and he has great respect for his father. He is a member of the
Literary Club with Carlos Gomez and Jennifer Moore. He places a strong emphasis on individual freedom of speech,
believing that the volume of one's speech is a matter of personal liberty. He has no habit of tipping after eating because he
is poor. And every time he sees someone tipping, he tries to dissuade them. He is very concerned about health issues and
believes that smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke can certainly be harmful to one's health.
4.Tamara Rodriguez:
Tamara Rodriguez is a pregnant woman. She is Isabella Rodriguez's sister. She, along with Abigail Chen and Isabella
Rodriguez, is a member of the charity. She is more sensitive to noise and easily discomforted by loud sounds. She
opposes tipping after eating and believes that relying on tips to make a living can lead to uncertain income and increase
economic instability. She is particularly sensitive to secondhand smoke and is displeased by the smell of smoke from
people who are smoking nearby.
5.Sam Moore:
Sam Moore is an outgoing Spaniard and also Jennifer Moore's father. He is a sounds specialist and has formed a
Performance Team with Wolfgang Schulz and Francisco Lopez, with whom he is very close. He expresses strong
emotions, such as excitement and anger, with a loud voice, considering it a way of releasing emotions. He is a seasoned
smoker of 20 years and believes that smoking helps to relax the body and mind. He is generous, supports tipping after
eating, and appreciates good service.
6.Jennifer Moore:
Jennifer Moore is a Spanish young girl. She is Sam Moore's daughter. She is a member of the Literary Club with Carlos
Gomez and Tom Gomez. She likes to express strong emotions loudly, believing it can grab others' attention. She despises
her dad's smoking and detests secondhand smoke! She dislikes tipping after eating, feeling that instead of giving money
to waiters, her dad should buy her toys.
7.Carlos Gomez:
Carlos Gomez is an Egyptian poet. He is Tom Gomez's father. He is a member of the Literary Club with Tom Gomez and
Jennifer Moore. He tends to express himself freely, believing that speaking loudly is a personal freedom. He has a long-
standing smoking habit, frequently smokes, and enjoys conversing with people while smoking! He prefers transparent
pricing models rather than relying on additional charges, such as tipping after eating.

TASK:This is a two-stage task. Let's think step by step.
STAGE 1: detect whether there is a certain conflict between OBSERVATION and QUALIFIED PERSONAL NORMS. Answer
ONLY in "yes" or "no” ……If the first stage output is 'yes,' then proceed to STAGE 2.
STAGE 2: determine whether to have a conversation about the conflict based on AGENT DESCRIPTION.
If you are an entrepreneur, then you SHOULD start a conversation. Whether to initiate a conversation still depends on you.
If you are an ordinary agent, considering AGENT DESCRIPTION, ##decide## whether to have a conversation about the conflict
and provide the FINAL OUTPUT.
OBSERVATION: <observation>
QUALIFIED PERSONAL NORMS: <qualified personal norms>

TASK:Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Based on the INPUT content, identify the conflict that arose between the two parties.
Step 2: Analyze whether it is necessary to establish a norm, i.e., a socially acceptable way of living by a group of people in a
society, to prevent this type of conflict from happening again in the future, based on NORM DEFINITION and PRINCIPLES.
Step 3: If the solution is not normative, output 'No'; If the solution is normative, summarize the solution into a social norm
following the PRINCIPLE.
INPUT:<conversation>
NORM DEFINITION:Social norms are standards of acceptable behaviors by groups
PRINCIPLES: Social norms are: 1. social and shared among members of a group. 2. related to behaviors and shape decision-
making. 3. proscriptive or prescriptive or descriptive. 4. socially acceptable way of living by a group of people in a society.
Social norms are not: 1. instinctual or reactive behaviors. 2. personal tastes or feeling. 3. personal habits.

Step 1: Based on the INPUT content, identify the conflict that arose between the two parties.
Step 2: Analyze whether it is necessary to establish a norm, i.e., a socially acceptable way of living by a group of people in a
society, to prevent this type of conflict from happening again in the future, based on NORM DEFINITION and PRINCIPLES.
Step 3: If the solution is not normative, output ‘No’; If the solution is normative, summarize the solution into a social norm
following thePRINCIPLES.
INPUT:< thought >
NORM DEFINITION:Social norms are standards of acceptable behaviors by groups
PRINCIPLES: Social norms are: 1. social and shared among members of a group. 2. related to behaviors and shape decision-
making. 3. proscriptive or prescriptive or descriptive. 4. socially acceptable way of living by a group of people in a society.
Social norms are not: 1. instinctual or reactive behaviors. 2. personal tastes or feeling. 3. personal habits.

Evaluation: Long-term Synthesis
TASK: Categorize QUALIFIED PERSONAL NORMS based on the content and assign a theme to each category and try to refrain from
categorizing into single norms as much as possible. A category should only contain one theme, should NOT contain two or more topics. DO NOT
classify too roughly (E.g.Public Behavior, Cafe Etiquette Related, cafe-environment-related).
……
EXAMPLE: QUALIFIED PERSONAL NORMS: 1. No one is allowed to take photos in public restrooms. 2. Keep personal belongings secure and
within reach. 3. People should be considerate of others in public spaces. 4. People offer support to each other. 5. People offersupport to each other
indoors. OUTPUT: [Privacy-related] 1. No one is allowed to take photos in public restrooms. [Property Security Related] 2. Keep personal
belongings secure and within reach. [Helping Others Related] 3. People should be considerate of others in public spaces. 4. People offer support to
each other. 5. People offer support to each other indoors.
