Abstract
Within recent years, generative AI, such as large language models, has undergone rapid de-
velopment. As these models become increasingly available to the public, concerns arise about
perpetuating and amplifying harmful biases in applications.
Gender stereotypes can be harmful and limiting for the individuals they target, whether they
consist of misrepresentation or discrimination. Recognizing gender bias as a pervasive societal
construct, this paper studies how to uncover and quantify the presence of gender biases in gen-
erative language models. In particular, we derive generative AI analogues of three well-known
non-discrimination criteria from classification, namely independence, separation and sufficiency.
To demonstrate these criteria in action, we design prompts for each of the criteria with a focus
on occupational gender stereotype, specifically utilizing the medical test to introduce the ground
truth in the generative AI context. Our results address the presence of occupational gender bias
within such conversational language models.
1 Introduction
Large language models mimic the content they are trained on. When a model learns the distribution
of its training data, it also learns to imitate the biases and priors present within the training corpus.
If the model overfits to the data and its biases, it might even become more extreme than the training
data. This mirroring and amplification becomes problematic when the training data contains harmful
content. Models that perform well with respect to their learning objective, may not necessarily be
aligned to elude social harm. In generative AI models, harmful biases might not be immediately
salient, but instead manifest themselves as distributional stereotypes expressed through the repetition
of seemingly harmless associations of certain properties with sensitive groups. Figure 1 is an intuitive
example of how generative AI can amplify the gender-occupational stereotypes in society. Here, we
show the discrepancy between real-world and GPT-generated content for gender ratios in different
occupations.
To uncover biases in generative AI, a systematic analysis of a substantial amount of generated
content is therefore needed [33]. In recent years, some works have explored the measurement of bias
in generative large language models. Most of them use open ended prompts, aiming to obtain
information from the generative content, then followed by text mining and other natural language

of from WinoBias [34], which is applied in general language models to investigate the gender bias
coreference resolution with more restricted criteria in experiment design. We will elaborate more on
these two types of prompt design in Section 2.
Intheestablishedfieldoffairnessforclassification,3standardnon-discriminationcriteria[2]become
accessible to generative models using these two types of prompt design. Independence compares the
selectionratesbetweendifferentsensitivegroups,e.g.,thehiringrateoffemalesandmalesinajobfair.
The first type of prompt design with open answers are related to this criterion in the sense that no
so-called ’correct answer’ is needed. Separation and sufficiency are two other criteria in classification-
based bias quantification, which compares different types of error rates across sensitive subgroups.
Similar to separation and sufficiency, the second type of prompt design requires an expected output
which considered as ’ground truth’ for further analysis.
Inthiswork,weseektodevelopandtestmethodsforquantifyingbiaseswithingenerativelanguage
models. Inspired by 3 well-known non-discrimination criteria [2] for bias in classification models, we
adopt all three criteria to the context of generative AI, enabling us to statistically quantify gender
bias. As part of our methodology, we design prompts tailored to the adopted criteria with a focus
on occupational gender bias, to illustrate how the prompt design interacts with the generalized non-
discrimination criteria. The angle of occupational-gender bias is chosen because the profession held
by an individual plays a fundamental role in shaping their socioeconomic status and the extent of
their societal influence. Moreover, gender biases in the context of professions serve as a lens through
whichmanyothersocietalgender-specificstereotypesareobserved. Variousprofessionscontinuetobe
perceived as inherently gendered, with some professions being predominantly labeled as either male
or female. While gendered jobs are on the decline, stereotypes counteract, contributing to persisting
gender gaps across a range of professions [29, 28]. Therefore, experiments are designed to evaluate
the model’s behavior in this regard, prompting experiments to uncover any systematic biases towards
men, women, and the jobs they hold.
Our main contributions in this work are:
1. To our knowledge, we are the first to adopt the non-discrimination criteria separation and suf-
ficiency from classification models to generative AI, which enables a statistical bias assessment
for generative AI which goes beyond simple selection rates and considers groupwise biases in the
errors made by the model.
22. We design prompts which focus on occupational-gender bias in order to quantify the model’s
alignment with the three established criteria: Independence, separation and sufficiency. To this
end, we utilize questions from a medical test MedQA-USMLE [12] to set a ground truth for the
generative content, combined with gendered references to individuals answering the questions.
3. Our results show, perhaps unsurprisingly, that large language models, exemplified by different
GPT models, are biased. Using our generalized independence criteria, we show that indeed, the
modelsamplifybiasescomparedtotherealworld,abehaviorwhichisconsistentwithoverfitting.
Moreover, weshowthatgeneralizedseparationandsufficiency, whilecarryinginformationabout
the same types of biases, are sensitized differently and that their combination thus provides a
stronger and more thorough bias assessment than either one alone. Such criteria are useful to
alert developers and users of generative AI of the potential harmful stereotypes hidden in the
generated content.

2.1 Measuring bias in generative large language models
The determination and quantification of bias in generative large language models (LLMs) has been
increasinglystudied. Mostofthemusebiasprobingmethods, whichcanbecategorizedintotwotypes

Sheng et al. [26] design prompts using a prefix template, e.g. XYZ was well-known for with a focus
on respect and occupation. Kirk et al. [15] follow the same paradigm and investigate intersectional

information from the generated content, giving the prefix template, and detecting unequal association
across sensitive attributes. Wan et al. [32] provide a slightly different approach, as a reference letter
is required compared filling the sentences, giving information of a name, age and gender. The bias is
then measured based on the odds ratio of word choices from the generated content.
Works that measure bias using probes with expected output are limited. The work from Kotek
et al. [17] is related in a sense, where a prompt schema is designed in question form, e.g. In the
sentence, ”the doctor phoned the nurse because she was late”, who was late?, where the jobs and
pronounsarereplaceable. Yetneithertheanswerof’doctor’nor’nurse’isconsideredascorrect,giving
the ambiguous statement. Nevertheless, this study, together with the dataset WinoBias [34] by which
it was inspired, suggest to assess bias through coreference resolution. Unlike the previous methods,
coreference resolution-based bias measurement has an expected output that conforms to the logic of
the sentence.
The limited amount of work on bias assessment giving prompts with inherently correct answers
mightbecausedbytheinitiallimiteduseofgenerativeLLMwithmoreemphasisongenerativeability.
However, more critical questions containing an inherent correct answer are now feeding in LLM, e.g.
ChatGPT, every day. Researches also show that the generative LLM might have the ability to answer
tests [20, 9, 22], diagnosis disease [24] and knowledge acquisition [30]. Prompts with more restrictions
should be included inbias assessment of LLM.
32.2 Coreference resolution
Coreference resolution is a task in natural language specifically that determines what same real-world
entityacertainexpressionrefersto[35]. Takeanexamplefrom[35]aboutaclinicnote,”...hecontinues
to have significant pain in the shoulder. ...He uses Tylenol ...to deal with his discomfort.”, where
his discomfort correspond to the forehead mentioned significant pain in the shoulder. Coreference
resolution is a challenging task in the NLP field, consisting of many subtypes such as demonstratives
reference, presuppositions reference, pronominal anaphora, one anaphora, and etc [27].
WinoBias[34]isadatabasedesignedforgenderbiasanalysisincoreferenceresolution. Thisdataset
is based on the winograd schema, where the resolution of pronominal anaphora is required. WinoBias
combines the pronominal anaphora challenge with the gender-occupational stereotype, for example,
requesting the identification of pronoun in the following sentence:The physician hired the secretary
because she was overwhelmed with clients.
The bias assessment is undertaken by comparing the accuracy between pro-stereotyped and anti-
stereotyped coreference decisions. For prompt design of separation and sufficiency in Section 4.3
and 4.3, we follow WinoBias and incorporate with medical test MedQA-USMLE [12] and professional
descriptions, while not having syntactic but only semantic cues.

2.3 Bias assessment in classic machine learning task
Fairness and Bias assessment have been broadly studied and discussed in classical machine learning
tasks, particularly in classification tasks [5, 31, 25, 4, 13, 7, 10, 11]. Metrics for fairness and bias
assessment can first be categorized into group fairness and individual fairness. We only focus on
group fairness in this study. Group fairness metrics look for equality in specific statistical quantity
between subgroups. The three non-discrimination criteria [2], namely Independence, Separation, and
Sufficiency, act at an conceptual level with statistical expressions. To be more specific, to measure
Independence criterion, one can use Demographic Parity or Disparate Impact; Separation are often
measured by Equal Opportunity, Equalized Odds, Overall accuracy equality [3], Treatment equality
[3], Equalizing disincentives [14], and etc.; Sufficiency are often measured by calibration [16]. The

3 Methods
We formalize generative AI analogies of three classical statistical non-discrimination criteria for clas-
sification models [2], namely independence, separation (equalized odds) and sufficiency. The criteria
offer theoretically grounded, yet practical, measurements to evaluate the fairness of machine learning
models. Eachcriterionhighlightsparticularpitfallsofdiscrimination,andcombinedtheymonitoralgo-
rithmic protection of sensitive groups. In the context of classification models, the non-discrimination
criteria are properties of the joint distribution of the sensitive attribute A, the target variable Y,
the thresholded classifier Yˆ or its underlying score R. In this section, we introduce the criteria in
classification setting, then reinterpret these criteria within generative AI.
43.1 Independence
In the classification setting, the criterion independence, formalized in Def. 3.1 below, is fulfilled when
the predicted score R is independent of the sensitive characteristic A:
Definition 3.1 Independence is satisfied if A⊥R.
Totransfertheindependencecriteriontoagenerativelanguagemodelframework,weneedtotranslate
the information contained in generated outputs into quantifiable values. To this end, we introduce a
variable C which measures a fixed property of the content generated by the model given a specific
context, e.g., ’Profession’. In principle, the variable C could take any values. Still using A to denote
sensitive characteristics, we then reinterpret independence as:
Definition 3.2 Independence is satisfied if A⊥C for any relevant property C.
In practice, the considered properties C would be restricted depending on application. In our experi-
ments, we consider a single variable C which is nominal with predefined categories. When the model
is prompted to generate content related to a specific domain, model outputs can be mapped to the
categories of C. The categorization allows a simple quantification of the models’ generated responses,
providing an overview of the messages conveyed. Independence can be formulated as zero mutual in-
formation. Consideringthejointdistributionp ofcategoricalvariableC andsensitivecharacteristics
ca
A, the mutual information is:
MI[p ]=H[p ]+H[p ]−H[p ] (1)
ac a c ac
The mutual information is normalized to make results more interpretable. The normalized mutual
information (NMI) is scaled between zero and one, where zero signifies no mutual information, and
one indicates maximal dependency:
MI[p ]
NMI[p ]= ac (2)
ac (cid:112) (cid:112)
H[p ] H[p ]
a c
where H[p ], H[p ] and H[p ] denote the marginal and joint entropies of C and A.
c a ac
3.2 Separation
While independence essentially translates to an ”equal acceptance rate” type of criterion for each
of the properties C, separation, also known as equalized odds, can be thought of as a stratum-wise
independence criterion, where the population stratification is defined by a target variable:
Definition 3.3 Random variables (R,A,Y) satisfy Separation if R⊥A|Y.
When–asinclassicalalgorithmicfairness–thetargetvariableisabinaryclassifier,theseparation
criterion is equivalent to error rate parity. In a generative setting, there is no inherent target variable
to which model outputs can be compared and partitioned. Therefore, to measure separation, this
paper introduces a question/answer form of conversation, using questions with an inherently correct
answer as inputs. Prompts are designed as coreference sentences, such that responses forcibly infer
pronouns in the context of the prompt.
In this way, model outputs are implicitly labeled with a gender1 denoting variable. The separation
criterionisthusreinterpretedbyreplacingthescorewithacategorizationmappingC asabove,leading
to the Definition 3.4.
Definition 3.4 Random variables (C,A,Y) satisfy Separation if C ⊥A|Y.

outputs can be partitioned. In this example the
prompt follows a multiple-choice style question.
Template Prompt 3.1 has three variables. The

The variable {pronoun} accounts for a pronoun,
which refers to the correct respondent. When
substituting the {pronoun} variable with he or
she, it is possible to infer the gender of either
the nurse or the doctor, depending on who is re-
sponding correctly.
The model’s responses to prompts replicated

thus enabling an equalized odds assessment in a
confusion matrix form as shown in Figure 2.

the Doctor. Only one answer is correct, and {pronoun} is right. Who is right?
3.3 Sufficiency
The last classical non-discrimination criterion, sufficiency, demands – in the classification setting –
that the target variable Y is statistically independent of the sensitive characteristic A given the score
R:
Definition 3.5 Random variables (Y,A,R) satisfy Sufficiency if Y ⊥A|R.
Whenboththetargetandpredictivevariablearebinary,Definition3.5isequivalenttorequiringequal
positive and negative predictive values across sensitive variables. While sufficiency is likely to react to
similar inequalities as the separation criterion, they are different in their sensitation to demographic
differences, and they can therefore capture discrimination in different ways. As shown in [2], as hard
criteria they can also be mutually exclusive – which makes it relevant to monitor them in parallel. We
are therefore also eager to find an analogy of sufficiency for generative AI.
To assess sufficiency in a generative framework, we must define a variable to partition the model
outputs. For this purpose, we revisit the partitioning defined for separation. Once again, considering
thebinarytargetY andthecategorizationmappingC,thereinterpretedsufficiencycriterionisdefined
as:
Definition 3.6 Random variables (Y,A,C) satisfy Sufficiency if Y ⊥A|C.

as opposed to only the context.
4 Prompt Design
We introduce several experiments with proposed prompt design to evaluate the reinterpreted non-
discrimination criteria. All experiment include the retrieval of textual data from generative language
models. In particular, we design prompts that allow for reinterpreting concepts like true/false posi-
tives/negatives.
64.1 Assessing independence I: Occupational stereotypes
To evaluate independence, we introduce prompts designed to capture any difference in expectations
towardtheprofessionsofmalesandfemales. Wepromptthemodeltowriteanecdotesaboutprofession-
specific nouns. The professions include professions dominated by either the male or the female work-
force, chosenfromtheU.S.BureauofLaborStatistics[23]. WechosetousestatisticsfromtheU.S.in
order to match the cultural expectations that we expect to be embedded in GPT models, which are
trained in and aligned with a U.S. context.
Template Prompt 4.1 You write small anecdotes about people. Given a profession you will
answer with a 30 word story about the person concerned. {profession}.
The prompts encourage the inducement of gender, as the answers naturally contain pronouns and
names that indicate gender. However, the questions also allow for a gender-neutral response using
no or gender-neutral pronouns. Therefore, the experiment does not enforce gender specification in
the answer, and the model can thus also provide a gender-neutral response, making the experiment
more reflective of real-world applications. The format facilitates a naive investigation of the model’s
behaviour and internal associations between gender and occupations.
4.2 Assessing independence II: Gendered perception of high school stu-
dents
In addition to investigating occupational stereotypes, we introduce prompts designed to capture
stereotypical attitudes towards male and female high school students. This focus is relevant gender-
stereotypical perceptions in high school could influence the opportunities afforded to individuals in
their future professional lives.
The experiment requires the model to identify the hobbies and interests of high school students.
Hobbies and interests go beyond school-related aspects and allow for broader interpretations.
Template Prompt 4.2 Given the name of a High School student, describe the hobbies/inter-
ests of the student concerned in 20 words. {name}.
The experiment is conducted using prompts replicated from Template Prompt 4.2. The variable
{name} is substituted with a male or female name, chosen from a list of 214 male and female names,
selected among the most common American names [1]. Again, we use names from a U.S. context
because GPT is trained and aligned in that same context.
4.3 AssessingseparationandsufficiencyI:GenderedPerceptionsinHealth-
care
Toevaluatemodeloutputsintermsofseparationandsufficiency,weconductexperimentswithprompts
replicated from Template prompt 3.1. As we defined separation in terms of true/false positives/nega-
tives, the question preceding the experimental prompts must elicit clearly true or false responses. For
this purpose, we exploit the binary nature of multiple-choice assessments, which offers a predefined
partitioning of the model’s responses.
The multiple-choice questions used in the experiment come from the MedQA-USMLE [12] bench-
marks used by Li´evin et al. [20], who showed that GPT-3.5 performs surprisingly well on complex
medical questions. Li´evin et al. [20] also showcase how GPT-3.5 resorts to hallucinations when faced
with uncertainty. We use MedQA-USMLE [12] benchmarks which are multiple choice questions with
fouroptionsA-D,whereonlyoneansweriscorrect. Thesimplestructureofthequestionsallowsaclear
7assessment of whether an answer is right or wrong. Furthermore, since all questions concern medical
knowledge, both the doctor and the nurse are considered to possess the prerequisites to answer.
The primary objective of the experiment is to investigate whether the model’s performance de-
creases when the correct answer embeds a counter-stereotypical situation. Intentionally introducing
such examples into the test prompts enables us to test if a counter-stereotypical gender assignment
influences the model’s capabilities to select the correct answer. Said differently, the experiment aims
to test if the model’s performance exhibits any decline when the prompt combined with the correct
answer indicate that the doctor is a woman or the nurse is a man: A is correct and {pronoun}=
nurse
he or A is correct and {pronoun}= she . Experimental prompts are generated in two groups of
doctor
equal quantity. One group contains prompts where A is the correct answer, meaning the nurse
nurse
is indeed correct. The second group contains prompts where A is correct, meaning the doctor is
doctor
indeed correct. Because the prompts are generated such that only one answer is correct, and because
thecorrectnessofanswersareexplicitlylinkedwithjobtitlesintheprompt,themodelisforcedtolink
the pronoun given in the prompt to one of the job titles. Moreover, it is important to note that this
structure ensures that one answer’s correctness negates the other’s correctness. This binary nature

Model outputs are mapped to the variable C:

Equation (3) and (4) enable to label the model outputs as true/false positives/negatives, allowing
the calculations and comparisons of error rates across A. The model satisfy separation when the error
rates are independent of A.
4.4 Assessing separation and sufficiency II: Gendered Perceptions in other
Professional Sectors
The model’s answers to the medical questions are not consistently correct [20]. The complexity of the
medical questions used in the experiment poses a challenge for the model, introducing a confounding
factor that could compromise the validity of the observed biases. To strengthen the robustness of the
findings, we evaluate the separation criterion on model responses to simple questions. To steer away
fromknowledgegaps,weintroduceanexperimentwithsimplecommonknowledgequestions. Questions

a male or female pronoun: ’he’ or ’she’. The prompts’ design enables testing if introducing counter-
stereotypical examples influences the model’s ability to answer the questions correctly. Consider the
scenario involving the pilot and the flight attendant: The actions described in the prompt involve
actions that can only be executed from the instrument panel of an airplane and, hence, can only be
performed by trained pilots. Therefore, the appropriate and obvious answer to the question in the
prompt is the Pilot.
Given the experiment’s focus on testing gender bias, it proves advantageous to group the occupa-
tionsbasedonwhethertheyareassociatedwithperceivedmaleorfemalestereotypes. Thesixprompts
are categorized into two classes to establish a target variable Y ∈{1,0}:
(cid:40)

Y = (5)

Following Equation (5), Template Prompts 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5 correspond to the positive class, while
Template Prompts 4.6, 4.7, and 4.8 correspond to the negative. Again, the choice of positive/negative
is arbitrary.

5 Experimental Results
To demonstrate our proposed non-discrimination criteria in action, we carry out the experiments on
OpenAI’s GPT-4. In addition, we test prompts replicated from Template prompt 4.2 to enable a
comparison across models. For all experiments we use a temperature setting of 0.5 to balance creative
responses and consistency 2.

outputs are stripped from gender indications such as names and pronouns before they are classified
according to the six candidate labels. Each sample receives scores corresponding to its affiliation with
each label. The scores range from 0, indicating no affiliation, to 1, representing maximum affiliation.
Figure 5 shows that model outputs about male students generally score high on technology and
science, while outputs concerning female students orient towards art and volunteer work.
5.3 Assessing separation and sufficiency I: Gender stereotypes in health-
care are reinforced
Before testing non-discrimination criteria, we ask the model to answer the isolated multiple-choice
questionswithoutanyoccupationalorgenderinformationadded,seeExampleprompt5.1. Wedenote
this Baseline 1.
Example Prompt 5.1 Parents bring an 11-month-old baby to the clinic because the baby has
a fever of 39.0°C (102.2°F). The baby is irritated and crying constantly. She is up to date
on immunizations. A complete physical examination reveals no significant findings, and all
laboratory tests are negative. Five days after resolution of her fever, she develops a transient
maculopapular rash. What is the most likely diagnosis?
A) Roseola B) Erythema infectiosum C) Rubella D) Kawasaki disease Which
answer is correct?
The 14 medical questions are tested 30 times, yielding a relative error of 0.24, seen in Equation(8).

male group, while the FPR is highest in the female. This reflects a tendency to connect the pronoun
she withnurse,andthepronounhe withdoctor. Saiddifferently,counter-stereotypicalexamples(male
nurse and female doctor) causes model performance to decrease. To evaluate sufficiency we consider
the positive/negative predictive values (PPV/NPV) in Table 2. The predictive values are the ratio
of true positives/negatives to predicted positives/negatives, respectively. We have PPV=1 for males,
which means that when the model identifies the doctor as right, it is always the true answer. When
comparing this observation to the NPVs, which is relatively low, it illustrates that the model has an
overconfident tendency to consider the doctor as correct.
5.4 AssessingseparationandsufficiencyII:Occupationalgender-stereotypes
are reinforced across sectors
We test the model using prompts generated from the six Template Prompts 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 4.7, and
4.8. Experimentsusingeachtypeofpromptarereplicated50timesperpronoun. Table6presentsthe

30 test runs are presented in Table 3.
When the prompt does not contain gendered pronouns, the model correctly associates the job
to the work assignment, generating the same correct response in every test run. When introducing
pronouns, the model changes behaviour and its outputs reflect prevailing stereotypes. Table 6 shows
how the model is unable to associate the work assignment of the pilot when a female pronoun is used,
and contrarily unable to connect a male pronoun to the flight attendant. To put this in the context
of separation and sufficiency, we compare false positive/negative rate and positive/negative predictive
valuesaccordingtothepartitioningaccordingtoEquation (5)and(6), theresultsareshowninTable

6 A comparison across GPT models
To gain insight into potential fairness developments of models over time, we repeat our second inde-
pendenceexperiment(section4.2)forthreedifferentGPTmodels: GPT-3.5-turbo,releasedNovember
2022; GPT-4, released March 2023; and GPT-4-turbo, released November 2023. We obtain popula-
tions of 2160 model outputs from GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4-turbo, retrieved by prompting replicates
ofTemplateprompt(4.2). Tocomparethethreedistributions,wetrainaWord-2-Vec[6]modelonthe
data from all three experiments. To measure the gender polarity between outputs describing hobbies
for male and female names, we calculate gendered sentence scores for each model output as follows:
The position vector representing the embeddings of the words ’she’ and ’he’ are denoted ⃗f and
m⃗, respectively. We draw a segment line between⃗f and m⃗. The midpoint of the segment is denoted β.
The vector extending from β in direction of ⃗f is denoted ⃗a. The word distributions returned from
the template prompts are stripped from stop words, and for every word w, a displacement vector is
drawn from β to the coordinates of w’s embedding, denoted w⃗. A comparative value is computed for
every word as the scalar projection of w⃗ onto⃗a. The scalar projection of a word w⃗ is denoted s , and
w
is computed as seen in Equation (9):
s =∥w⃗ ∥cosθ =w⃗ ·aˆ (9)
w
Sinceprojectionsaremirroredatthemidpointbetween⃗fandm⃗, aninverserelationshipisensured,
suchthataword’sprojectionontotheunitvectorpointingtowardsm⃗ equalsthenegativeoftheword’s
projection onto f⃗. Words with strong female connotations will yield positive projections, while words
with strong male connotations will yield negative projections. We calculate the sentence scores for
each model output, as the mean scalar projection of words present in the output. Figure 5 depicts the
average sentence score across all male and female names for the three different GPT versions.
We compute, for each of the three models, both the p-value corresponding to a Mann-Whitney
U-test between the male and female populations (they are not normally distributed) as well as the
effect size represented by Cohen’s d. The p-values and effect size values are found in Figure 5. We
observe, first of all, that the male and female mean sentence scores are significantly different in each
modelpopulation. Wealsoobservethatthesedifferencesincrease–bothasquantifiedbyp-valuesand
effect sizes – between GPT 3.5-turbo and the later GPT 4 and GPT 4-turbo.

not what we find. Indeed, we see that the bias increases from GPT 3.5-turbo to the later GPT 4 and
GPT 4-turbo.
7 Discussion and conclusion
In this paper we propose methods for measuring gender-bias in generative language models, trough
reinterpretationofthenon-discriminationcriteriaforclassification. Wedemonstratehowthesecriteria

With this work we only touch upon language model, but the proposed newly interpreted non-
discrimination criteria can be adapted to other generative AI models of other media. This will involve
forming a mapping of model outputs to reasonable categorical variables. Our experiments document
bias in GPT models, which reflect issues with occupational gender-stereotypes. As seen in Figure
