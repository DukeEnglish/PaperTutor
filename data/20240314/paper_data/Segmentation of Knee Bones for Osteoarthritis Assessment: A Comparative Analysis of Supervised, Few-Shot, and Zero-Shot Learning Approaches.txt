Abstract. Knee osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that induces
chronic pain and disability. Bone morphological analysis is a promising tool to
understand the mechanical aspect of this disorder. This study proposes a 2D
bone morphological analysis using manually segmented bones to explore
morphological features related to distinct pain conditions. Furthermore, six
semantic segmentation algorithms are assessed for extracting femur and tibia
bones from X-ray images. Our analysis reveals that the morphology of the
femur undergoes significant changes in instances where pain worsens.
Conversely, improvements in pain may not manifest pronounced alterations in
bone shape. The few-shot-learning-based algorithm, UniverSeg, demonstrated
superior segmentation results with Dice scores of 99.69% for femur and
99.60% for tibia. Regarding pain condition classification, the zero-shot-
learning-based algorithm, CP-SAM, achieved the highest accuracy at 66%
among all models. UniverSeg is recommended for automatic knee bone
segmentation, while SAM models show potential with prompt encoder
modifications for optimized outcomes. These findings highlight the
effectiveness of few-shot learning for semantic segmentation and the potential
of zero-shot learning in enhancing classification models for knee osteoarthritis
diagnosis.

1 Introduction
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic joint disease associated with gradual deterioration of
articular cartilage [1]. Currently, about 6.7% of the global population is impacted by
OA, with knee being the most vulnerable site [2]. Projections indicate a 74.9%
increase in knee OA incidence by 2050, leading to a substantial rise in the demand for
patient care within this population [2, 3]. The manifestation of knee OA is
heterogeneous, but it typically involves chronic knee pain, joint stiffness, reduced
range of motion, and loss of locomotive function. General imaging biomarkers of OA
comprise articular cartilage damage, osteophyte formation, sclerosis of the
subchondral bone, and the development of subchondral cysts [1]. These imaging
indicators collectively highlight that the primary site of knee OA is situated in the
articulation between the femur and tibia bones.
Knee compartment resembles a hinge-like component that is fundamentally driven
by mechanical processes and marked by continuous bone remodeling. The dynamic
nature of bone remodeling further emphasizes bone shape as a prospective imaging
indicator for OA [4]. Alterations in bone shape or geometry have the potential to
influence load distribution within the joint, potentially leading to worsened OA pain
or improved OA pain.In this paper, a simple 2D bone morphological analysis is proposed using manually
segmented bones to investigate the morphological characteristics associated with
different pain conditions. Furthermore, a deep learning model is proposed for
automatic segmentation of knee bones in X-ray images, which can be used as a tool
to assist the diagnosis of knee OA. Lastly, the segmentation model is integrated into
a classification model for pain condition classification.
Our paper is structured as follows: After the introduction of research background
in Section I, Section II provides an overview of related works. Section III describes
the database and proposed algorithms. Next, Section IV discusses the experimental
findings. Lastly, Section V concludes the study.
2 Related Work
Semantic segmentation is a fundamental aspect of bone morphological analysis [5, 6].
It involves the process of isolating the entire bone pixels from raw images. Traditional
bone segmentation approaches rely on image processing techniques that recognize
low-level features, such as edges, shapes, and pixel intensities [7]. A notable limitation
in this domain is the incapacity of a single model to universally accommodate all
cases, given that bone structure is subject- specific and not generalized.
Deep learning has leveraged the segmentation procedure through increased
computational capabilities, allowing high-level features to be extracted. The
integration of a statistical shape model (SSM) into a CNN has been employed to
extract the bone surface from imaging data [8, 9]. V-Net encoder- decoder architecture
has been commonly used for bone segmentation from MRI images [4]. Bone trajectory
analysis becomes feasible with the execution of bone morphological assessments at
various time points. Calivá, et al. [4] pioneered a contrastive learning-based deep
learning pipeline designed to forecast longitudinal changes in bone shape, specifically
focusing on the femur, over a span of 72 months. However, the data acquisition for
this study is challenging, as it necessitates multiple MRI images to be taken over time.
Two research gaps are identified based on previous works. Firstly, most proposed
algorithms are grounded in supervised learning, assuming there is enough labeled data
available for model training. However, these algorithms still struggle to overcome the
challenges posed by OA studies with limited labeled data. Consequently, few-shot
learning and zero-shot learning emerge as promising deep learning approaches for
analyzing datasets with sparse labels. Secondly, despite the higher resolution offered
by MRI, it is infrequently used in clinical practice for knee OA diagnosis due to cost
constraints. Instead, X-ray imaging remains the most accessible imaging option for
confirming OA disease. Considering these two factors, our study will specifically
focus on applying few-shot learning and zero-shot learning techniques to X-ray
images.
3 Database and Methods
3.1 Database
The data used for this study is anteroposterior knee X-ray images from Osteoarthritis
Initiative (OAI) database [10], which is publicly available at https://nda.nih.gov/oai/.
Manual annotations were performed on 606 images to delineate the tibia and femur
bones. Pain change over the subsequent 12 months was computed by analyzing the
patient self-reported pain scale at baseline and 12 months. Pain increments of 2 were
categorized as worsened pain, while pain decreases of 2 were deemed indicative of
improved pain.
All images were resized into 640 x 640 pixels. The bone contour was identified
from the mask images using marching squares algorithm [11]. Each bone shape was
computed using circularity and eccentricity indices. Circularity evaluates how round
the bone shape is, and it is defined as:𝐶𝑖𝑟𝑐𝑢𝑙𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑦= 4𝜋 × 𝐴𝑟𝑒𝑎 (1)
𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑚𝑒𝑡𝑒𝑟2
where Area is the area of segmented bone and Perimeter is the perimeter of segmented
bone.
Eccentricity quantifies how much the bone shape deviates from a perfect circle,
and it is defined as:
𝐸𝑐𝑐𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑦
=√1−(𝑏 )2
(2)
𝑎
where α represents the length of the semi-major axis and b represents the length of the
semi-minor axis. The value of eccentricity ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 corresponds to
a perfect circle, and 1 corresponds to a line segment.
The data was divided into a training set (536 images), a validation set (45 images),
and a test set (25 images).
3.2 Model Architectures
In this study, six segmentation models were employed: Res-UNet, DeepLabV3Plus,
SegFormer, UniverSeg, bounding box-based segment anything (BBOX-SAM), and
central point- based segment anything (CP-SAM).
3.3 Supervised Learning
Res-UNet, DeepLabV3Plus, and SegFormer are models that rely on supervised
learning. Res-UNet (total params: 2.06M) is an encoder-decoder model, where the
encoder consists of three blocks, each employing 3x3 depthwise separable
convolutions, followed by batch normalization and residual connections. The decoder
comprises four convolutional layers with transposed convolutions, batch
normalization, ReLU activation, upsampling layers, and residual connections. Unlike
Res-UNet, DeepLabV3Plus [12] (total params: 11.8M) utilizes multi-scale features
yielded by the last convolutional block before upsampling. This operation is
implemented by atrous spatial pyramid pooling layers. Our DeepLabV3Plus uses
ResNet50 as a backbone model. SegFormer [13] (total params: 3.72 M) is a
transformer-based segmentation model that utilizes self-attention mechanism. All
three models were trained using pixel-wise sparse categorical cross-entropy loss
function 𝐿 defined as:
𝑝𝑖𝑥𝑒𝑙−𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑒−𝑠𝑝𝑎𝑟𝑠𝑒
𝐿 (𝑃,𝑌)=−1 ∑𝑁 𝑙𝑜𝑔 (𝑃 ) (3)
𝑝𝑖𝑥𝑒𝑙−𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑒−𝑠𝑝𝑎𝑟𝑠𝑒 𝑁 𝑖=1 𝑖,𝑌𝑖
where P is probability distribution, Y is ground truth label, N is the total number of
pixels, Y is the number of classes, P is the predicted probability of pixel i belonging
i i,Yi
to the true class.
3.4 Few-Shot Learning
UniverSeg [14] (total params: 1.18M) is a few-shot learning model that employs a
cross-block mechanism to facilitate feature transfer between the support set and the
query image. This mechanism adopts an encoder-decoder architecture, where the
encoder path consists of multiple levels of CrossBlock and spatial down-sampling
operations applied to both the query and support set representations. Conversely, in
the expansive path, each level incorporates up-sampling for both representations,
effectively doubling their spatial resolutions. The resulting up-sampled
representations are then concatenated. Lastly, a single 1x1 convolution is applied to
map the ultimate query representation to a prediction. In this study, we initiated bone
segmentation on the test set by randomly selecting 31 image-mask pairs from the
training set to serve as a support set.3.5 Zero-Shot Learning
Segment Anything (SAM) [15] (total params: 632M) is a transformer-based zero-shot
learning model that can be integrated with a customized prompt encoder for
segmenting specific objects of interest. The model has been trained on SA- 1B dataset.
The notable advantage of this model is its training- free nature. In this study, we
developed two prompt encoders: bounding box (BBOX) and central point (CP) (Fig.
1) using AutoML in Roboflow Train 3.0 technology.

point prompt encoder.
3.6 Classifiers and Evaluation Metrics
The classifier for segmentation models is a multilayer perceptron (MLP), while the
classifier for categorizing pain conditions is the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm.
Quantitative evaluation was performed on test set using five metrics, namely
accuracy (Acc), precision, recall, Dice score, and Intersection over Union (IoU)
derived from true positive (TP), true negative (TN), false positive (FP), and false
negative (FN):

4 Results
The circularity and eccentricity of femur and tibia bones were computed based on the
contour constructed from the masks (Fig. 2). The circularities exhibited variations but
generally remained consistent across categories for both bones (Fig. 3(a)). In terms of
eccentricity (Fig. 3(b)), both femur and tibia showed a decrease in mean values for the
"Worsened pain" category, indicating a shift towards a more circular shape. Femur
exhibited a more noticeable decrease, suggesting a pronounced change in bone
morphology. In contrast, the tibia showed a slight increase in mean eccentricity for
the "Improved pain" category. These findings suggest that bone morphology,
particularly in the femur, undergoes notable changes in cases where pain worsens,
while improvements in pain might not exhibit pronounced alterations in bone shape.
Based on the segmentation outcomes of femur bones (Table 1), UniverSeg
achieved the highest accuracy (99.50%), IoU (99.37%), and Dice score (99.69%),
demonstrating superior performance in accurately delineating bone regions. BBOX-
SAM and DeepLabV3+ also exhibited strong segmentation outcomes, with accuracies
of 97.40% and 98.90%, respectively. However, UniverSeg surpassed them in terms of
IoU. In contrast, CP-SAM lagged behind in accuracy (91.12%) and IoU (89.71%),despite achieving the highest precision (99.70%).

change, red line signifies bone with worsened pain in the next 12 months, and green line
indicates bone with improved pain in the next 12 months.

For segmentation of tibia bones (Table 2), UniverSeg emerged as the top performer
with the highest accuracy (99.53%), IoU (99.20%), and Dice score (99.60%).
DeepLabV3+ and SegFormer also demonstrated robust segmentation, with
accuracies above 98%, IoU scores above 95%, and Dice scores above 97%. CP-SAM,
while showing lower accuracy (96.46%), maintained a respectable IoU (87.20%).
These findings underline UniverSeg's consistent excellence, especially in capturing
the intricate details of bone structures.
Qualitative assessment has been performed (Fig. 4). Res- UNet and SegFormer
misidentified the screw on the femur bone as the tibia bone, suggesting that these
models are less sensitive to visual artifacts caused by implants. The segmentation
quality of BBOX-SAM and CP-SAM was notably influenced by the prompt. In
BBOX-SAM, bone segmentation tended to exclude the screw. In CP-SAM,
segmentation focused on the point specified in the prompt, and as most central points
were in the screw pixel, only the screw part was segmented.
The segmented masks for femur and tibia bones were categorized according to
pain conditions using a KNN classifier (Table 3). However, due to the limited dataset
size and highly imbalanced class distribution, our classification model exhibited
limited effectiveness, achieving an accuracy of only about 52% using ground truth
masks. When the classification model was integrated with the segmentation model,
only UniverSeg and CP-SAM showed improvements in the classification outcomes
by 8% and 14%, respectively.
Given the superior performance of UniverSeg in segmenting bone pixels from X-
ray images and its capability to enhance classification model performance, we
recommend UniverSeg as the solution for automatic knee bone segmentation.
However, the potential of SAM models should not be overlooked, as the prompt
encoder can be modified and integrated with domain knowledge to further improve
segmentation and classification outcomes.

In this study we have demonstrated a 2D bone morphological analysis, compared the
segmentation capability of six deep learning algorithms, and illustrated how the
segmentation model can enhance the classification model. Despite the limited image
dataset, the proposed model exhibited effective segmentation results. This model
serves as a promising solution in advancing a fully automated diagnostic tool for knee
OA. In our future work, we aim to develop an end-to-end algorithm to automatically
(i) segment knee bones in MRI sequences, (ii) construct the bone structure into 3D
geometry, and (iii) predict the progressive bone changes induced by subject-specific
mechanical load.
