Multi-robot connection towards collective obstacle
field traversal
Haodi Hu, Xingjue Liao, Wuhao Du, Feifei Qian
Abstract—Environments with large terrain height variations achieve versatile and adaptive environment interactions and
present great challenges for legged robot locomotion. Drawing collectively traverse a wide variety of extreme terrains.
inspiration from fire ants’ collective assembly behavior, we
study strategies that can enable two “connectable” robots to
collectively navigate over bumpy terrains with height variations
larger than robot leg length. Each robot was designed to be
extremely simple, with a cubical body and one rotary motor
actuating four vertical peg legs that move in pairs. Two or
more robots could physically connect to one another to enhance
collective mobility. We performed locomotion experiments with

distributed semi-spherical “boulders”. Experimentally-measured

behavior (e.g., 5.0cm and 6.0cm, Fig. 4a, c).
C. Collective traversability is governed by the direction of
transition between jamming states
To understand how connection length affects the duration
of the “flowing phase”, we investigated two questions in
this section: (i) what is the condition for robots to switch
from collective flowing to collective jamming? (ii) how is
the duration of the flowing phase related to the jamming
condition?
To determine the jamming condition, we analyzed the
experimentally-tracked leg-terrain contact position when the
connectedrobotshiftedfromtheflowingphasetothejamming
phase. We found that during the jamming phase, all robot
legs were located within proximity (≤ 0.8cm) of the obstacle
edge (Fig. 5). We hypothesized that it was governed by the
robot-terrain coupling. Due to the relatively low frictional
coefficient (µ = 0.08) between robot legs and obstacles, the
robot state (position and orientation) within the world frame
was primarily driven by the gravitational forces. Depending
on the connection length, the connected robots would couple
withthesameterraindifferentlyandreachthelowestpotential
energy state at different positions (which we refers to as
the “jamming state” in the remaining of the paper). These
jamming states thus determine the switching condition for the
robots to shift from the flowing phase to the jamming phase.
To relate the duration of flowing phase to the jamming Fig.5. Experimentally-measuredrobotlegscontactpositionswhenthecon-

To identify the jamming states, we computed the total leg-

From those, we further selected states that map to themselves
after a full stride cycle following the method from [26] to
identify the jamming states.
Increasing length
For determining collective traversability, we computed the
energy landscape (Fig. 7, Fig. 8) for each feasible connection
length, and checked the velocity vector direction at each
jamming state. If the product of the velocity vector of the

V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we investigated how collective traversability
of a two-robot system was affected by their physical connec-
tion configurations. We found that with different connection
length, the two-robot system could produce either collective
advancing or collective jamming when coupled with uneven
terrain features. Through a energy landscape based model, we
revealedhowthecollectivetraversabilitywasgovernedbythe
robot-terraincoupling,andmodulatedthroughinter-robotcon-
nection. This understanding allowed the two-robot system to
useanextremelysimplecontroltoadapttheirconnectionsand
successfullymoveacrossdifferentuneventerrainfeatures.TheJOURNALOFLATEXCLASSFILES,VOL.14,NO.8,AUGUST2021 7
