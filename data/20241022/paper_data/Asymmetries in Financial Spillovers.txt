Financial shocks, such as the one observed during the global financial crisis, exhibit important
domesticandinternationalconsequencesonmacroeconomicaggregates(see,e.g.,Dovernandvan
Roye,2014;Ciccarellietal.,2016;Prietoetal.,2016;Gerbaetal.,2024). Policymakersincentral
banks and governmental institutions, who aim to smooth business cycles and thus alleviate the
negative effects of adverse financial disruptions, need to understand how such shocks impact the
economy and propagate internationally to implement policies in a forward-looking manner.
The recent literature provides plenty of evidence on the domestic and international effects
of US financial shocks (see Balke, 2000; Gilchrist and Zakrajˇsek, 2012; Cesa-Bianchi and Sokol,
2022). These papers find that financial shocks exert powerful effects on domestic output but
also that US-based shocks spill over to foreign economies and trigger declines in international
economic activity. Such effects might be subject to time variation (Abbate et al., 2016). Some
other recent papers use nonlinear techniques, and estimate that the transmission of financial
shocks to the real economy is asymmetric, with contractionary shocks having a much stronger
effect than benign shocks (see Barnichon et al., 2022; Mumtaz and Piffer, 2022; Forni et al.,
2024). This evidence, however, is mostly based on using closed-economy empirical models and
factors out whether (and how) financial shocks transmit internationally in a nonlinear way.
Nonlinear models that are capable of disentangling benign from adverse shocks are mainly
confined to the single country case. The main reason is that even in the bi-country case, the
number of time series is doubled and this raises computational and statistical issues. The
inclusion of more countries (or more domestic series) exacerbates these issues and standard
techniques may cease to work properly. Moreover, teasing out nonlinearities in macroeconomic
relationsishardsincetheresearcherneedstoadoptaspecificmodeltocapturenonlinearfeatures
in the data. Mainly for these reasons, the literature on asymmetries in the spillovers of financial
shocks is sparse (for a recent exception, see Abbate et al., 2016).
In this paper, we fill this gap by providing new evidence on asymmetries in the spillovers of
US-based financial shocks to two major economies: the Euro Area (EA) and the United King-
dom (UK). To do so, we develop a nonlinear multi-country model that is capable of producing
differently shaped impulse responses to financial shocks with respect to the size and the sign
of the shocks. Our model assumes that the different equations and country blocks depend on
its lags in a potentially highly nonlinear way and we approximate this using recent advances in
Bayesian machine learning.
We formulate and test two hypotheses about the international effects of US financial shocks.
First, we investigate the hypothesis that US financial shocks need to exceed a certain size to
2trigger a meaningful response from foreign economies. Second, we hypothesize that benign
financial shocks trigger no meaningful international spillovers. Standard linear models such
as vector autoregressions (VARs) cannot analyze these hypotheses since impulse responses are
symmetric regarding shock size and sign.
Both hypotheses have substantial policy implications, and our model, being nonlinear and
quite flexible, allows us to drill deeper into how central banks should react to different financial
shocks. We do so by backing out the implied reaction function of the central bank, paying
particular attention to differences in the responses of shadow rates (as a broad measure of the
monetary policy stance) to shock size, sign but also the period in which the US-based shock has
happened.
Our empirical results confirm both hypotheses. Specifically, in terms of domestic US dy-
namics in response to financial shocks, there is clear evidence of asymmetric responses due to
the sign and size of the shocks, more for the former than for the latter. Moreover, we find that
financial shocks originating in the US economy spill over to the EA and the UK, and these
spillovers materialize most prominently in financial variables. Benign financial shocks are some-
what more stable over time and result in modest improvements in real economic activity, than
adverse shocks, which have a far stronger and more unpredictable influence. Finally, central
banks are much more reactive and dynamic in adjusting monetary policy during adverse shocks
compared to benign shocks, suggesting that policy interventions are more frequent and varied
when addressing economic headwinds and downside risk.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. The next section introduces the econo-
metric framework, a multi-country vector additive smooth transition (VAST) model, and briefly
sketches priors, how we simulate from the joint posterior of the parameters, and structural iden-
tification of the US financial shock. Then, Section 3 discusses the dataset and further details
about model specification. Section 4 deals with asymmetries in the domestic reactions to US
financial shocks while Section 5 investigates with their international spillovers. Section 6 dis-
cusses whether shock propagation changes over time and backs out policy reaction functions.
The last section summarizes and concludes the paper.
2 Econometric framework
Our goal is to understand whether financial shocks trigger asymmetric international reactions.
These asymmetries could arise from differences in how benign and adverse financial shocks
impact the economy, but also from the effects of larger relative to smaller shocks, the former
potentially leading to disproportionally larger reactions of macroeconomic and financial series
3of interest. Answering such questions calls for nonlinear models, because conventional linear
multivariate time series models such as VARs, by construction, result in exactly symmetric
responses.
2.1 A nonlinear multi-country model
We investigate these issues through the lense of a nonlinear panel VAR (PVAR). Typically,
PVARs are linear models with time-invariant coefficients (see, e.g., Canova and Ciccarelli, 2013;
Koop and Korobilis, 2016). There are also nonlinear PVARs that assume time-varying parame-
ters (e.g. Canova and Ciccarelli, 2009; Billio et al., 2016). These models, however, are still linear
in the parameters conditional on a particular point in time. Hence, asymmetries of the form we
are interested in are difficult to capture.
We set the stage by letting y denote an M -dimensional vector of country-specific macroe-
it i
conomic and financial time series for countries i = 1,...,N. In our case, the countries are
the US, the UK, and the EA. Stacking these variables yields an M-dimensional vector Y =
t
(y′ ,...,y′ )′, where M = (cid:80)N M . We assume that Y depends on X = (Y′ ,...,Y′ )′
1t Nt i=1 i t t t−1 t−P
through the nonlinear stochastic relationship:
Y = F(X )+ε , ε ∼ N(0 ,Σ), (1)
t t t t M
where F : RK → RM is a possibly nonlinear and unknown function that takes a K = MP-
dimensional input and maps it into the conditional mean of Y . The shocks in ε are ho-
t t
moskedastic and feature a full M ×M-dimensional covariance matrix Σ.1
Our key inferential object in the context of tracing asymmetric transmission is to estimate
the unknown function F. We approximate it using a sum of R simple functions g(•) as in Huber
(2023). Formally, this implies that:
R
(cid:88)
F(X ) ≈ g(X |ϑ ) (2)
t t r
r=1
with ϑ denoting a small dimensional vector of parameters that determine the shape of this
r
function. We will set g(X |ϑ ) as follows:
t r
g(X |ϑ ) = β S +(1−S )β . (3)
t r 0r rt rt 1r
1The proposed framework isstill capable ofcapturing heteroskedastic data features through thedesign of the
conditional mean functions. Specifically, observations are clustered over time to feature heterogeneous intercepts
with potentially different variances, see Eq. (3), which is similar in spirit to regression tree-based approaches. In
this context, using a dataset for the US similar to ours, Clark et al. (2023) document that explicitly assuming
heteroskedastic errors is by and large an unimportant model feature.

This logistic function implies that if ϕ is large, S behaves like an indicator function that

t
hence is called a “weak learner” in the machine learning literature (Schapire, 1990; Chipman
et al., 2010). Taken together, the function-specific parameters are ϑ = (β′ ,β′ ,ϕ ,µ ,δ )′.

2.2 Priors and posterior simulation
Following Huber (2023), we use the following prior on the unknowns of the model:
R
(cid:89)
p(Σ)p(β|Σ) (p(δ )p(µ )p(ϕ )). (5)
j j j
r=1
5We use a conjugate Normal-inverse Wishart prior on p(β|Σ) and Σ (for a textbook discussion,
see Koop and Korobilis, 2010):
p(β,Σ) = NW−1(v,S,β,V ).
β
where v are prior degrees of freedom, S denotes an M ×M prior scaling matrix, β is a prior
mean vector of dimension 2R and V is a 2R×2R prior covariance matrix. Notice that this
β
prior specification implies that the conditional prior of β given Σ is:
β|Σ ∼ N(β,Σ⊗V)
and thus features a Kronecker structure similar to the one in the likelihood function condi-
tional on our approximating model. We exploit this structure for substantial computational
improvements.
The hyperparameters are set as follows. We set the prior degrees of freedom equal to M.
This choice ensures that the prior is proper. Then, we set S = ξI with ξ = 0.01. Finally,
M
β = 0 and V = 1/JI . This choice is inspired by the prior used in Chipman et al. (2010)
2R
and implies that if J is large, each basis coefficient is shrunk stronger towards zero; thus, the
corresponding base function, in machine learning terms, acts as a weak learner.
The priors on the parameters governing the transition function are independent across func-
tions r = 1,...,R, and equipped with uninformative priors. On δ we assume that the prior
r
probability that a particular element equals 1 is 1/K. On µ we use a Gaussian prior with mean
r
zero and variance 102. This choice is relatively uninformative and implies that, if the elements
in X are standardized, we force the thresholds equal to the mean of the time series. On ϕ we
t r
use Gamma prior with shape and rate parameter equal to 0.01. In this case, we also introduce
no substantial prior information on the shape of the transition functions.
Combining the prior with the likelihood gives rise to the posterior distribution. In our case,
thejointposteriorforallunknownsofthemodeltakesnosimpleandwell-knownform. Hence,we
needtoresorttoMarkovchainMonteCarlo(MCMC)techniquestocarryoutposteriorinference.
Here, we briefly sketch the main steps involved and refer the more technically interested reader
to Huber (2023).
In brief, we first sample δ conditional on the other base functions but marginally of β and
r
Σ from its discrete posterior distribution. Conditional on δ we sample µ and ϕ in a block
r r r
using a random walk Metropolis Hastings (MH) update. These two steps determine the shape
of the transition function S . We repeat this for r = 1,...,R. Once we have obtained estimates
rt
6of all transition functions the model reduces to a seemingly unrelated regression model and we
can sample Σ from an inverse Wishart posterior distribution and β conditional on Σ from a
Gaussian distribution.
The sampler mixes rapidly. This is because in the steps that rely on MH updating we do
not condition on Σ and β whereas for the other steps, we have well-known full conditional
distributions. In our application, we repeat the algorithm to obtain 30,000 draws from which
we discard the initial 15,000.
2.3 Structural identification and nonlinear dynamic responses
RecallthatthemodelpresentedinEq. (1)takestheformofaVARwithanunknownconditional
mean function. A conventional linear VAR is nested when setting F(X ) = AX where A is
t t
an M ×K matrix of dynamic VAR coefficients. Further, it is worth noting that the reduced-
form shocks in both variants play an identical role — any established VAR-based identification
strategy to recover the structural shocks is applicable. Specifically, we may achieve structural
identification of the shocks by uniquely decomposing the reduced-form covariance matrix into
Σ = A−1A−1′, and we then have ε = A−1u with u ∼ N(0,I ) encoding the structural
0 0 t 0 t t M
shocks.
Due to the nonlinearities inherent to our model, we rely on generalized impulse response
functions (GIRFs, see Koop et al., 1996) to compute dynamic causal effects. The unscaled
impact response (i.e., at horizon h = 0) to shock j is given by ∂Y /∂u = γ˜ = A−1e where
t jt j0 0 j
e is the jth column of I . Since our focus is on asymmetric effects in response to varying
j M
shock size and sign, we compute scaled impacts such that γ(ς) = ς ·s ·γ˜ /γ˜ where s2 is the
j0 j j0 j,j0 j
unconditional variance of the jth variable in Y and ς is a scale factor of interest.2
t
The dynamic responses to shocks of different signs and sizes can then be recovered from:
γ(ς) = E(Y |u = 1,ς,•)−E(Y |•), (6)
jh,t t+h jt t+h
which is the difference between the expected value of two distinct predictive distributions: one
is conditional on the shock of interest, and the other is the unconditional distribution. These
expectations are obtained through Monte Carlo integration. The one-step-ahead predictive
distributions based on an MCMC draw of F(X ) and Σ are Gaussian with known moments.
t
For each draw in the algorithm, we may thus simulate the shock impact forward across h =
2The variance of the identified structural shocks may differ across linear and nonlinear models. To make the
corresponding impacts comparable, we thus opt for normalizing the shocks first and then rescale them with the

3 Data and model specification
In our analysis, we consider a monthly dataset that spans the period from 1999M1 to 2023M9
and comprises of key macroeconomic and financial time series commonly used in multi-country
macroeconomic models (Scholl and Uhlig, 2008; Feldkircher and Huber, 2016; Georgiadis, 2017;
Bai et al., 2022). We consider three countries jointly. These are the US, the EA, and the UK.
Per country, we analyze the effect of a financial shock in the US on the following seven
variables. Weincludeindustrialproduction(inlogs)tomeasureeconomicactivity, CPIinflation
(in log-differences of the CPI) to capture price dynamics, the shadow rate (in levels) from
Krippner (2013) as a broad gauge of the monetary policy stance. These three series are inspired
by the three-equation New Keynesian model discussed in, e.g., Clarida et al. (1999). We then
add major stock market indices. These are the S&P 500 for the US, the Eurostoxx 50 for the
EA, and the FTSE 100 for the UK. These are included in log levels. Given their importance for
international shock transmission, we add the EUR/USD and the GBP/USD exchange rate (in
logs). They also (partially) account for expectations, given that financial markets are forward-
looking. For each country, we also include 10-year government bond yields as our measure of
long-term interest rates (in levels). Finally, as our preferred measure of financial conditions, we
add the US excess bond premium (EBP) from Gilchrist and Zakrajˇsek (2012). This implies that
M = 19.
Wecollecttheseseriesfromseveralsources. FromFREDwegetUSindustrialproduction,US
and UK CPI inflation, USD/EUR exchange rate, USD/GBP exchange rate, government bond
yields (10-year) for all three economies, and the S&P 500 stock market index. The Statistical
Data Warehouse (SDW) of the ECB provides EA industrial production and HICP inflation as
well as the Eurostoxx 50 stock market index. UK industrial production is taken from the Office
for National Statistics (ONS). The FTSE 100 stock market index is extracted from Macrobond.
We take shadow rates from Krippner (2013) and the US excess bond premium from Gilchrist
and Zakrajˇsek (2012).
8To pin down the structural shocks of interest, we follow the literature on identifying finan-
cial shocks and impose a recursive ordering scheme (see, e.g., Gilchrist and Zakrajˇsek, 2012;
Barnichon et al., 2022). This is operationalized by ordering the variables in Y as follows. The
t
macroeconomic variables and the shadow rates come first, before the EBP, which is followed
by long-term interest rates and the stock market indexes. This structure yields a set of timing
restrictions, such that the slower-moving macroeconomic variables do not react to the financial
shock within the same month, while contemporaneous responses of the financial variables are
permitted. Computationally, we may thus use a simple Cholesky factorization of the reduced-
form covariance matrix Σ = PP′, where P is a lower-triangular matrix. That is, in terms of
the notation in Section 2.3 we have A−1 = P.
0
In what follows, we estimate our nonlinear model using P = 12 lags and set the number
of simple functions to R = 50. As shown by Huber (2023), using a relatively large number
of base learners (between 40 and 50) consistently delivers robust predictive performance in
macroeconomic applications. To compare linear and nonlinear responses, we also estimate a
Bayesian VAR with P = 12 lags and a standard Minnesota prior (Doan et al., 1984; Litterman,
1986).
4 Asymmetries in domestic reactions of the US economy
Our empirical analysis focuses on three economies and specifically aims at capturing the asym-
metric transmission and spillovers of financial shocks. Asymmetry in this context not only refers
to the distinction between domestic and foreign impulses (and subsequent dynamic effects) but
alsotopotentiallyheterogeneouspatternsoverthebusinesscycle. Crucially, weexplicitlymodel
the changing transmission in response to varying the magnitude and direction of the shocks.
That is why, by design, our set of empirical results is high-dimensional, and we will slice these
results along several key dimensions in our discussions.
To start, we first discuss the domestic peak reactions to financial shocks in the next sub-
section. We then move on to considering the full dynamic reactions in Sub-section 4.2.
4.1 Domestic peak reactions to financial shocks
Figure 1 provides a summary across different shock magnitudes and signs in the form of peak
responses, and enables a direct comparison to a linear version of our model. Figures 2 and 3
select two sign and size combinations (benign vs. adverse and small vs. large shocks) and show
the full dynamic responses across horizons. The results shown here are time averages (i.e., while
our framework produces responses for each point in time we abstract from the time dimension

Note: This figure compares the peak response of a linear BVAR with Minnesota prior (in red) and the nonlinear multi-
country model (in black) for each size of the shock (benign/negative and adverse/positive). The dots show the median
peak responses while the error bars give the 16th and 84th percentiles of the posterior distribution. The numbers in the

in this section).
Figure 1 collects the peak responses of the listed variables to financial shocks. Each panel
shows the sign and size of the shock on the x-axis, ranging from negative (benign) 6 to positive
(adverse) 6 standard deviations as measured in terms of the unconditional variance of the EBP.
These magnitudes must be understood in light of historical episodes; the movement of the EBP
during the most extreme months of the global financial crisis corresponds approximately to a
6 standard deviation shift. The peak responses for the nonlinear model are shown as black
points with error bars (marking the 68 percent posterior credible set), whereas those of the
linear BVAR are the red dots with error bars; the numbers refer to the month after the shock
when the peak occurs. Under the imposed linearity in the traditional BVAR, the red responses
are proportional, symmetric, and their peaks are homogeneous. To avoid obscuring the scales
of the responses, we flip the sign of the responses to benign shocks. In case these responses are
significant, this procedure thus results in a perfect V-shape (or inverted V-shape) across signs
and sizes in these charts.
From a qualitative perspective (ignoring subtle differences stemming from different shock
signs and sizes for the moment), our results broadly correspond to the literature (see, e.g.,
10Furlanetto et al., 2019). An adverse financial shock causes a substantial fall in stock prices,
significantly decreases economic activity (as measured by industrial production in our case),
and puts downward pressure on prices. These responses coincide with a more accommodative
monetary policy stance (i.e., a decline in the shadow rate), while long-term yields tend to follow
this pattern and shift downwards as well.
When we turn to asymmetries we find some evidence of nonlinear transmission of financial
shocks. In particular, our results point towards larger peak responses of output, the shadow
rate, and bond yields if the shock is positive, while for stock markets the opposite is the case.
Theresultthatcontractionaryshockstriggermuchstrongerreactionsofoutputcorroboratesthe
results of Barnichon et al. (2022), who find that imposing linearity — due to averaging across
positive and negative shocks — attenuates the effects of adverse shocks and exaggerates those
of benign ones. For inflation and the EBP we find more evidence in favor of symmetry. This
materializes in terms of similar timings of the peaks but also in terms of a V-shaped reaction
function shown in the figure.
4.2 Dynamic reactions of US macro series to financial shocks
The preceding way of summarizing our results through peak responses abstracts from more
intricate dynamics across horizons. To provide a more detailed discussion, we proceed with
comparing the effects of benign and adverse shocks first. Figure 2 shows the responses to
a negative (benign, green lines and shades) and positive (adverse, red lines and shades) six
standard deviation shock. For ease of visual comparison, we again flip the sign of the response
to the benign shock and plot the posterior median estimate alongside 68 percent posterior
credible sets.
A few general aspects are worth noting. First, following the precedent set by the established
literature (see, e.g., Gilchrist and Zakrajˇsek, 2012), our identification scheme translates into
zero-impact restrictions for the macroeconomic variables and the shadow rate; the excess bond
premium response is scaled to the shock size of interest on impact, and the long-term yields
plus the stock market are allowed to react contemporaneously. Consistent with our discussions
aboutourfirstsetofresults, theresponsesofthefinancialvariablespeakatshorthorizons, while
the macroeconomic aggregates take some time to respond. Second, this chart again exhibits
significant evidence in favor of asymmetries, especially at shorter horizons. In most cases,
credible sets overlap after a few months, but there are distinct patterns (i.e., a lack of overlap),
especially for industrial production and some of the financial variables.
More specifically, we find that the response of the excess bond premium to an adverse

financial shock is much more persistent compared with the benign shock. In the latter case, the
response levels out virtually instantaneously. By contrast, financial conditions remain worse,
compared to the baseline before the shock, for almost half a year in the adverse scenario. In
other words, it takes much longer for the adverse financial shock to dissipate than when the
shock is benign.
This persistence appears to translate into more persistent responses of the other variables as
well. Indeed, economic activity in the benign case reduces only slightly and the response turns
insignificant after only a few months; in the adverse case, effects a much stronger and last a few
months longer. Similar patterns are present for the long-term government bond yield and equity
prices. Bycontrast, thedynamicsofinflationseemmoresymmetric, anddifferencesbetweenthe
two scenarios are not significant. But it is worth mentioning that the posterior median estimate
is nonetheless twice as large in the adverse case.
Asymmetric responses due to financial shocks of different signs have been studied before
(e.g. Barnichon et al., 2022; Mumtaz and Piffer, 2022), so the previous set of results offers
corroborating evidence for earlier papers. Figure 3 now presents novel empirical results for
another type of asymmetry, which is caused by varying the magnitude of the shocks. To save
space and since the adverse shock is arguably the more relevant of the two, we focus on this

comparisons, the large shock response is scaled back ex post to correspond to the one standard
deviation impact (i.e., the dynamics reflect the six standard deviation shock).
All responses in this chart exhibit again the same dynamics we would expect from the
transmissionoffinancialshocks. Zoomingintospecifics,thereisoneclearlesson: whencompared
with the differences in responses due to the signs of financial shocks discussed above, there is
less evidence of asymmetry in the responses when comparing small and large shocks. In fact,
most differences, apart from short-horizon differentials in the response of industrial production,
are statistically insignificant. It is worth mentioning, however, that the posterior medians hint
towardsasomewhatmutedversionoftheresultswediscussedinthecontextofcomparingbenign
and adverse shocks. Put simply, larger shocks cause sharper contractions, and their effects are
more persistent.
Two main results emerge from this discussion of potentially asymmetric domestic dynamics
in response to financial shocks for the US. First, there is clear evidence in favor of asymmetric
responses due to the sign and size of the shocks. This is often not captured, since linear models
mask such heterogeneity with impulse response functions averaging across positive and negative
shocks. Second, the source of the asymmetry can be found more in the sign of the shock than
13its size. Interestingly, comparing benign vs. adverse and small vs. large shocks, we find that an
adverse shock induces a disproportionately large contraction which is more persistent compared
with the benign shock. The same pattern, although somewhat more muted, also emerges as
the shock size increases (i.e., large shocks cause more drastic contractions conditioning on the
adverse scenario, and these effects are even more persistent).
5 International spillovers of US financial shocks
HavingestablishedthatourmodelproducesdomesticUSresponsesinlinewiththeliteratureand
thus provides a suitable laboratory, we now turn to our main research question. Are spillovers
of financial shocks asymmetric? In this section, we begin with a general characterization of the
asymmetric peak effects of macroeconomic and financial variables in the EA and the UK, in
response to a financial shock originating in the US. This discussion is followed by drilling deeper
into common and heterogeneous dynamics of the full dynamic responses in both economies.
5.1 International peak effects of US financial shocks
Our main results on asymmetric spillovers of US shocks to the EA and the UK are presented
in Figure 4 and 5, respectively. Again, like in our discussion of US variables, these are peak
responses (the numbers refer to the month after the shock when the peak occurs) to shocks of
different signs and sizes. The patterns are by and large similar to those in the US domestic case.
Clearly, there are quite significant spillovers when the US is hit by financial shocks. Because the
patterns are in many cases quite similar to the domestic US case, we show the responses across
horizons in Appendix A. It suffices to note that the more persistent effects of large and adverse
shocks in domestic dynamics in many cases also spill over internationally.
Particularly strong effects can be seen in headline stock market indexes for both economies
(the Eurostoxx 50 in the EA and the FTSE 100 for the UK). In virtually all cases the peak
responses occur on impact. By construction, they are thus mostly symmetric for all shocks of
different signs and sizes. A similar picture presents for exchange rates; they mostly peak on
impact or in the month after the financial shock occurred. This is different from the linear
model, where the peak occurs much later (after seven to eight months) and there is much more
posterior uncertainty surrounding a larger median estimate because of that.
Proceedingwithfinancialvariables,weconsidershadowratesnext. Theshadowratescapture
the monetary policy stance of the central banks of both economies, the ECB and the BoE. We
find that they both act more decisively in response to adverse rather than benign shocks which
is reflected in lower shadow rates. And, they do so especially for very large shocks. The same

16pattern can be seen for longer-term yields. For the latter, the peak response of the linear model
differs drastically from the nonlinear one. Considering the results across horizons which are
collected in Appendix A, this is due to an initial increase followed by a substantial rebound
effect; these dynamics are masked by solely focusing on peak responses.
Turning to the macroeconomic variables, we find a key difference between spillovers to the
EA versus those to the UK. Industrial production in the EA exhibits a much more asymmetric
response; intheUKtheresponseis,inalmostallcases,insignificant. Thisdownturnineconomic
activity, however, seems to put modest downward pressure on prices. The effects are borderline
significant in the EA and the UK. To summarize, we find that financial shocks originating in
the US economy spill over to the EA and the UK. In terms of significance, these spillovers
materialize most prominently in financial variables. Another key aspect worth noting is that
the linear version of the model produces very wide credible sets, and the point estimates likely
exaggerate the magnitude of the spillovers. This is due to their inherent linear extrapolation
and symmetry.
6 Time-varying shock propagation and policy responses
Most earlier papers that focused on nonlinear transmission channels of financial shocks investi-
gated time-indexed differentials using various kinds of time-varying parameter (TVP) models.
These approaches range from threshold or Markov switching models (capturing distinct phases
of the business cycle, or regimes determined by a specific variable that signals regime shifts)
to using gradually evolving drifting parameters such as in TVP-VARs. Indeed, our dynamic
responses also vary over time, but so far we have considered solely the sign and size layers of
asymmetry averaged across time.
In this section, we assess patterns of time variation using convenient summary statistics.
We do so to reduce the dimensionality of our results and pick two key variables on which these
statistics will be based. First, we focus on industrial production, which serves as our monthly
measureofeconomicactivity. Thatis,thefinancialshockshavetheiroriginon“WallStreet,”and
these results link their subsequent impact to “Main Street.” Second, we pick the shadow rates,
because these are designed to trace the policy reaction function (reflecting both conventional
and unconventional measures) of the respective central bank. The corresponding results allow
us to investigate the responsiveness of the Fed, ECB, and BoE in the context of important
historical episodes (GFC, European sovereign debt crisis; COVID-19 pandemic), through the
rearview mirror.
176.1 Heterogeneity in peak effects of financial shocks over time
The first set of results for how economic activity, for all three economies, is impacted by
differently-sized adverse and benign financial shocks is presented in Figure 6. For expositional
purposes, we first define “small” and “big” shock sizes. First, we compute the median peak
responses. Second, we present bands of the minimum and maximum peak response, aggregating
across small shocks between 0.1 and 1.5 SDs, and large shocks, ranging from 1.5 to 6 SDs. This
allows peaks to occur at different horizons contingent on the shock. And, crucially, it provides
us with comparatively conservative estimates of the lower and upper bounds of the effects of
financial shocks over time.
Adverse financial shocks, shown in the left-hand-side panels, lead to pronounced contrac-
tions in economic activity. For all three economies, the most severe effects materialize during
the global financial crisis. The UK’s response to adverse shocks is somewhat muted by compar-
ison. Another noteworthy period emerges after the European sovereign debt crisis (with several
episodes of particularly striking simulated downturns in response to large shocks, between 2012
and 2016, the latter coinciding with the Brexit referendum in the UK). Interestingly, adverse
financial shocks induce measurable effects during the COVID-19 pandemic, but other factors
are more important, and compared over time, the peak effects are small.
Turning to benign effects in the right-hand-side panels, the peak responses are much smaller.
While many of the economic episodes we noted above (when discussing adverse shocks) as
exhibitinglargepeakeffectscoincidewithimportantshifts, inthebenigncase, thisisnotalways
the case. This suggests that asymmetric effects are indeed also time-varying. Overall, benign
financial shocks result in more stable but modest improvements in real economic activity, as
indicated by the narrower shaded bands for both shock sizes. These patterns over time further
underline the asymmetry in the economic effects of financial instability, with downside risks
having a far greater and more unpredictable influence on real activity than the potential upside
from more favorable financial conditions.
Figure 7 investigates the peak responses of shadow rates, which we use to measure the
reactions and the monetary policy stance of the three central banks. Recall that negative values
signal a more accommodative (expansionary) stance relative to the non-shock baseline, and
positive values indicate a restrictive response.
Adversefinancialshocksleadtosubstantialandprolongedshiftstowardmoreaccommodative
monetary policy across all three central banks, particularly following large shocks. Different
from the case of economic activity, the magnitudes of the central bank responses are much more
homogeneous across economies.

20The responses to benign shocks tend to be more muted, with much narrower variability
across shock sizes. Compared with the Fed and BoE, the ECB seems to react somewhat less
decisively to benign shocks. The figure thus again illustrates the asymmetric nature, in this case
of monetary policy reactions: while adverse financial shocks trigger aggressive accommodative
measures, benign shocks prompt more modest and less extreme adjustments, with central banks
refraining from significant tightening even in highly favorable financial conditions relative to the
baseline.

In what follows, we compute yet another convenient summary statistic that measures more
specifically the reactiveness of the respective central banks. This approach serves to empirically
measure what we label an “indicator of activeness” in the context of Figure 8. We define
21activeness as the difference between the maximum and minimum peak reaction which we have
discussed in the previous subsection.
Inresponsetoadversefinancialshocks,theactivenessofallthreecentralbanksshowsdistinct

especiallyduringtheCOVID-19pandemic,whereitsresponsesreachtheirpeaklevels,indicating
substantial interventions. The ECB and BoE also exhibit elevated activeness during these

is the elevated activeness between 2010 and 2015, in the aftermath of the European sovereign
debt crisis.
In line with our findings from above, for benign financial shocks, the activeness of all three
central banks is generally lower, with fewer and less pronounced spikes over time. Overall, the

Specifically, we find that adverse shocks trigger much stronger declines in output, inflation, and

size. Besides these two types of asymmetries, we also detect distinct patterns of time variation
in the dynamic responses.
