NOITANICULLAHAMBIGUITY CRITERIA: Ambiguity manifests in diverse forms, including:
- Similar names denoting distinct entities.
- Varied interpretations stemming from insufficient information.
- Multiple understandings arising from vague or unclear information.
Instructions:
- Identify the main SUBJECT within the claim.
- Determine if the SUBJECT is ambiguous according to the provided AMBIGUITY CRITERIA.
- Utilize your world knowledge to enumerate potential DISAMBIGUATIONS for the identified SUBJECT.
- Specify the TYPE of information employed for disambiguation based on the list of DISAMBIGUATIONS.
- If the SUBJECT does not have ambiguous interpretations, return None
- Provide an explanation of the method used to arrive at the final response.
Format your response as a combination of explanation and a dictionary with the following structure:
##EXPLANATION##:
<step-by-step-explanations>
##RESPONSE##:
{"subject": <subject>, "disambiguations":[ <instance-1>, <instance-2>..], "disambiguation_type": <type>}
Example 1:
##CLAIM##: David Heyman, born in 1961 in England, is the founder of Heyday Films.
##EXPLANATION##:
The SUBJECT of the claim is "David Heyman". Based on my world knowledge, there are multiple individuals who share similar names,\
such as "David Heyman - the British film producer" and "David Heyman - the Chairman of the Board of UK HPA." \
To differentiate between them, it is crucial to consider their respective occupations. This criterion offers a \
clearer disambiguation compared to nationality, as both individuals are British and thus nationality alone does not \
provide sufficient distinguishing information.
##RESPONSE##:
{"subject": "David Heyman", "disambiguations": ["David Heyman - British film producer, founder of Heyday Films",\
"David L. Heyman - Chairman of the Board of UK HPA"], "disambiguation_type": "Occupation"}
Example 2:
##CLAIM##: Ruth Bader Ginsburg served as a Supreme Court justice.
##EXPLANATION##:
The SUBJECT is "Ruth Bader Ginsburg". According to my world knowledge, this is a unique individual and I am not aware \
of any other individuals/entities with a similar name. Hence, there are no ambiguous interpretations of this SUBJECT and the claim requires no further disambiguation.
##RESPONSE##:
{"subject": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", "disambiguations": "None"}
Example 3:
##CLAIM##: Charles Osgood, the american television commentator, is best known for hosting CBS News Sunday Morning.
##EXPLANATION##:
The SUBJECT in focus is "Charles Osgood". Based on my world knowledge, there are two notable individuals with similar names: "Charles Osgood - American radio
and television
commentator" and "Charles E. Osgood - American psychologist." Given the ambiguity surrounding the name, \
specifying the individual's profession serves as an apt disambiguation method.
##RESPONSE##:
{"subject": "Charles Osgood", "disambiguations": ["Charles Osgood - American radio and television commentator", \
"Charles E. Osgood - American psychologist"], "disambiguation_type": "Profession"}
Similarly, disambiguate the following claim by detecting the main SUBJECT and disambiguation information for the SUBJECT using your world knowledge. \

14DECONTEXTUALIZATION CRITERIA: Decontextualization adds the right type of information to a CLAIM to make it standalone \
and contain relevant disambiguating information. This process can modify the original CLAIM in the following manners:
- Substituting pronouns or incomplete names with the specific subject being referred to.
- Incorporating the most important distinguishing details such as location/profession/time-period to distinguish the subject from others who might share similar names.
- Should not omit information from the original CLAIM.
Instructions:\
- Use the "subject" and the CONTEXT to substitute any incomplete names or pronouns in the CLAIM.
- Use the "disambiguation_type" and the CONTEXT to resolve ambiguity by adding clarification phrases about the SUBJECT to the claim.
- If information from disambiguation_type is already present in the CLAIM, no decontextualization necessary, return the original claim as is.
Example 1:
##CLAIM:##: He is best known for hosting CBS News Sunday Morning.
##DISAMBIGUATION GUIDELINE##: {"subject": "Charles Osgood", "disambiguation_type": "Occupation"}
##CONTEXT##: Charles Osgood, a renowned American radio and television commentator and writer, was born on January 8, 1933, in the Bronx, New York City. He is
best known for hosting "CBS News Sunday Morning" for over 22 years and "The Osgood File" radio commentaries for over 40 years. Osgood also authored several
books, including "The Osgood Files", "See You on the Radio", and "Defending Baltimore Against Enemy Attack". He was born to Charles Osgood Wood, III and his wife
Jean Crafton, and grew up with five siblings. Osgood graduated from Fordham University in 1954 with a bachelor of science degree in economics.
##EXPLANATION##: The SUBJECT "He" pertains to "Charles Osgood". The DISAMBIGUATION GUIDELINE indicates that there are \
multiple individuals named "Charles Osgood", distinguishable by their occupations. The context clarifies that the \
referenced subject in this claim is Charles Osgood, who is "a renowned American radio and television commentator and \
writer". Opting for minimal disambiguating information, "a commentator" aligns well with the claim concerning hosting \
a news show.
##DECONTEXTUALIZED CLAIM##: Charles Osgood, the commentator, is best known for hosting CBS News Sunday Morning.
Example 2:
##CLAIM:##: Heyman is the founder of Heyday Films.
##DISAMBIGUATION GUIDELINE##: {"subject": "David Heyman", "disambiguation_type": "Occupation"}
##CONTEXT##: David Heyman is a renowned film producer and founder of Heyday Films, known for producing the entire \
"Harry Potter" film series and collaborating with director Alfonso CuarÃ³n on "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban" \
and "Gravity". He was born on July 26, 1961, in London. His family has a background in the film industry, with his parents\
being a producer and actress. Heyman studied Art History at Harvard University and began his career in the film industry\
as a production assistant. Throughout his career, he has received numerous awards and nominations, including an Academy \
Award nomination for Best Picture and a BAFTA Award for Best British Film.
##EXPLANATION##: The SUBJECT "Heyman" refers to "David Heyman". The DISAMBIGUATION GUIDELINE indicates that there are \
multiple individuals named "David Heyman", distinguishable by their occupations. The CONTEXT clarifies that the \
referenced SUBJECT in this claim is Heyman which refers to David Heyman and the subject's occupation is film producer. \
We opt for minimal disambiguating information by adding "a film producer" as a disambiguation for the SUBJECT.
##DECONTEXTUALIZED CLAIM##: David Heyman, the film producer, is the founder of Heyday Films.
Now generate an EXPLANATION and DECONTEXTUALIZED CLAIM for the following. Ensure that \
only minimal information is added to eliminate ambiguity, such as adjusting pronouns or including \
clarifying details. When faced with multiple options for disambiguation under "disambiguation_type," \
prioritize information consistent with the CONTEXT. Avoid repeating information if the claim already \
includes information suggested by the "disambiguation_type."

15DECONTEXTUALIZATION CRITERIA: Decontextualization adds the right type of information to a CLAIM to make it standalone. This process can modify the original CLAIM in the
following manners:
- Substituting pronouns or incomplete names with the specific subject being referred to.
- Including contextual information to provide more context about the subject.
Instructions:- Identify the "subject" of the claim and locate the claim within the context.
- Use the CONTEXT to substitute any incomplete names or pronouns in the CLAIM.
- If there is no decontextualization necessary, return the original claim as is.
- The decontextualization should minimally modify the claim by only adding necessary contextual information.
- Refer to the following examples to understand the task and output formats.
Example 1:
CONTEXT: Almondbury Community School bullying incident: The clip shows the victim, with his arm in a cast, being dragged to the floor by his neck as his attacker says "I'll drown you" on
a school playing field, while forcing water from a bottle into the victim's mouth, simulating waterboarding. The video was filmed in a lunch break. The clip shows the victim walking away,
without reacting, as the attacker and others can be heard continuing to verbally abuse him. The victim, a Syrian refugee, had previously suffered a broken wrist; this had also been investigated
by the police, who had interviewed three youths but took no further action.
CLAIM: The victim had previously suffered a broken wrist.
DECONTEXTUALIZED CLAIM: The Syrian refugee victim in the Almondbury Community School bullying incident had previously suffered a broken wrist.
Example 2:
CONTEXT: Isaiah Stewart: Stewart was born in Rochester, New York. He grew up playing soccer and boxing.

CONTEXT: Arab Serai: According to S.A.A. Naqvi, Mughal emperor Humayun's widow Haji Begum built this "serai" in c. 1560/61 to shelter three hundred Arab mullahs whom she was
taking with her during her "hajj" to Mecca; however, Y.D. Sharma opines that the word Arab in the title is a misnomer as this building was built for the Persian craftsmen and workers who built
the Humayun's Tomb. In January 2017, the Aga Khan Trust for Culture started a project to conserve the "serai". The restoration was completed in November 2018. In March 2019, the trust
announced a planned project to conserve the "baoli" (stepwell) of the serai with the help of funds from the embassy of Germany.
CLAIM: The planned project is to conserve the "baoli" (stepwell) of the serai.
DECONTEXTUALIZED CLAIM: The Aga Khan Trust for Culture's planned project in March 2019 is to conserve the "baoli" (stepwell) of the Arab Serai.

Sheffield on a two-month youth loan deal. He was a prominent figure in the side making six appearances during his loan spell before he was recalled in early January 2016. In February 2016,
he was loaned out again joining National League North side Harrogate Town on a one-month loan deal. After picking up the Player of the Month award for Harrogate during February, his loan
was extended until April. He went on to make a total of eleven appearances for Town. Upon his return to Rotherham in April, he signed a new two-year contract extension until 2018.
CLAIM: He signed a new two-year contract extension until 2018.
DECONTEXTUALIZED CLAIM: Mason Warren Warren signed a new two-year contract extension until 2018 with Rotherham United.

16**Instructions:**
You are provided with information about different individuals who share similar names under "WIKI DISAMBIGUATIONS." Following this, a PASSAGE about one or
more of these subjects is presented. CLAIMS extracted from this passage are then listed.
**Task:**
1. Identify the number of main entities introduced in the passage provided without referring to the WIKI DISAMBIGUATIONS. Determine if the passage describes a
single individual or multiple individuals based on the information given.
2. For a passage that initially seems to describe one person:
- Identify a core fact from the initial description of the entity in the passage that disambiguates this individual from all the entities in the WIKI DISAMBIGUATIONS.
- Use this core fact (such as date of birth, specific educational background, or other unique identifiers) consistently to revise all claims related to that individual until the
passage explicitly introduces a new person with the same name.
3. If the passage explicitly introduces a new person (e.g., stating "There is another person called XYZ"), identify a new core fact about this individual directly from the
passage. Use this core fact to revise all subsequent claims related to this new individual.
4. Consistently apply the selected type of disambiguation (such as profession, birth date, or specific identifier) for each claim about an entity, ensuring all claims about the
same entity are revised uniformly.
5. Make a revision for each claim with consistent disambiguation information added.
**Output Format:**
Think step by step, and finally provide all claim revisions in a structured list format, where each revised claim is clearly matched with its original claim. Each revised
claim should be nested within <revision> tags, ensuring that the chosen method of disambiguation is applied uniformly to all claims about the same entity and that the
revision remains succinct. E.g.
- Claim: <revision> revised-claim </revision>
