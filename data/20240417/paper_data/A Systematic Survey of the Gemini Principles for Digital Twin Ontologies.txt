Ontologies are widely used for achieving interoperable Digital Twins (DTws), yet competing DTw definitions compound interoperability
issues. Semantically linking these differing twins is feasible through ontologies and Cognitive Digital Twins (CDTws). However, it is
often unclear how ontology use bolsters broader DTw advancements. This article presents a systematic survey following the PRISMA
method, to explore the potential of ontologies to support DTws to meet the Centre for Digital Built Britain’s Gemini Principles and aims
to link progress in ontologies to this framework.
The Gemini Principles focus on common DTw requirements, considering: Purpose for 1) Public Good, 2) Value Creation, and 3) Insight;
Trustworthiness with sufficient 4) Security, 5) Openness, and 6) Quality; and appropriate Functionality of 7) Federation, 8) Curation,
and 9) Evolution. This systematic literature review examines the role of ontologies in facilitating each principle. Existing research uses
ontologies to solve DTw challenges within these principles, particularly by connecting DTws, optimising decision-making, and reasoning
governance policies. Furthermore, analysing the sectoral distribution of literature found that research encompassing the crossover of
ontologies, DTws and the Gemini Principles is emerging, and that most innovation is predominantly within manufacturing and built
environment sectors. Critical gaps for researchers, industry practitioners, and policymakers are subsequently identified.

Digital Twins (DTws) are a widespread solution that are beginning to be explored for real-time monitoring, simulation,
and analysis of physical processes across a wide range of distinctive applications. Interoperability, allowing heterogeneous
information for different systems, devices, or applications to work together effectively [1] is required for systems-level
federation; yet, design differences across different DTw applications can hinder interoperability between DTws. One
solution could be the application of ontological methods, which are capable of providing a common representation of data
between different systems. However, embedding ontologies into DTws poses a question, which is explored as the
contribution of this paper; how effectively do applications of ontologies align with existing Digital Twin frameworks,
and how does this compare across different sectoral applications? Answering this question could support evaluation
of ontologies as part of broader DTw evaluation.
DTws originated concurrently from two domains 1) Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) [2] in Industry 4.0 [3], and
2) Building Information Modelling (BIM) from the built environment [4]. The first fully formed concept of DTws was
introduced in Michael Grieves’ 2003 definition, which consists of physical products (the assets a user wishes to digitalise),
virtual products (the digitised models of the assets) and connections (the sensors and tools which link assets to models) [5]
and is acknowledged as an effective baseline definition by many sources [3], [4], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13],
[14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35],
[36], [37], [38], [39]. However, others have suggested limitations of this definition include an over simplification of the
complexity of the structure of DTws [40], a lack of focus on accurately mirroring the physical asset in real time [41] and
little consideration of evolving systems or applications outside of the manufacturing domain [2]. Consequently, other
definitions of DTws have arisen (which are investigated in section 2.1.1).
Such a range of definitions is understandable for DTws within literature, considering their diverse applications. These
applications include a wide variety of use cases including: monitoring assets to detect, diagnose, analyse and manage
changes, anomalies, faults or conflicts in data or parameters; verifying instructions, controlling assets and making
automated decisions; predicting and evaluating hypothetical scenarios to optimise asset or component performance [3],
[9], [11], [16], [40], [42], [43], [44]. Furthermore, whilst many innovations such as Industry 4.0, cyber physical systems,
BIM and UAVs [4], [6], [16], [45], [46], [47] are instanced as individual technologies, DTws could be most valuable as a
common platform synergising with these technologies, data and assets [40], [48]. Whilst DTws seem promising for future
developments, interoperability challenges present themselves as DTws and their capabilities are yet to be fully defined and
agreed upon [40]; the broader concept of a DTw as a physical system providing and using data does seem widely agreed
between sectors, yet literature suggests inconsistency arises as most DTw research is conducted inside sectors, rather than
methodically working with all data across sectors [49]. Since different users and vendors may prioritise different
capabilities, granularities and connections [50], this lack of consensus can lead to conflicting expectations, requirements
and DTw designs [51] (as explored in section 2.1.2).
To address this complexity, the adoption of ontologies is being considered as a potential solution. This approach uses
metadata to map out the relationships between different data sources and assets, in order to create common reference
information linking disparate DTws [8], [9], [37], [43], [52], [53], [54] (and are explained in section 2.2.1). Furthermore,
synergising data and knowledge by integrating ontologies (and Machine Learning) into DTws forms a novel innovation
termed Cognitive Digital Twins (CDTws) [12]. Some literature suggests CDTws may enhance the biggest benefits of a
DTw, to more accurately represents the physical object [18] and to respond and optimise the supply chain with real-time
data [13], [16]. Given the breadth of ML, this paper focusses on the ontological aspects of CDTws (section 2.2.2).
2With such a broad environment of opportunities and applications for DTws, a one-size-fits-all approach to ontologies
may hence be inappropriate, and different approaches may be required for various DTw systems (as detailed in section
2.3.1). As such, a framework approach may be beneficial to identifying the most favourable uses of a DTw in any particular
circumstances. One possible existing framework for evaluating the effectiveness of DTws is the Gemini Principles,
developed by the Centre for Digital Built Britain (CDBB) in 2018, to help businesses develop DTws that can be integrated
into a National Digital Twin (a national ecosystem spanning connected DTws) [55]. This framework encompasses nine
principles: 1) public good, 2) value, 3) insight, 4) security, 5) openness, 6) quality, 7) federation, 8) curation, and 9)
evolution. Detailed explanations of each principle can be found in section 2.3.2.
This section introduces the topics of this paper, followed by an exploration of the rationale (1.1) and justification of the
scope (1.2). Section 2 presents the literature surrounding the issues raised above, providing in-depth discussions of topics
such as “what divergences exist between different Digital Twins?” (2.1), “how can ontologies augment Digital Twins?”
(2.2), and “how can Digital Twins and ontologies be evaluated?” (2.3). Section 3 explains the methodology underpinning
the systematic literature review (3.1), evaluates its suitability (3.2) and reflects on its findings (3.3). Section 4 examines
how ontologies can contribute to each of the nine Gemini Principles across the three Lenses of purpose (4.1), trust (4.2)
and function (4.3), then summarises these considerations (4.4). Finally, Section 5 outlines the gaps in identified research,
policy, and industry (5.1), before concluding and summarising the work (5.2). The Appendix categorises the systematically
reviewed literature by sector and date.
1.1 What is the rationale behind this research?
This work investigates the potential role and applicability of ontologies to support DTws in addressing each Gemini
Principle in turn; doing so could align progress in ontologies with wider DTw innovation and prioritise areas for further
ontology research. Additionally, this paper collates existing research about how ontologies have been considered alongside
one or more Gemini Principle across sectors and time. This aims to both assess existing levels of unconscious alignment
between ontology-driven DTws with the Gemini Principles, and to highlight existing areas of focus or inactivity.
Consequently, this study seeks to emphasise the significance of this research direction, and to map insights and gaps for
future research, policy development, and industry actions to implement ontologies.
This focus seems not to have been directly addressed by existing reviews. D’Amico covered Key Performance
Indicators (KPIs) for CDTws in a maintenance context [6], whilst Ng looked at the context of digital fabrication [56]. Other
systematic reviews have worked within specific sectors of supply chains [57], manufacturing [58], [59], and smart cities
[51], [60], [61], [62], [63], each considering ontologies as part of a suite of solutions. This review takes a more cross-
sectoral approach, linking to a framework to allow evaluation of different lenses with a view to supporting effective and
connected implementation. Such research may become significant with the increased adoption of DTws. These issues may
be particularly relevant now, whilst DTws are still novel and therefore before conflicting and incompatible DTw
approaches become established.
1.2 What is the scope of this review?
This article presents a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to assess the breadth of how ontologies facilitate application
of the Gemini Principles in DTws, and understand research spread across sectors and time. The paper identifies research
gaps and offers recommendations to industry and policymakers. The following research questions are addressed:
31. How could ontologies help Digital Twins in complying with the Gemini Principles? To establish and
consolidate the current state of progress and to identify areas of agreement and debate, so that future work
with ontologies can be more readily compared against the broader DTw landscape.
2. How are publications relating to ontologies and one or more Gemini Principles distributed across
sectors and over time? To understand existing or future evolving research areas and to identify synergy or
progress across sectors, so that future work can identify and action cross-sectoral gaps and learnings.
3. What are the research, policy, and industrial gaps exist that could be addressed by ontologies to
enhance Digital Twin compliance with the Gemini Principles? To identify key areas where ontologies can
improve DTw design and implementations, helping relevant stakeholders to prioritise future work.
2 RESEARCH CONTEXT
The broader research context covered in this review is shown in Figure 1. Fundamentally, literature is divided over how
narrow DTw definitions should be, in regard to the necessity of particular requirements. On one side, some literature
suggests that universal, distinct definitions and conceptualisation can clarify different terms [64], ease data sharing [55]
and aid widespread understanding of what a DTw is [65]. On the other hand, certain literature suggests flexible definitions
prevent unnecessary constraints and instead allow for focus on outcome and purposes [66] as well as cultivating new
perspectives [48]. However, yet another literature viewpoint sees ‘DTw’ as a marketing phrase products are branded with
[4], surrounded by hype and trendy, overused buzzwords that are in reality umbrellas for various innovations [10] which
may already exist under different names [6], [14], [20].
Figure 1: Summary of the research context of this review: definitions of a DTw are explored in 2.1, CDTws and ontologies
in 2.2 and the applicability of the Gemini Principles in 2.3
4Reconciling conflicting DTw perspectives infers that some distinctions may be unnecessary and undesirable [10] but
that terminology should be defined for genuine clarification [10], with the phrase ‘DTw’ cutting across sectors and reducing
silos (where unconnected assets and isolated datasets prevent sharing or collaboration) by replacing sector specific phrases
such as BIM or PLM [6].
2.1 What divergences exist between different Digital Twins?
Additional definitions(s) of DTws may arise or evolve as the topic is viewed from different perspectives [6], [16]. Thus,
futureproofed DTw networks may need capabilities to collaborate with novel DTws developed under evolving definitions.
Yet, meaning may be inconsistent, varying and contradictory even with present definitions [67], [68] which were created
by industry to meet sectoral needs [69] or business requirements [43], using differing protocols and standards [31]. An
expanded version of the Grieves definition discussed in this subsection is shown in Figure 2.
Figure 2: Expanded Grieves definition of a Digital Twin
2.1.1Contextualising Digital Twin requirements – What are the definitions of a Digital Twin?
Literature seems to have largely developed in accordance with Grieves’ definition with some developments converging on
common requirements, and others diverging over new use case applications. These include AMRC’s definition of “a live
digital coupling of the state of a physical asset or process to a virtual representation with a functional output” [70], IBM’s
definition of “a virtual representation of an object or system that spans its lifecycle, is updated from real-time data, and
uses simulation, machine learning and reasoning to help decision making” [71], and CDBB’s definition as “a realistic
digital representation of assets, processes or systems in the built or natural environment” such that data is connected to
the physical object with real-time data from sensors [55]. One study found there are many different definitions, themselves
formed from multiple definitions, and suggests there is no agreement on DTw composition, despite large quantities of
literature [50]. Yet, across these varying DTw definitions are several recurring requirements:
1. Bidirectional mirroring: Literature advises that physical assets and virtual models communicate in both directions
[2], [13], [18], [40], [42], [52] to faithfully echo each other as much as possible [4], [53], [72], [73], [74]. Whilst
technically complex, mirroring may provide critical benefits for DTws [40] by reflecting relationships between
assets and models via coded physical laws, accurate object positioning and a time domain representation [2]. Such
mirroring can emulate a whole asset across its full lifecycle [43], [71] and extend between assets, if inter-DTw
relationships are equivalent to those between the real world assets they represent [64] including hardware and
software dependencies [10]. Conversely, there is division over what level of connection between assets and DTws
is actually needed [50]; for instance, partial DTws called Digital Shadows primarily engage from the physical asset
to digital [24], and could allow interactions from digital to physical to be gradually included as needed [21].
52. Real-time data: Up-to-date DTws expediently depicting real-world assets with real-time data [3], [6], [71], [73],
[75], [76], [77] may be key differentiators of DTws from otherwise static asset models [6] such as BIM or PLM.
Yet, real-time validation, interpretation and use can be challenging [4], particularly for heterogenous data of mixed
origins [37], particularly given the bandwidth needed in sensor channels to guarantee faithful representation in the
DTw of the real world instance at appropriate frequency. Nevertheless, real-time connections may not always be
needed for the whole asset lifecycle, depending on how static (stays the same) or dynamic (is updated) data is [73],
as well as the operation and use case [14]. Indeed, AMRC consider live to mean sufficiently low delay to enable
appropriately real-time decision-making [70].
3. Human-Machine Interaction (HMI): DTws are sociotechnical systems, that can communicate with both users and
other digital systems, including DTws [51], [78], supporting HMI through human and machine readable outputs,
configuration or control settings, and user interfaces [50]. Literature suggests fusing human resourcefulness (for
unique or complex tasks) with machine efficacy (for repetitive or clear tasks) may: improve decision-making, asset
efficiency and quality; reduce failures and make systems respond more proactively to incidents for improved safety;
support user training, and remote work and operation; and allow collaboration across team or sectoral boundaries
[3], [24], [41], [74], [78], [79], [80], [81]. Furthermore, greater efficiency gains may arise as DTws, physical assets
and humans are more linked [82].
Crucially for this work, existing literature indicates that ontologies and Cognitive Digital Twins (CDTws) (which will
be covered later), can meet all three of these requirements [13], [25], [52], [79].
2.1.2 Navigating Digital Twin ambiguity – What is the variation between Digital Twins?
Variation between DTws continues in how assets are linked. Literature suggests most DTws represent a single asset (one-
to-one), and allow isolated modelling of use cases at specific lifecycle stages, rather than representing multiple assets (one-
to-many) in a system of systems [2], [31], [44]. Unsurprisingly, distinct sectoral use cases, scales and lifecycle stages can
hamper cross-sector interoperability and knowledge sharing as a result of discrepancies in: DTw purposes, model priorities,
creation methods and data use; operational challenges in meeting differing time, sector and user needs; and a dissimilarly
structured mix of open-source or commercial solutions for different components [9], [10], [20], [25], [31], [44], [51], [64],
[66], [83].
Indeed, literature suggests DTws may be better suited for asset-heavy industries and complex, multistakeholder
projects, rather than existing single function models (such as BIM or PLM), if they can 1) serve multiple purposes and
functions, 2) process, learn and make data-led decisions from data collected by multiple stakeholders, 3) dynamically adapt
data scales, properties shown, levels of details and complexity, to vary with asset lifecycle stage or user background [16],
[34], [84], [85]. However, linking DTws designed with different purposes in mind could cause issues in: undefined model
boundaries; terminology overlap or inconsistency; and challenges in extracting heterogenous data at high volume and rate
from silos across sectors, stakeholders or lifecycle stages [10], [31], [50], [59], [75], [81].
In the resulting DTw landscape, concepts appear aligned, whilst specific properties, background, language and
frameworks differ, suggesting a need to identify common features and nomenclature for DTws across sectors [2].
2.2 How could ontologies augment Digital Twins?
Whilst thematically similar, these definitions and requirements appear to subtly differ, with potential interoperability issues
in connecting DTws developed from different definitions. Working to both standardise definitions and support nuanced
6differences may seem paradoxical at first, yet literature demonstrates this can be achievable using ontologies. The
relationship between ontologies and CDTws discussed in this subsection is depicted in Figure 3.
Figure 3 Cognitive Digital Twins and ontologies
2.2.1 Structuring Digital Twin data – What are Ontologies?
Philosophically, ontology is a branch of metaphysics which focusses on defining what something is and categorising
objects or concepts to describe characteristics [86]. Similarly, data ontologies (simply ontologies from hereon) collate
metadata (data which describes what data is included) to create a shared understanding of information about an asset.
Relationships and hierarchies between metadata properties are mapped out to model how assets and data sources relate
across domains or lifecycle stages. Rules can then be created or deduced to extract particular information, provide context,
and geographically place information [8], [9], [37], [43], [52], [53], [54].
Through these capabilities, ontologies can deduce the consequences of how assets interact (intuitiveness), reason
optimal decisions to take (cognition), and allow users to easily add new rules or relationships (extensibility). Ontologies
also translate data to a common format for simplified analysis, easier information reuse, and data standardisation which
can in turn support interoperable or integrated DTws, leading to sectoral knowledge being shareable with generic DTw
software [4], [21], [31], [87], [88], [89]. Resulting semantic (based on words or meaning) descriptions are both human and
machine readable, allowing human stakeholders to access, interpret and interact with data [90]. These descriptions can
function across DTw lifecycle stages, meaning ontologies can formalise knowledge as assets are designed, then support
interoperability across systems once assets are operational [52]. Semantic definitions, constraints and rules used should be
as flexible, generalisable and standardised as possible to support interoperability [15] and might use the Web Ontology
Language (OWL), the widely used language for ontologies [37] commonly employed with the Protégé software [52].
7Beyond individual ontologies for particular systems, data from cross-sectoral DTws can be integrated through top-level
ontologies (an ontology of ontologies). Whilst specific ontologies can structure information from a specific sector,
challenges can arise in managing knowledge from across sectors [91], as concepts may have different meanings and
objectives depending on the context [92] and the most appropriate data structure may vary [4]. As a solution, ontologies
for specific sectors or lifecycle stages can be integrated through a cross-sectoral top-level ontology [6], [8], improving
interoperability and reusability [91], and formalising how the relevant assets, DTws and sectors are related [12], [31], [65].
Top-level ontologies can also enable the creation of DTw metamodels, which abstractly present only high-level
information. Such metamodels may offer more stability than linking many individual data models, and can show adaptable
levels of detail depending on user needs, or vary the level of functionality for particular lifecycle stages or dimensions [43].
If the underlying ontologies are flexible and configurable, this could foster interoperable, reusable and resilient DTws
eliminating the need to for users to have programming knowledge [19], [52].
2.2.2 Bridging Digital Twins and Ontologies – What are Cognitive Digital Twins?
Current DTw decision-making can be augmented with approaches that are 1) data-driven through AI including Machine
Learning (ML) (non-traceable algorithms that learn from data), or 2) knowledge-driven through ontologies. Cognitive
Digital Twin (CDTw) combine approaches so a integrates both principles of ontologies and ML into DTw systems, to
utilise benefits and minimise limitations of each [28]. CDTws have no singular definition but are DTw-based, capable of
combining pre-defined rules to reason insights through ontologies, and can autonomously integrate data across sectors and
over the full or partial asset lifecycles [12], [31], [91]. The absence of a concrete description is perhaps unsurprising as
CDTws are much less mature than DTws and are largely theoretical, with few successful examples [31], meaning the full
capabilities of interacting CDTw networks may still be uncertain [79]. Regardless, literature proposes that in addition to
the capabilities of DTws, a CDTw also needs to autonomously: 1) semantically reason (deduce rules and responses by
combining existing information) to learn or predict outcomes, for data-driven decisions that improve asset resilience or
sustainability; 2), transparently control and adjust the asset in real-time; 3) accurately interact with humans, assets and
other DTws in a responsive way that enables commonplace issues to self-resolve, saving human cognition for complex
issues; 4) continually link assets and models from other CDTws across network and sector boundaries; 5) understand the
context of historic data and detect anomalies; 6) model, calibrate and optimise assets throughout the full lifecycle. As such,
CDTws could become more effective the longer they are deployed in a system [2], [3], [13], [31], [41], [55], [79], [82],
[93].
Literature suggests that fully standardised, interactive CDTws may perform more efficiently and be more useable [16].
However, business models to be considered in industrial deployments, and literature notes that financial and resource
demands for implementing CDTws appear to be greater than for simpler DTws, due to more complex architecture which
comprises multiple lifecycle stages of multiple components [31]. As such, some literature suggests CDTws should only be
used as needed by the situation or stakeholders, due to the greater risk, cost and time involved [31]. CDTws could
particularly benefit data reuse in complex production systems with multiple production styles and various lifecycle stages
or stakeholder components that may require qualities such as flexibility, resilience, responsiveness, decision-making or
autonomy [31], [34]. Given the range of use cases and resource demands surrounding DTws, that ontologies or CDTws
face, it may therefore be prudent to identify what level of implementation is most advantageous.
82.3 How can Digital Twin and ontology adoption be evaluated?
Within the above sections, it is clear that design decisions can produce variants of DTws with divergent capabilities to
address differing needs, meaning a one-size-fits-all approach is not appropriate. A framework-based approach may be
beneficial to make sense of this complexity and to methodically inform users about considerations that could determine
the optimum scale and extent of implementation to be adopted, as depicted in Figure 4.
Figure 4 How the Gemini Principles could be used to evaluate DTws and ontologies
2.3.1 Taking a pragmatic approach – What is necessary for a useful Digital Twin and Ontology?
DTw research is split into conceptual research (considering what are ideal, theoretical DTws for the long-term), or
realisation research (crafting operational DTws using existing tools to solve a particular engineering problem for near-term
benefits) [23]. However, there are issues with solely pursuing either approach. Following a conceptual approach, a huge
DTw could eventually link all DTws of all use cases to enable interactions and synergies between these [14], twinning
assets and resource flows nationwide (termed a National Digital Twin) [55], [66], [94]. However, literature suggests that
with current capabilities, complete DTws realistically will be either left incomplete, isolated and inapt, or become too
unwieldly, and computationally and financially expensive [88], [92], [95]. Conversely, following a realisation path results
in DTws that are fragmented mappings of data for a particular purpose, which are useful today but may not be scalable or
applied beyond this scope [95]. At the extreme, partial representations with data, metadata and models to solve a specific
problem and context are termed Digital Shadows [10], [59]. There are clearly advantages and disadvantages to both
viewpoints.
Yet, pragmatic, intermediately-positioned DTw research focused on futureproofing realisation DTws whilst
implementing conceptual DTws [31] is proposed by some literature, but not broadly defined [10], and could combine cost
effective DTws and rich semantic information [95], by ontologically modelling only relevant relationships [88]. Shifting
9from perfect DTws towards incomplete yet practical DTws may be advantageous, given the complexity of integrating
DTws and the range of DTw definitions [10]. A similar logic could apply to how ontologies are adopted. A more
sophisticated, global ontology could integrate future DTws [72] but may not be immediately feasible or necessary; instead
flexible ontologies that continually evolve to align with new requirements may be preferable [92]. Delineating this
pragmatic approach to useable yet futureproofed DTws and ontologies is thus a research gap; this work proposes that using
a framework led approach could be beneficial for this middle ground, to guide inclusion or exclusion of tools and to
evaluate impacts and capabilities.
2.3.2 Evaluating ontologies in a DTw framework – What are the Gemini Principles?
One such framework for planning tools and impacts is the Gemini Principles, which seeks to coordinate stakeholders
around a common implementation of DTws. Advantages of this framework are a focus on implementation from the
individual DTw scale all the way to creating a National Digital Twin, a preference for connecting different assets as
appropriate, and an aspiration to build a consensus between policymakers, asset owners and operators, investors and
industry [96]. Figure 5 shows nine Gemini Principles centred around three lenses of Purpose, Trustworthiness and effective
Function [55]:
1 | Public good 2 | Value creation 3 | Insight

Figure 5 Gemini Principles, adapted from CDBB [55]
A. The Purpose of DTws should be for 1) Public Good, 2) Value Creation, and 3) Insight. Literature suggests it
should be clear why a DTw will be created, how it will be created and how it will be used [10] to determine what
data is collected and used [78]. Public Good can be considered to cover broader societal benefits beyond the
immediate remit of the DTw, Value Creation is provision of economic benefits or performance enhancement
exceeding the costs of implementation, Insight is new information learnt about the asset, sector or users.
10B. DTws must be Trustworthy with sufficient 4) Security, 5) Openness, and 6) Quality. DTw business models
may benefit from trusting and collaborative relationships rather than wholly transactional, competitive use [66],
[97].To facilitate this trust, DTws and related models may need to become more trustworthy, and overcome liability
gaps [93]. Security is protection of access and prevention of misuse. Openness is transparency in structure and
sharing of data and code. Quality is about detecting and enforcing data accuracy and precision.
C. DTws must have Functions of 7) Federation, 8) Curation, and 9) Evolution. Whilst the Principles describe
requirements, these are intentionally open-ended to support user innovation [55]. Federation is DTws working in a
standard data environment that facilitates interoperability and connectivity. Curation ensures ownership and clear
liability Evolution allows DTws to be extensible and adaptable to new innovations and approaches.
3 GENERAL METHODOLOGY
This study consists of a Systematic Literature Review (SLR). An SLR was deemed the most appropriate methodology to
collate existing work in a fair, wide-reaching way as an overview of current state of the art and to provide evidence of
Gemini Principles in action, even in cases where works may vary in approaches or do not consciously consider these
principles. Furthermore, the reproducibility of an SLR is also important, especially in light of the fast-changing pace of
this research area.
3.1 Systematic Literature Review description
This SLR followed the Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) method shown in
Figure 6. This method originates in healthcare, yet has been applied to SLRs across sectors [98] and consists of 3 stages:
1. Identification – systematic literature search, alongside some relevant reports. In this stage duplicates are
identified and removed. In this review, literature was systematically identified from 5 major databases (ACM,
IEEE, ProQuest, Scopus, Web of Science). Articles were filtered to peer-reviewed articles only. To ensure
articles were directly relevant (rather than simply making passing mention), keywords needed to be in the
article title, abstract or keywords. Before screening, duplicate reports were removed. In total, 416 articles
were identified, with 158 duplicates removed. Keyword terms searched were:
"digital twin" to ensure the literature explicitly references Digital Twins.
AND
semantic OR ontolog* OR cognitive to ensure an ontologically relevant aspect is mentioned,
with inclusion of cognitive, to account for CDTws.
AND
public good OR valu* OR insight* OR (secur OR resilien*) OR (open* OR transparen*)
OR quality OR (federa* OR interoper* OR interrelat* OR interconnect* OR interact* OR
interfac* OR integrat* OR communicat*) OR curat* OR evol* to ensure at least one term
relating to a Gemini Principle is mentioned. Common synonyms or related themes for these were
included as alternate search terms, given that global acceptance of the Gemini Principles has
11yet to be achieved. These were iteratively added into the search as they were encountered in
literature.
Other key reports relating to DTw definitions or the Gemini Principles and the systematic study method were
also included separately, so these concepts could be explored (yet were not included in the domain evaluation
later). These were attained through Google Searches for “CDBB”, “Grieves Definition”, “Digital Twin definition”,
“PRISMA method systematic literature review” and “interrater reliability method systematic literature review”.
2. Screening – literature shortlist with unsuitable work removed following inclusion or exclusion criteria (based
on the abstract and title, then later full text) or that could not be found. Within this work, articles were screened
for relevance by examining the title and abstract, to ensure they related to software ontologies and DTws. All
records were successfully retrieved. Next, report eligibility was assessed through inclusion criteria of the
paper content making notable mention of 1) DTws, 2) ontologies/CDTws or the semantic web and 3) a
concept similar to a Gemini Principle. Exclusion criteria are results not being a peer reviewed article. As a
result, 8 articles were screened from an irrelevant abstract and 118 removed for not meeting the inclusion
criteria.
3. Included – work is collated and content analysed. Ultimately, 130 articles were systematically obtained in this
review. Separately all 13 reports identified were used. This resulted in 143 pieces of literature to be reviewed.
However, PRISMA does not account for the subjectivity in how papers are judged to meet inclusion and exclusion
criteria; evaluators can have different views over how restrictive or all-encompassing to be, diminishing the replicability
of work. A fourth stage of ‘Inter rating’ was added to evaluate the validity of the exclusion and inclusion criteria. This
approach can improve reliability and lessen subjectivity in how judgements are made [99], [100].
4. Inter rating – a number of the total articles are randomly selected and evaluated by a second evaluator. This
number should be proportional to the number of articles and level of criteria to allow sufficient analysis without the
coder overthinking. High agreement over article inclusion and exclusion indicates robust criteria. In this work a
second evaluator reviewed 25% of articles (65/260) based on full paper content and determined which papers to
include or exclude, based on the above criteria. This achieved 83% agreement with the first evaluator.
Upon obtaining all of the literature, this study sought to classify articles by domain application.
5. Context classification: articles are then classified by domain and year to determine the spread of literature, with
the context of each work briefly described. The domain contexts of systematically reviewed literature are shown in
Figure 8 in the Appendix. Whilst articles tackled distinctive problems within varying applications, these have been
categorised under the umbrella sectors of manufacturing, built environment, other applications and theoretical.

Figure 6 PRISMA systematic literature filtering methodology [98]
3.2 Systematic Literature Review evaluation
Search terms used in this SLR appear to have successfully captured the key features of the topic; Digital Twin is of course
a crucial phrase for this search. Likewise covering semantic/ontological/cognitive components are essential to filtering
results to ontologically focused papers. In a prior review, D’Amico intentionally excluded CDTws, owing to the lesser
relevance to their review and the minimal number of papers at that time due to the term’s infancy [6], however, given the
prominence of ontologies in this review and the more developed relevance of CDTws, the phrase cognitive was considered
applicable. However, cognitive was the biggest source of manual screening, as several articles related to neuroscience and
brain cognition. Beyond the SLR, other notable reports and papers were used for defining DTws and the Gemini Principles
and were thus excluded from the literature classification.
Additionally, the search terms sought to include all instances of a Gemini Principle identified. However, given the
terminology of the Gemini Principles is not unanimously established in research, it was clear that other synonyms may
have been used to describe the principles in some work. For example, terminology for security is well-defined and
established, with resilience being the only identified synonym (albeit as a different but connected theme), meaning the
review appeared to capture a broad security frame with these two terms. In contrast, terminology relating to federation
(interoperability, interconnectivity etc.) is more loosely and diversely worded, resulting in a longer search chain relating
to this aspect; simply searching “inter*” as a blanket term would of course capture all articles mentioning the internet. As
such, terms were iteratively added to the search as discovered by the authors of this review, and there is recognition that
13some unique terms may have been missed by this net. This limitation does in itself highlight a possible future area to
improve standard nomenclature for how the concepts underlying these principles are discussed.
Interrater review achieved 83% agreement (54/65) between reviewers on which articles to include or exclude within
the review, which exceeds the 80% agreement threshold deemed acceptable by prior studies [100]. Sources of disagreement
predominantly centred over whether ontologies were sufficiently mentioned (mostly revolving around the use of the phrase
cognition), with a few disagreements over whether any of the Gemini Principles were addressed. In these cases, the authors
discussed the reasoning and appropriateness of these acceptance and rejections and agreed decisions.
3.3 Systematic Literature Review domain findings
Figure 7 illustrates the quantity of articles within each domain. 67 articles were reviewed in Manufacturing, 39 in Built
Environment, 18 in Other applications and 6 General articles. Figure 8 in the Appendix shows that ontologies have been
applied to myriad contexts and addresses unique challenges. As such, grouping research into these 4 domains clearly dilutes
the nuance from the unique applications considered by individual articles. However, this classification does capture the
broad idea that most papers focusing on ontologies to support a Gemini Principle for DTws are used within Manufacturing
or Built Environment spheres rather than domains such as healthcare or energy, which even clumped together into Other
Applications, pale in size as a category. This indicates that Manufacturing and Built Environment are leading the way in
recent advances, which should be unsurprising considering that DTw have their roots in these domains through the
precursor technologies of PLM and BIM. Additionally, both domains also depend on broad cross-sectoral supply chains,
potentially indicating more viable business cases. Moreover, only a few papers within this review were purely theoretical
or General in their application, reaffirming that industrial applications may lead recent focus on applying ontologies. Prior
literature suggests that the number of articles relating to DTws has greatly increased over recent years [16], and is certainly
in line with the findings of our work; 6 articles were published in 2019, 13 in 2020, 32 in 2021, and 49 in 2022. Whilst
only 17 were published in 2023, the year is ongoing at the time of this review. Interestingly 0 articles reviewed predate
2019, apparently confirming the relative infancy of the particular vein of research captured by these search terms.

Whilst the Gemini Principles are Built Environment focused, subsequent work notes that cross-domain analysis may be
warranted to futureproof DTws beyond individual domains; the Apollo Protocol is an ongoing set of guidelines for cross-
sectoral DTw collaboration between the built environment and manufacturing [101]. As such, research gaps for this study
seem to split into 2 fronts: 1) furthering ontological capabilities within more mature Manufacturing and Built Environment
sectors. 2) adapting existing ontologies and findings from Manufacturing and the Built Environment, into Other
14Applications; individual surveys do exist for some of these sectors (many of which included within this review) and could
be expanded with more practical ontologies to address the particular criteria and concerns of these less mature applications.
4 ONTOLOGIES FOR THE GEMINI PRINCIPLES
Whilst ontologies are not explicitly considered by the Gemini Principles, there do not seem to be any obstacles to
incorporating in this framework. Indeed, a review of the literature seems to establish that the strengths of ontologies can
support DTw observance of each of the Gemini Principles requirements. This section explores how current
implementations of ontologies within literature is supportive of each of the Gemini Principles in turn.
4.1 Lens A | Purpose
The first lens of the Gemini Principles focuses on ensuring the purpose behind the DTw is clear, to ensure that use is
beneficial to both users and broader society, contributing to the Public Good, producing Value and revealing Insight.
4.1.1 Principle 1 | Public Good
Ontologies can contribute to the Public Good by mapping out metrics for DTws that are important to a wider range of
stakeholders or support properties such as safety and sustainability. This is important for ensuring that the implications of
DTw models on the wider world can be transparently documented and assessed.
1. Catalogue stakeholder engagement: DTws currently seem to be viewed as primarily technical systems [51]. As
a result, social or ethical implications (i.e. who is affected and how) ensuing from DTw design or implementation
choices can be overlooked [66], [97]. Despite this, DTws could be capable of bring societal and economic benefits
to people globally (e.g. tackling citizens problems in a smart city) [4], [10]. DTw owners can mitigate these issues
by engaging a wider range of stakeholders directly or indirectly impacted by the asset. However, stakeholders
often have many diverse and conflicting perspectives. Interpreting the priorities raised by a wider consultation,
particularly for interconnected, shared assets (e.g. cities) has the potential to introduce more complexity into the
DTw. Ontologies can map and resolve conflicting demands and competing objectives [75], to more feasibly engage
with a broader spectrum of stakeholder perspectives.
2. Improve safety modelling: Whilst DTw deployment and simulation in isolation can support safe working and
early warning systems [3], identify hazards [102] and maximise user wellbeing [103], this may not fully consider
humans and machines interacting in the same space. In that regard, ontologies can improve DTw-based approaches
to safety management and embed considerations of safety across design and operation [14] as well as semantically
modelling hazards and defining safe use case parameters in human and machine readable terms [102], [104].
3. Map sustainability metrics: Current DTw applications to increase asset efficiency through reduced waste and
greater reuse can already advance sustainability and the circular economy (wherein waste products of one process
are inputs for another) [3], [55], [94], [105]. Furthermore, DTws can be applied to address goals set by local
communities and global UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) [94] through capabilities to: reduce energy
use and increase energy grid flexibility (Goal 7: Affordable and Clean Energy), link assets to produce innovative
insights and increase system resilience (Goal 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure), enable participatory
democracy by engaging citizens in planning and development (Goal 11: Sustainable cities and communities), and
improve asset system efficiency, reduce carbon footprint and quantify costs of climate inaction (Goal 13: Climate
action) [3], [81], [94]. Ontologies can further these efforts by processing the appropriate metrics for the DTw to
embed sustainability or SDG guidance across the whole asset lifecycle, once stakeholders map such goals [43].
154.1.2 Principle 2 | Value Creation
Ontologies support Value Creation in DTws, through establishing new data links and metrics in a human and machine
readable way, supporting optimisation and automation. This could allow DTws to further exploit existing data, guide data-
driven decisions and make more effective use of resources.
1. Deduce data links: DTws may maximise value generated through greater real-time connection and modelling of
assets across the whole supply chain and lifecycle to help stakeholders to share and use greater amounts of data
[2], [3], [55], [66], [76]. Ontologies could more efficiently link existing data and deduce new useful connections,
to maximise value obtained for businesses using DTws across design and operation stages [14], [94], [106].
Linking data for cross-asset purposes and applications could lead to more useful inferences from sensor data,
significant asset performance improvements (improved cost, time and efficiency) and novel business opportunities
[2], [9], [40], [44], [55], [64].
2. Define multiple value metrics: DTws are also an opportunity to better define sources of value, which may
currently be disregarded (i.e. unidentified changes that can be made to reduce costs or increase sales). Whilst DTw
adoption may in itself be a necessary edge for general competitiveness and productivity, the distinct sources of
value may need defining [3], [94], as financial and human barriers and incentives to implementing DTws can vary
by sector or use case [2], [3], [6], [19]. As such, there is no single business model for DTws [20], meaning different
user relationships can exist (such as owning or renting DTws during necessary stages) [2]. The most cost-effective
level of detail within DTw models also needs determining; vaster, more realistic and interactive DTws are feasible
as computing components become more advanced and cheaper [44] and economy of scale can be gained via
multiple DTws on the same server [64], however larger companies may be more prepared to maintain the necessary
IT infrastructure [107] (though it is true that cloud servers have a quasi-unlimited capacity for hosting multiple
DTs). As such, optimal solutions are circumstantial, requiring stakeholder coordination along supply chains [6] to
tailor what data should be captured, analysed and shared to maximise value [46]. Any attribute may be measurable
once connected to the DTw system [10]; breaking a top-level business problem into sub-questions down a
hierarchy of sub-DTws could support decision-making by helping users visualise various quantitative and
qualitative Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), trade-offs and constraints [88], and could evidence the
effectiveness of the DTw in different use cases [11], [13], [49]. Ontologies could unlock new sources of value for
DTws by defining and structuring value metrics and KPIs, then linking relevant data for complete performance
analysis across the whole DTw system, and flexibly responding to changing business requirements as indicators
are adjusted [43], [108].
3. Support automation and optimisation: DTws are already capable of optimising assets, by adjusting asset
components and parameters to interact more efficiently with other components and the environment, [38], [43],
[78] to reduce waste and increase productivity. However there are challenges in quantifying improvements,
working with multiple assets concurrently, modelling more complex environments and computing large data sets
[2], [3], [79]. This is particularly challenging for a DTw system of systems (i.e. an entire supply chain) as each
asset can have components with different functions, data scales and KPIs, whilst vast data collection is needed [9],
[44]. Meanwhile, DTws also support automation, control of all or part of an asset with human involvement reduced
or eliminated, of decision-making, to make operational choices that increase productivity and profits without
human involvement, including managing facilities, guiding or controlling vehicles and producing schedules [3],
[4], [78], [109]. Automation by its very nature needs fully machine readable data [110], meaning machine
readability of ontologies potentially aids automation of decision-making and asset operation [27], [72]. Ontologies
16can add value to DTws by enhancing capabilities for asset optimisation and automation, and ontologies within
CDTws could train ML to infer and predict from existing datasets for real-time automated control and decision-
making [13], [79].
4.1.3 Principle 3 | Insight
Ontologies can generate Insight in DTws by contextualising and linking DTw data. This allows for deeper understanding
of information to be given to DTws for new functionality and informed decision-making.
1. Contextualise data: DTws are becoming used for monitoring (observing assets through collected data) [58], [60],
[72], [78], [111] to inform users how assets behave across the lifecycle and in real-time [13], [14], [71], so that
more informed decisions and faster information flows can be achieved [48], [88]. However, raw data may only be
meaningful within the context it is collected, particularly where sensors capture real asset behaviour. Therefore
they may require processing and combining by the DTw to correctly reflect what is happening in real-time to bring
decision-making insights of business value [3], [37], [73], [88]. Ontologies can bring context and meaning to data
by mapping out relationships between stored information, which can then be graphically represented through
DTws [65], [67]. DTw literature observes that ontologies can be used for simulation as: 1) schema (theoretical,
example ontologies), 2) real-world applications (ontologies used with a physical asset, often as a database), 3)
aggregating external data sources (ontologies creating simulation models by integrating different datasets), and
4) scenarios (simulating a scenario wholly through ontologies) [112]. In particular, ontologies within CDTws can
deduce insights through a reasoning engine (a component for analysing metadata to deduce new insights and
patterns) [113].
2. Link data across asset lifecycle: DTws may be created over a long timeframe, playing various roles for different
data and changing information needs, challenges, priorities and intentions over several lifecycle stages [13], [31],
[51], [65], [106], [111] and are already capable of bringing out high-level information (which provides a broad
overview) about assets across planning and operation stages [20], [58], [72]. As such, DTws may become more
valuable as they are deployed over longer stretches of the asset lifecycle [6] and DTws for different lifecycle stages
could be integrated to be fully comparable, using different overviews and data linkages at different stages [2], [13],
[31]. This could lead to a more profound understanding of assets by enabling communication across supply chains
that interact at different lifecycle stages [33], and supporting predictive maintenance (using past data of failures to
predict when a functioning component or asset is close to failure) to reduce downtime and cut down operations
and maintenance costs [6]. Ontologies can create insight by temporally (relating to time) connecting data across
the asset lifecycle. In-depth ontologies can define component interactions for particular stages [33], [43], while a
general ontology can support a DTw for the full asset lifecycle [33] which could learn from past data to infer the
present context and improve estimations, decisions and predictions [2], [3], [79].
4.2 Lens B | Trust
The second lens of the Gemini Principles conveys the aspiration for users and society to trust DTws, both in terms of
outputs, and protecting data use, through improved Security, greater Openness, and higher Quality.
174.2.1 Principle 4 | Security
Ontologies can improve DTw Security by identifying and responding to threats, denoting access control and facilitating
Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs). Ontologies are important for ensuring consistent security management of DTws,
allowing secure best practice to be more universally embedded.
1. Threat identification: DTw platforms (software and hardware), assets and generalised data may need securing to
prevent unauthorised access, mitigating cyber threats that leave DTws vulnerable to industrial espionage, stolen
data, and sabotaged equipment. This risk is worsened by new potential threats and attack surfaces (weak points in
system security) arising as DTws become more established [3], [19], [44], [64]. To address vulnerabilities (security
weaknesses) if communications are intercepted (data seen or altered by the wrong person), devices connected to
assets may need identification, authentication (to verify identity and provenance), trustworthiness evaluation and,
if these precautionary measures are satisfied, authorisation and granting of controlled permissions. Ontologies can
support security policies (guidelines for protecting systems and information) that evaluate and prevent security
breaches in DTws, then can evaluate potential attack impacts [87].
2. Incident response: DTws can track device and system security, and monitor for unusual behaviour, verify when
users perform a particular action, model attack scenarios then enact appropriate countermeasures against likely
future attacker behaviours, and inform users of faulty or compromised devices [44], [73], [114], [115]. Ontologies
can then facilitate the assessment of users or devices against security attributes prior to allowing access to the DTw
[114]. They can subsequently also monitor device state, location and time after a device is used [114].
3. Denote access control: Assets segmented into subsections for security could be mirrored by a DTw with sub-
DTws [110] of different access criteria. However, partitioning assets could lead to data silos (internal to the DTw
or external between stakeholders). Ineffective data transfer between silos could present security risks and limit
knowledge gained by combining data [1], meaning there is a balance between ensuring that DTws and the data
stored are fully secure yet accessible in real-time [66], [74]. Additionally, stakeholders may generally refrain from
sharing data or access, due to the lack of capabilities to selectively share between organisations, alongside privacy,
intellectual property, ethical and regulatory implications of sharing data that is either confidential or can reflect
user behaviours [9], [51], [64], [76], [94]. Unauthorised access could lead to data deletion, use or change, so it
may be desirable to enact measures to ensure important data is appropriately immutable (unchanging with time)
and encrypted (obscured so only users with a passcode can see), however this is difficult when sharing across
stakeholders with different IT infrastructure [1]. Role or attribute-driven controls could grant selective access to
full data or specific attributes [64], but it may be unclear which data is openly accessible or confidential unless
this is actively considered when data is structured [51], creating an argument for security descriptors in DTw
ontologies. Ontologies can then enforce security policies to improve security, privacy and data integrity [73], and
are capable of evolving (adapting with time and innovations) in conjunction with changing security requirements
of an ever-shifting threat landscape [37].
4. Support Distributed Ledger Technologies: For DTws to be able to manage the security of assets and data, it is
important the DTw itself is secure [55]; web-accessible DTws must incorporate any usual security requirements
for online devices. Yet further security features may also be needed for critical DTws [64]. Sharing data from DTw
systems via Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) or blockchain (distributed protocols where data is spread
across many locations securely) that can handle vast amounts of data, can: 1) improve security, transparency and
data integrity by signing (checking a user genuinely requested information) and encrypting (so only the authorised
entity can decipher and read it) data; 2) increase privacy by reducing the amount of data transmitted, and supporting
18options for data sharing which is public (open to anonymous clients), or private (with permissions and predefined
entities); 3) expand scalability (ability to work with increasing demands as system grows) by providing immutable
(unalterable), structured, distributed and secure storage and capabilities to handle large amounts of data with access
and sharing rights (to control who can use and share data) [1], [31], [62], [77], [116]. However, DLTs may be
unable to identify or authenticate users due to the large quantity, complexity and heterogeneity of devices [117].
Ontologies may synergise with DLTs by structuring data to adhere to data governance policies to support data
reuse and protecting access to sensitive data by controlling how data on DLTs can be retrieved and by whom [1].
4.2.2 Principle 5 | Openness
Ontologies support the Openness of DTws by linking data across silos and mapping out FAIR Principles, in a human and
machine readable way that can synergise with internet infrastructure. This is important as ontologies are most useful when
shared and reused by an ecosystem of different parties, to maximise collaboration and data accessibility across sectors.
1. Enable Open DTws: ‘Open’ DTws 1) allow instant, free, modifiable implementation: being able to edit the DTw
source code, redistribute DTws across manufacturers or sectors and seek support from online communities, can
all speed up prototyping. 2) remove vendor lock-in: eliminating software license costs and extending DTw lifetime
by removing dependencies on a company software for updates, maintenance or third party extensions. 3) follow
open standards: facilitating interoperability, even amongst closed DTws. The result might be a quicker design
cycle, interoperability between lifecycle stages and a less fragmented supply chain [9], [44], [64], [67], [81], [118].
Whilst stakeholders may support reducing silos [81], many DTws are currently closed (unconnected to the
internet), proprietary (company-specific) systems, with architectures of differing definitions and relationships that
can lack the above benefits of open, shared systems. Data silos in DTws can also arise from software used, devices
adopted, and datasets from isolated domains, as well as a lack of programming knowledge or motivation to connect
DTws to the internet [1], [2], [6], [9], [44], [64], [65], [106]. Nevertheless, an open DTw can incorporate other
closed DTws [10]. Ontologies could overcome DTw silos by linking data from different systems. Ontologies are
inherently shareable (being modular and using a standard data format) [37] and can support data integration and
reuse in an open, visually clear way, for heterogenous devices across silos [43], [114].
2. Embody FAIR data principles: Data fragmentation can prevent stakeholders from benefiting from sector specific
knowledge, access to real-time information, or insights from connected data sources [27], [81]. Ontologies can
overcome data fragmentation and embed FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principles into
metadata. Adding publicly visible metadata descriptions to DTw data may make data more searchable and support
model reuse in similar contexts, reducing development time or the need to repeat tests to reobtain results; however
current metadata approaches may not be scalable or user friendly, which ontologies could address [64], [73], [107],
[119]. ‘FAIRness’ can be stored as metadata [32], allowing ontologies to use real or simulated metadata
descriptions of device capability and properties to link data, relationships and interactions [43], [110], [114].
3. Facilitate HMI: Structuring DTws to be readable and interoperable between both human users and devices, DTw
models, interfaces or information exchanges, would improve system efficiency [8], [10], [20], [29], [73].
Ontologies can provide this common structure understood by both humans and machines, which makes
information machine readable, and extractable by sharing and reusing knowledge from heterogenous data [27],
[108]. However, terms and descriptions used within the ontology may need sufficient richness (using more
descriptive and detailed language) to create semantic relationships that are capable of dealing with complexity
whilst supporting real-time decisions and remaining both human and machine interpretable [74], [89]. This could
19potentially use natural language definitions (words and sentences as spoken by humans, and used by e.g. chatbots)
to prevent misinterpretation or the use of ML training [46], [65].
4. Facilitate internet infrastructure: Ontologies can synergise with web services and Application Programming
Interfaces (APIs) (interfaces for software to interact) to support open DTws. APIs often act as middleware
communicating between applications, linking open source software [9], [47] and could oversee communications
between devices and mitigate incompatibilities between different communication protocols (rules defining data
exchange between devices) [109]. APIs can communicate with and alter ontologies, as well as using the ontology
to process data external to the asset [2], [112], with the potential to support quicker, more stable, adaptable and
more realistic DTw models by storing system configurations in a database [24], [120].
4.2.3 Principle 6 | Quality
DTw Quality can be improved by ontologies which can evaluate data quality, and adapt data fidelity to what is needed.
Using ontologies for high quality data matters to ensure a correct and accurate DTw.
1. Work with big data at high precision: DTw models can be high-accuracy, and can pair with precise sensor data
to quickly and reliably reflect and minutely adjust asset parameters and outputs (e.g. quality of a manufacturing
product, or modification of a component for maintenance) [3], [36], [41], [42], [72]. Yet the accuracy of DTws
rests on the quality of new data, visualisation quality and the appropriateness of assumptions made in the model
[3], [55]. This begs the question about quality metrics for DTws. As such, data quality needs measurement to
ensure users make decisions with DTws that are grounded in reality [74]. Furthermore, less precise or incorrect
data or results can be difficult to quickly identify in large data sets, and can result from discrepancies in: how
structured a dataset is, the scale of data collected, the quality of algorithms used for analysis and decision-making,
the extent of historic data collected across asset lifecycles, and whether data originates from third party sources
without clear provenance (record of data origins and history) [2], [9], [15], [41], [107]. As a result, most data may
not currently be reused [43], despite potential cost and time savings in reusing existing models (i.e. not having to
recreate models or re-collect data) [15], [73]. The sheer quantity of data collected and sources of value within
DTws may justify expending effort to fix this [27]; yet manually labelling mass quantities of images or videos is
clearly impractical, although it can mitigated with a semantic approach to categorise images and videos for humans
or machines [80].
2. Map quality metrics: The range of data, scenarios and devices [83] means no set singular judgement for quality,
usability or suitability of DTws exists [118] including: whether quality of user experience (response time,
rendering issues) or quality of service provided (delays, lags) are more important [77], or deviations between
individually measured As Designed components (which may not physically exist) against measurement of As Built
components (within a finished asset) [3], [39], [121]. Pairing ontologies with services could identify data quality
through rule-based analysis to: monitor and learn appropriate behaviours, detect anomalies for improved future
fault prediction, provide a communication interface with up-to-date information between DTws, optimise DTws,
and make decisions [69]. Ontologies can also work with incomplete, inconsistent or high uncertainty knowledge,
and iteratively refine relationships and patterns as new data is discovered [75], [118]. Increasing the data richness
by adding metadata and linking historic data [9] could further support evaluation of model completeness and
ontology consistency [119]. Additionally, ontologies can support measurement of data quality in terms of
correctness (how many values are erroneous?), completeness (how many values are missing?) and accuracy (how
close are values to what they should be?) [121].
203. Refine data fidelity: Ontologies can support fidelity management (accuracy and precision of information
appropriate to a context), allowing data simplification. DTws face challenges in integrating data of differing scales
(e.g. more detailed localised data with broader data categories with wide reaching data) for different processes,
including data and models used outside of their intended collection purpose [59]. As DTws are exposed to larger
datasets from real-time data streams, exacerbated by cheaper sensor networks, faster project lifecycles and greater
data variety [34], [110], [122], integrating data and systems becomes exponentially complex, growing increasingly
fast as size increases [65]. Yet, data criticality can vary (i.e. not all data is needed, or may not be needed to the
precision collected) [36]. As such, computational resources, asset efficiency and project value could all be
optimised [43], [72], [119] by modelling key data: 1) as simply as possible and proportional to scenario complexity
(i.e. a quick estimate, or a more in-depth analysis) [9], [73], 2) to meet a certain accuracy level or response time
required by a particular model, device or scenario (e.g. purpose may need real-time or just periodic updates for
Quality Control) [9], [82] 3) balancing accuracy against technical and financial costs of collecting and using data
[36], [39], [123], 4) adding additional parameters only as the environment is validated [119] (i.e. so that the number
of unverified sources of uncertainty is controlled). Complex DTws can be broken down into different granularity
scales [43], [93] with switchable fidelity in models that can be simplified and aggregated [123], then reused in
particular scenarios and structured using an ontology [36]. Synergising more permanent static data (that does not
change) with more reactive dynamic data (that changes in real-time) may be a particularly salient use case.
However, different datatypes have different information needs and change between lifecycle phases (i.e. static
data should be updated less frequently to reduce storage and computing requirements) [36], [45], [106]. Ontologies
can standardise processing for heterogenous data of multiple datatypes, scales, and granularities (levels of detail),
then support data cleaning (removing missing or incorrect data) and packaging (formatting and storing data) by
mapping correctness of syntax (grammatical structure) and provenance (traceability of prior data uses and origin)
[17], [37]. Ontologies can also define high and low fidelity models as well as the relationships between these, for
more flexible precision in the level of detail shared with stakeholders, supporting more advanced functions and
managing Big Data at workable levels of detail [32], [110], [123].
4.3 Lens C | Function
The third lens of the Gemini Principles has a focus on ensuring DTws can Function alongside other DTws and innovations,
now and in the future, via Federation of the DTw environment, suitable Curation practices, and capabilities for Evolution.
4.3.1 Principle 7 | Federation
Ontologies can support Federation of DTws by mapping relationships between heterogenous systems, particularly when
structured around standards or reference architectures. This is important for different DTws and ontologies to seamlessly
interoperate, understand each other, and be combined or compared.
1. Translate heterogenous systems: Managing DTws individually may be appropriate for isolated assets or
subsystems, but shifting to managing a DTw network using a systems approach, can support big picture decision-
making [88] by assimilating data of different formats [73]. However DTws that may interconnect within problem
domains could significantly differ in scope or scale to DTws from other sectors [2]. Yet, whilst many DTws may
not currently be fully interoperable [51], [55], integrating systems can support collaborative data-led asset
management and transparency across lifecycle stages and between sectors [22], [73], [80]. Linking DTws into
Federated networks of DTws, can result in inter-DTw learning, interoperability and integration [6], [35], [55]. A
21single DTw system could include multiple DTws for different components, asset subsystems and lifecycle stages,
each built by different sectors with different standards, architectures, and semantics [12], [124]. Interoperability
issues from heterogenous data [35] of multiple sources [34] may increase as devices become more complicated
and diverse [72] potentially resulting in inconsistently modelled DTws, hindering interoperability, reusability and
information sharing [33]. Ontologies can support interoperability for compatibility between systems from different
vendors [20]. Additionally, ontologies can unify information between heterogeneous DTws across sectors without
irreversibly transforming data, so new DTws can be easily added and integrated to a hierarchical DTw system at
the appropriate level (i.e. a component as part of an asset), whilst preserving asset autonomy and constraints [35],
[48], [80], [108].
2. Interpret reference architectures: Common ecosystems (connected data environments) and their associated data
governance policies (rules around data use and collection) may need to integrate knowledge across sectors or
fragmented, complex environments [57], [125]. Reference architectures are standardised frameworks for common
implementation [52] of the requirements, functionality, relationships, principles, structure and mechanisms needed
by a DTw [124]. Ontologies can link different reference architectures through common frameworks, data format
and structure to allow communication between components and systems [124], resulting in collaborative
ecosystems of DTws that follow asset processes rather than isolated tasks (e.g. a manufacturing line) [88].
However, a single ontology may not always be possible or desirable given that the context a DTw is implemented
in can contain other sub-contexts, meaning different DTws may have different needs and could thus require
contextual ontologies [35].
3. Enforce standards: Beyond reference architectures, ontologies can follow standards for various components and
processes. The lack of universally agreed standards across all DTw use cases or lifecycles means data may be
differently modelled or structured [52] limiting integration of these DTws [10]. However, components connected
to most commercial DTws may already follow existing industry standards, supporting interoperable data
exchanges between these [20]. Thus it is the relations between DTws that still needs to be standardised [64];
differing DTw standards may need blending to cover different sector specific challenges [90]. Furthermore, linking
and standardising DTws mean that existing DTws could be benchmarked (using performance of example use cases
as a comparison) [11], [14]. Ontologies can connect data, assets and models [8], [66] across applications with
different standards and requirements [7]. A universal standard could form the foundation for a common top-level
ontology, to ease integration of DTws from across sectors as the same overall dictionary is used [6]. Structuring
ontologies around open standards allows reusability between different software and stakeholders [67], [93].
Ontologically linked DTws can integrate diverging standards from multiple bodies to combine each standards’
expectations; some semantic interoperability may already exist between common industrial standards IEEE 1451
and IEC 61499 [7], [90].
4.3.2 Principle 8 | Curation
Ontologies support Curation of DTw data through being extensible, enforcing data governance policies, and linking
historic data:
1. Improve extensibility: Clearly defined and agreed assets and data reduce ambiguity in DTws’ documentation [3],
[88]. Ontologies can provide defined groundwork for DTws and can attribute a common correct version of
knowledge that is extensible (can work with new functionality) and scalable (can work with larger size systems),
to bring shared unambiguous meaning [35], [106] understandable to both humans and machines [32].
222. Administer data governance policies: Literature suggests that DTws may be needed to digitally formalise
processes (explicitly structure rules and requirements) [48] and adopt data and asset governance (management of
data policies and assets) [60], [61] to record and resolve different prioritisation of factors by different users at
different stages of the asset lifecycle [93]. By mapping out a transparent, open set of governance rules, ontologies
can integrate resources to create shared, interoperable knowledge with improved traceability and decision
consistency [88]. In particular, CDTws could be deployed and operated across the supply chain, with stakeholders
jointly configuring the CDTw at the design phase: the information to include; the level of decision-making
autonomy to be granted (including identification of business, operational and ethical decision-making
considerations), and the allocation of liability and accountability for data processed from different owners along
the asset supply chain [13].
3. Standardise terminology: Historic data about assets and DTws may need efficient and traceable storage to be
useful for real-time analysis that is fully comparable across the entire lifecycle for the different overviews and
linkages needed at different stages of the lifecycle [11], [37], [41]. However, definitions used for assets or
components can vary within an organisation [11]. As such, using ontologies to define a common framework and
terminology could make data more reusable, and facilitate data sharing [8], [94]. Furthermore by exploring
relationships between data and providing context, ontologies improve the interoperability and reusability of data
[65], [67].
4.3.3 Principle 9 | Evolution
Evolution (capability to change with time and new technologies) of DTws is supported by ontologies which are able to
manage version control and are suitably structured to be amendable for future innovations and to incorporate AI. This
ensures ontologies remain a relevant tool and are adaptable to future changes.
1. Versioning: DTws may need to be able to evolve and respond to potentially time-sensitive real-time updates in
ever changing assets, however, overwriting existing data can cause regression and prevent its reuse, unless
different versions are saved [37], [41]. Keeping different versions for data provenance (record of data origins and
history) could be particularly problematic in a scenario where various stakeholders in a project may create new
versions that may conflict with prior versions [126]. Ontologies can manage the collation and merging of
information changes and model versions, storing parameter states (current values and conditions of different asset
properties), with new versions created as these change, and can provide metadata contextualisation for autonomous
interoperability and version information [37], [43], [73].
2. Adapt with improvements: Design, configuration, control and operation of DTws or assets will continually
evolve with new technologies, methods, tools, processes, materials, use cases, operational and business strategies
and become increasingly complex with more connected components and subsystems [12], [42], [82]. Ontologies
could support adoption of different data sources [57]: 1) rich semantic information for a particular project (e.g.
from BIM) or, low detail, wider contextual information (e.g. from Geographic Information System (GIS)) [108],
2) semantically represent knowledge to support Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) [2]
visualisation of DTw models [16], or 3) communicate directly with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) [87] or
IoT sensors [90].
3. Incorporate Advanced AI: Ontologies in CDTws could support self-learning systems (trained with historic data
to improve performance over time) [48], using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to coordinate and adapt to changes and
model potential future scenarios [22], [82]. However literature suggests the term is used imprecisely [4] and
23comprises algorithms with purposes of data mining (extracts patterns or insights from datasets), ML or Deep
Learning (DL) (a form of ML using layered neural networks to simulate human brain function for more advanced
tasks [127]) , that can each be used with DTws [107] to further link data and maximise business advantages [11],
[95]. Literature suggests ontologies can pair well with AI, and can bring clarity to decisions made by ML-trained
systems [14], [75], [128], [129].
4. Embed modularity: As many devices are used across various lifecycle stages, a single simulation is unlikely to
be able to process and convey all information in a timely way. This suggests that modular (separated into individual
sections that can be individually added or changed) DTws may be beneficial [23]. Indeed, rather than a single
system, DTws consist of sets of infrastructures [10], meaning, modular architecture made of microservices
(services with granular functionality but not necessarily minute code) can simplify DTw code, make it easier to
maintain, support decentralised architecture and can be created by different teams using various coding languages,
improving flexibility and scalability [9], [25], [73]. The modularity of contextualised ontologies mean these are
easily maintainable and reusable in existing or future contexts [35], [73].
4.4 Summarising use cases – how useful are ontologies in meeting the Gemini Principles?
Ontologies have been shown to be relevant for each Gemini Principle.
A) Purpose: 1) Literature found ontologies can contribute to the Public Good through engaging a broader range of
stakeholders, improving safety monitoring, increasing stakeholder engagement, and governing sustainability
metrics. Possible further areas not mentioned by literature could include ontologies for identifying and overcoming
data biases. 2) Literature indicates that ontologies could create Value by creating profitable connections, providing
metrics of value, as well as supporting automation and optimisation of assets. 3) According to literature, ontologies
could generate Insight through contextualising data, and linking data across the asset lifecycle.
B) Trust: 4) Literature highlights that ontologies can improve Security by identifying threats, responding to incidents,
supporting dynamic access controls, and synergising with DLTs for secure data storage and sharing. However,
literature did not discuss how well ontologies mix with existing security measures, nor how to ensure that the
ontology itself is secure. It is important that ontologies should not introduce a vulnerability, as any DTw system
needs to be secure throughout. 5) Literature studies found that ontologies can support Openness by supporting
Open DTws, facilitating FAIR data management, facilitating Human Machine Interaction and integrating services,
APIs and web technologies into DTws. 6) Findings from literature note that ontologies can improve Quality by
mapping quality metrics, and dynamically managing data fidelity. Yet, there was no mention of evaluating the
quality of the semantics of an ontology itself, nor how ontologies could impact the quality of service provided by
DTw.
C) Function: 7) Literature highlights that ontologies can support Federation by managing interoperability between
heterogenous systems and enforcing common reference architectures and standards. 8) Literature found Curation
ontologies could support extensibility, manage data governance policies, and reuse historic data. 9) Literature
reports ontologies can sustain Evolution by tracking version changes, supporting modularity, and integrating new
innovations and AI. Yet, interactions within ontologies between new and legacy innovations were not discussed.
Regardless of the intended outcome or lens, many of these opportunities appear to amount to using ontologies to link
devices and data to enable interoperability, or for governance policies to decide how data or devices are handled. Whilst it
could be argued that applying a Gemini Principles overview is therefore superfluous, instead, the use of the Gemini
24Principles demonstrates the wide range of applications that embedding ontologies into DTws can bring, whilst allowing
evaluation of ontology implementation to be enmeshed into evaluation against wider DTw goals.
5 CONCLUSION
Literature reviewed in this SLR encompassed research which used ontologies to non-explicitly address each Gemini
Principle in turn, primarily to federate networks of connected DTws and to map important relationships and properties as
metadata, pointing towards research directions in furthering these topics. Most literature originated in Manufacturing and
the Built Environment; these are more developed sectors with more mature DTw ontologies that can continue practical
work to build deeper ontological interoperability. Meanwhile, other less developed sectors such as healthcare or energy
could benefit from adapting successful work from these more mature sectors, to align with sectoral requirements and
context.
5.1 What are key areas for future work?
Existing literature indicates that specific future directions of DTws are hard to predict, but could be highly impactful [2].
As DTws are interdisciplinary, there are areas for advancement through research, alongside challenges for industry and
government to resolve, gathered in the subsections below (though many points raised could require input from all 3 groups).
5.1.1 Digital Twin gaps in research
Literature has identified several research gapsin representing unconventional properties and considering the future of DTws
that require further research:
1. Representing unconventional properties: Gaps may exist in ontologically representing real world ambiguity
[15], and more abstract concepts (including actions such as pushing or pouring) [72]. Once ontologies are more
sophisticated, applications of DTws for economic modelling could also be investigated [47]. One possible solution
is to use Natural Language Processing to guess links between assets and data for an ontology [9], [31].
2. Futures of DTws: Research on how ontologies will evolve is in early stages [37]. Yet, challenges in generalising
existing enabling technologies [34] mean integrating DTws is difficult due to: system complexity, unfeasibility of
aggregating large datasets, lack of historic data, continual changes in some operating parameters and conditions,
and complexity in handling data ownership [1], [2], [23], [31]. Furthermore, capabilities to easily create a top-
level DTw for an individual asset may be needed before attempting to make networks of DTws [64]. Whilst
ontologies are extensible, there is a research gap in ensuring ontologies are structured in as reusable a way as
possible.
5.1.2 Digital Twin gaps in industry
There are technical challenges industry may need to consider including consideration of the full DTw lifecycle, wider
security and privacy of the DTw system, interoperability across sectors, and overcoming barriers to adoption:
1. Full lifecycle consideration: A technical challenge could be managing an ontology for the entire lifecycle of a
digital twin system, (from design to maintenance). Standardised ontological languages from earlier stages of DTw
lifecycles are often not used further or connected to other models [14], as the way ontologies are integrated depends
on the particular task [80]. Furthermore, there may be a gap for expanding semantic attributes to work beyond the
DTw lifecycle for other complementary tools such as BIM or GIS, with a possible need for formalised syntax [52].
252. Wider security and privacy: Security, privacy and safety are areas for future work [73] that may need to consider
scalability, data loss, and human interaction [79]. As DTws integrate new approaches and technologies, new
security risks or vulnerabilities may be created [9], [10] which may need defining and mapping by ontologies.
Additionally, ontologically-linked KPIs may need to include metrics that consider security and privacy [9].
3. Cross-sector interoperability: Sectoral challenges in interoperability, flexibility and modularity [9] may remain,
despite advances in ontologies. Further challenges for DTws lie in making DTw architecture scalable, adaptable,
reusable and flexible [15] and to account for manufacturers using different devices and APIs [76], which could be
resolvable through ontologies. Additionally, standardised manuals with sector expert feedback could be combined
to guide ontology construction [109], with specific use cases to benchmark (test performance) an ontology
alongside generic modelling documentation [52]. There is thus a gap in developing standardised ontologies that
can be applied across various sectors, whilst accounting for different functionality.
4. Overcome barriers to adoption: Gaps exist in overcoming technical, financial and perception barriers for data
sharing [55]. Thus DTws may require culture changes from industry and stakeholders [78]. The complexity of
DTws increases as data elements are added and more technologies are adopted [2], [4], [31], creating challenges
for DTw asset owners in: storing vast amounts of data created, guaranteeing real-time connection to moving or
remote assets, supplying the high computation power needed to maintain sensors, and training personnel to operate
DTws [37], [78]. Financial challenges arise from costs of collecting the vast dataset needed [46], maintaining
servers and big data management [6], [46], [64]. Furthermore, there is technical complexity to overcome in:
processing heterogenous data, linking time-based data with context, controlling access to information, and creating
services that can semantically exchange information and access multiple real-time data streams simultaneously
[25].
5.1.3 Digital Twin gaps in policy
There are policy gaps relating to improving standards around DTws, regulation and consideration of IP and
liability.
1. Standards: There are challenges integrating services [31] and in linking different DTw models by CDTw
architecture [31], as alluded to in Section 4. The particulars of services and open standards may need deciding
upon, in terms of how centralised or decentralised, and how government-run or market-run [10]. This is
particularly challenging for Standards Developing Organisations to standardise across sectors [31]. There is a
standards gaps for semantics between DTws and related innovations, such as BIM [51].
2. Regulation: Stronger action than simply recommendations through standards, may be needed. Regulation could
be required to both define liabilities and steer towards positive outcomes to ensure DTw remains a public good
[97]. This could potentially necessitate future work in applying standards to ontologies themselves [25]; multiple
popular top-level ontologies exist, possibly necessitating standards between them [31]. As such it may be
important to ensure that ontologies support (and do not breach) such regulations.
3. IP and liability: Ownership of digital assets has been explored by prior literature [47], yet this has not been
mentioned elsewhere in the literature. No works reviewed refer to using to ontologies define intellectual property,
ownership or use rights related to data, models, or the insights derived from them these as metadata properties.
Likewise, none of the literature mentions data liability nor using ontologies to assign this. These are both
important considerations, which may be addressable through ontologies.
265.2 Closing remarks
This literature review has captured the capability of ontologies to support each of the 9 Gemini Principles, predominantly
through federating DTws and data, alongside data governance policies. Most research relating to ontologies for meeting
each of these principles is in the fields of Manufacturing and the Built Environment.
Future work exists in further applying ontologies to the Gemini Principles, as well as transferring lessons learnt from
more mature sectors to less developed sectors. Additionally, research gaps exist in using ontologies to represent more
complex or abstract properties and to ensure DTws are futureproofed. Meanwhile, areas for industry to progress are
creating interoperable ontologies across sectors and lifecycle stages, ensuring ontologies and related innovations are secure,
and overcoming technical, financial, or cultural barriers. In addition, policy gaps need to be filled in developing standards
or regulation as appropriate and considering IP and liability. By bridging gaps between research, industry, and academia,
this article intended to set the stage for continued progress in leveraging ontologies for resilient, federated DTws.
