Nearly Optimal Algorithms for Contextual Dueling
Bandits from Adversarial Feedback
Qiwei Di∗ and Jiafan He† and Quanquan Gu‡
Abstract
Learning from human feedback plays an important role in aligning generative models, such
as large language models (LLM). However, the effectiveness of this approach can be influenced
by adversaries, who may intentionally provide misleading preferences to manipulate the output
in an undesirable or harmful direction. To tackle this challenge, we study a specific model
within this problem domain–contextual dueling bandits with adversarial feedback, where the
true preference label can be flipped by an adversary. We propose an algorithm namely robust
contextual dueling bandit (RCDB), which is based on uncertainty-weighted maximum likelihood
√
estimation. Our algorithm achieves an O(cid:101)(d T +dC) regret bound, where T is the number of
rounds, d is the dimension of the context, and 0 ≤ C ≤ T is the total number of adversarial
feedback. We also prove a lower bound to show that our regret bound is nearly optimal, both in
scenarios with and without (C =0) adversarial feedback. Additionally, we conduct experiments
to evaluate our proposed algorithm against various types of adversarial feedback. Experimental
results demonstrate its superiority over the state-of-the-art dueling bandit algorithms in the
presence of adversarial feedback.
1 Introduction
Acquiring an appropriate reward proves challenging in numerous real-world applications, often
necessitating intricate instrumentation (Zhu et al., 2020) and time-consuming calibration (Yu et al.,
2020) to achieve satisfactory levels of sample efficiency. For instance, in training large language
models (LLM) using reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), the diverse values and
perspectivesofhumanscanleadtouncalibratedandnoisyrewards(Ouyangetal.,2022). Incontrast,
preference-baseddata,whichinvolvescomparingorrankingvariousactions,isamorestraightforward
method for capturing human judgments and decisions. In this context, the dueling bandit model
(Yue et al., 2012) provides a problem framework that focuses on optimal decision-making through
pairwise comparisons, rather than relying on the absolute reward for each action.
However, humanfeedbackmaynotalwaysbereliable. Inreal-worldapplications, humanfeedback
is particularly vulnerable to manipulation through preference label flip. Adversarial feedback can

influence of adversarial feedback, there is limited existing research on the impact of adversarial
feedback specifically within the context of dueling bandits. A notable exception is Agarwal et al.
(2021), which studies dueling bandits when an adversary can flip some of the preference labels
received by the learner. They proposed an algorithm that is agnostic to the amount of adversarial
feedback introduced by the adversary. However, their setting has the following two limitations.
First, their study was confined to a finite-armed setting, which renders their results less applicable
to modern applications such as RLHF. Second, their adversarial feedback focuses on the comparison
matrix. At each round, the adversary observes the outcomes of all pairwise comparisons and then
decides to corrupt some of the pairs before the agent selects the actions. This assumption does not
align well with the real-world scenario, where the adversary often flips the preference label based on
the information of the selected actions.
In this paper, to address the above challenge, we aim to develop contextual dueling bandit
algorithms that are robust to adversarial feedback. This enables us to effectively tackle problems
involving a large number of actions while also taking advantage of contextual information. We
specifically consider a scenario where the adversary knows the selected action pair and the true
preference of their comparison. In this setting, the adversary’s only decision is whether to flip the
preference label or not. We highlight our contributions as follows:
• We propose a new algorithm RCDB, which integrates uncertainty-dependent weights into the
Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE). Intuitively, our choice of weight is designed to induce a
higher degree of skepticism about potentially “untrustworthy” feedback. The agent is encouraged
to focus more on feedback that is more likely to be genuine, effectively diminishing the impact of
any adversarial feedback.
• WeanalyzetheregretofouralgorithmunderatmostC numberofadversarialfeedback. Ourresult

consists of two terms: a C-independent term O(cid:101)(d T), which matches the lower bound established
in Bengs et al. (2022) for uncorrupted linear contextual dueling bandits, and a C-dependent term
O(cid:101)(dC). Furthermore, we establish a lower bound for dueling bandits with adversarial feedback,
demonstrating the optimality of our adversarial term. Consequently, our algorithm for dueling
bandits attains the optimal regret in both scenarios, with and without adversarial feedback.
• We conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of our algorithm RCDB. To compre-
hensively assess RCDB’s robustness against adversarial feedback, we evaluate its performance under
various types of adversarial feedback and compare the results with state-of-the-art dueling bandit
algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm in the presence of
adversarial feedback, which corroborate our theoretical analysis.

2 Related Work
Bandits with Adversarial Reward. The multi-armed bandit problem, involving an agent
making sequential decisions among multiple arms, has been studied with both stochastic rewards
(Lai et al., 1985; Lai, 1987; Auer, 2002; Auer et al., 2002a; Kalyanakrishnan et al., 2012; Lattimore
andSzepesva´ri,2020;AgrawalandGoyal,2012), andadversarialrewards(Aueretal.,2002b;Bubeck
et al., 2012). Moreover, a line of works focuses on designing algorithms that can achieve near-optimal
regret bounds for both stochastic bandits and adversarial bandits simultaneously (Bubeck and
Slivkins, 2012; Seldin and Slivkins, 2014; Auer and Chiang, 2016; Seldin and Lugosi, 2017; Zimmert
and Seldin, 2019; Lee et al., 2021), which is known as “the best of both worlds” guarantee. Distinct
from fully stochastic and fully adversarial models, Lykouris et al. (2018) studied a setting, where
only a portion of the rewards is subject to corruption. They proposed an algorithm with a regret
dependent on the corruption level C, defined as the cumulative sum of the corruption magnitudes at
each round. Their result is C times worse than the regret without corruption. Gupta et al. (2019)
improved the result by providing a regret guarantee comprising two terms, a corruption-independent
term that matches the regret lower bound without corruption, and a corruption-dependent term that
is linear in C. In addition, Gupta et al. (2019) proved a lower bound demonstrating the optimality
of the linear dependency on C.
Contextual Bandits with Corruption. Li et al. (2019) studied stochastic linear bandits with
corruption and presented an instance-dependent regret bound linearly dependent on the corruption
level C. Bogunovic et al. (2021) studied the same problem and proposed an algorithm with near-
optimal regret in the non-corrupted case. Lee et al. (2021) studied this problem in a different setting,
where the adversarial corruptions are generated through the inner product of a corrupted vector
and the context vector. For linear contextual bandits, Bogunovic et al. (2021) proved that under an
additional context diversity assumption, the regret of a simple greedy algorithm is nearly optimal
with an additive corruption term. Zhao et al. (2021) and Ding et al. (2022) extended the OFUL
algorithm (Abbasi-Yadkori et al., 2011) and proved a regret with a corruption term polynomially
3dependent on the total number of rounds T. He et al. (2022) proposed an algorithm for known
corruption level C to remove the polynomial dependency on T in the corruption term, which only
has a linear dependency on C. They also proved a lower bound showing the optimality of linear
dependency on C for linear contextual bandits with a known corruption level. Additionally, He et al.
(2022) extended the proposed algorithm to an unknown corruption level and provided a near-optimal
performance guarantee that matches the lower bound. For more extensions, Kuroki et al. (2023)
studied best-of-both-worlds algorithms for linear contextual bandits. Ye et al. (2023) proposed a
corruption robust algorithm for nonlinear contextual bandits.
Dueling Bandits. The dueling bandit model was first proposed in Yue et al. (2012). Compared
withbandits, theagentwillselecttwoarmsandreceivethepreferencefeedbackbetweenthetwoarms
fromtheenvironment. Forgeneralpreference, theremaynotexistthe“best”armthatalwayswinsin
the pairwise comparison. Therefore, various alternative winners are considered, including Condorcet
winner (Zoghi et al., 2014; Komiyama et al., 2015), Copeland winner (Zoghi et al., 2015; Wu and
Liu, 2016; Komiyama et al., 2016), Borda winner (Jamieson et al., 2015; Falahatgar et al., 2017;
Heckel et al., 2018; Saha et al., 2021; Wu et al., 2023) and von Neumann winner (Ramamohan et al.,
2016; Dud´ık et al., 2015; Balsubramani et al., 2016), along with their corresponding performance
metrics. To handle potentially large action space or context information, Saha (2021) studied
a structured contextual dueling bandit setting. In this setting, each arm possesses an unknown
intrinsic reward. The comparison is determined based on a logistic function of the relative rewards.
In a similar setting, Bengs et al. (2022) studied contextual linear stochastic transitivity model
with contextualized utilities. Di et al. (2023) proposed a layered algorithm with variance aware
regret bound. Another line of works does not make the reward assumption. Instead, they assume
the preference feedback can be represented by a function class. Saha and Krishnamurthy (2022)
designed an algorithm that achieves the optimal regret for K-armed contextual dueling bandit
problem. Sekhari et al. (2023) studied contextual dueling bandits in a more general setting and
proposed an algorithm the provides guarantees for both regret and the number of queries.
Dueling Bandits with Adversarial Feedback. A line of work has focused on dueling bandits
with adversarial feedback or corruption. Gajane et al. (2015) studied a fully adversarial utility-based
version of dueling bandits, which was proposed in Ailon et al. (2014). Saha et al. (2021) considered
the Borda regret for adversarial dueling bandits without the assumption of utility. In a setting
parallel to that in Lykouris et al. (2018); Gupta et al. (2019), Agarwal et al. (2021) studied K-armed
dueling bandits in a scenario where an adversary has the capability to corrupt part of the feedback
received by the learner. They designed an algorithm whose regret comprises two terms: one that
is optimal in uncorrupted scenarios, and another that is linearly dependent on the total times of
adversarial feedback C. Later on, Saha and Gaillard (2022) achieved “best-of-both world” result for
noncontextual dueling bandits and improved the adversarial term of Agarwal et al. (2021) in the
same setting. For contextual dueling bandits, Wu et al. (2023) proposed an EXP3-type algorithm for
the adversarial linear setting using Borda regret. In this paper, we study the influence of adversarial
feedback within contextual dueling bandits, particularly in a setting where only a minority of the
feedback is adversarial. Compared to previous studies, most studies have focused on the multi-armed
dueling bandit framework without integrating context information. The notable exception is Wu
et al. (2023); however, this study does not provide guarantees regarding the dependency on the
number of adversarial feedback instances.
43 Preliminaries
In this work, we study linear contextual dueling bandits with adversarial feedback. At each round
t ∈ [T], the agent observes the context information x from a context set X and the corresponding
t
actionsetA. Utilizingthiscontextinformation,theagentselectstwoactions,a andb . Subsequently,
t t
the environment will generate a binary feedback (i.e., preference label) l = 1(a ≻ b ) ∈ {0,1}
t t t
indicating the preferable action. Following Bengs et al. (2022); Di et al. (2023), we assume the
existence of a reward function r∗(x,a) dependent on the context information x and action a.
Furthermore, there exists a monotonically increasing link function σ satisfying σ(x)+σ(−x) = 1.
The preference probability will be determined by the link function and the difference between the
rewards of the selected arms, i.e.,
P(a ≻ b|x) = σ(cid:0) r∗(x,a)−r∗(x,b)(cid:1) . (3.1)
As a common practice in the study of dueling bandits (Saha, 2021; Di et al., 2023), we make a linear
assumption on the reward function:
Assumption 3.1. Let ϕ : X ×A → Rd be a known feature map, with ∥ϕ(x,a)∥ ≤ 1 for any
2
(x,a) ∈ X × A. We define the reward function r parameterized by θ ∈ Rd, with r (x,a) =
θ θ
⟨θ,ϕ(x,a)⟩. Moreover, there exists θ∗ satisfying r = r∗, with ∥θ∗∥ ≤ B.
θ∗ 2
Assumption 3.1 aligns with the setting studied in Xiong et al. (2023) and acts as a special case
of Sekhari et al. (2023).
During each round t, the optimal action is denoted by a∗ = argmax r∗(x ,a). The regret over
t a∈A t
the first T rounds is defined as the cumulative sub-optimality between the rewards of the optimal
actions and the rewards of the selected actions:
T
(cid:88)
Regret(T) = 2r∗(x ,a∗)−r∗(x ,a )−r∗(x ,b ). (3.2)

Remark 3.2. The linear contextual dueling bandit model shares a similar parametric structure
with both the generalized linear bandit model (Filippi et al., 2010; Li et al., 2017) and the logistic
bandit model (Faury et al., 2020; Abeille et al., 2021; Faury et al., 2022). Specifically, in each
round t, the act of selecting two arms, a and b , in the dueling bandit framework can be reduced to
t t
pulling an auxiliary ”arm” ϕ(x,a )−ϕ(x,b ) with the linear parameter θ∗, as in the logistic bandit
t t
or generalized bandit models. However, a key distinction arises in the computation of regret between
these tasks. In the dueling bandit problem, the reward for the selected action is represented as
r(x ,a )+r(x ,b ), in contrast to r(x ,a )−r(x ,b ) in the single-arm analogy. This discrepancy
t t t t t t t t
implies that the linear contextual dueling bandit problem diverges significantly from both linear
bandits and logistic bandits.
We also make an assumption on the derivative of the link function, which is common in the
study of generalized linear models for bandits and dueling bandits (Filippi et al., 2010; Di et al.,
2023).
Assumption 3.3. The link function σ is differentiable. Furthermore, its first-order derivative
satisfies:
σ˙(·) ≥ κ
for some constant κ > 0.
5In our setting, however, the agent does not directly observe the true binary feedback. Instead, an
adversary will see both the choice of the agent and the true feedback. Based on the information, the
adversary can decide whether to corrupt the binary feedback or not. We represent the adversary’s
decision at round t by a corruption indicator c , which takes values from the set {0,1}. If the
t
adversary chooses not to corrupt the result, we have c = 0. Otherwise, we have c = 1, which means
t t
adversarial feedback at this round, and the agent will observe a flipped preference label, i.e., the
observation o = 1−l . We define C as the total number of adversarial feedback 1

Remark 3.4. In our work, the adversary can corrupt the feedback after observing the action
chosen by the agent, which is referred to as the strong adversary in Bogunovic et al. (2021); He
et al. (2022). In comparison, a weak adversary is limited to corrupting feedback without knowledge
of the agent’s selection. Since the weak adversary lacks knowledge of the selected action, it usually
predetermines a set of action pairs to corrupt. Under this situation, the number of adversarial
feedback c at round t is defined either as the maximum corruption magnitude for all pairs (For our
t
binary feedback, this would be 1 if adversarial feedback exists for one action, and 0 otherwise) or
as the total number of corrupted pairs at round t (Agarwal et al., 2021). Therefore, for a strong
adversary with knowledge of the agent’s selected action, the problem of adversarial feedback becomes
more challenging compared to scenarios involving a weak adversary.

This type of weighting is initially introduced by He et al. (2022) for the linear bandit problem.
Intuitively speaking, the exploration bonus captures the uncertainty associated with the duel (a ,b )

Remark 5.2. If we set α = ( d+ λB)/C, then the bonus radius β has no direct dependency on
the number of adversarial feedback C. This observation plays a key role in proving the adversarial
term in the regret without polynomial dependence on the total number of rounds T.
With Lemma 5.1, we can present the following regret guarantee of our algorithm RCDB in the
dueling bandit framework.
Theorem 5.3. Under Assumption 3.1 and 3.3, let 0 < δ < 1, the total number of adversarial
feedback be C. If we set the bonus radius to be

Moreover, if we set α = ( d+ λB)/C, λ = 1/B2, the regret upper bound can be simplified to

where O(cid:101) hides logarithmic factors on T,B and 1/δ.
Remark 5.4. Our regret bound consists of two terms. The first one is a C-independent term
√ √
O(cid:101)(d T), which matches the lower bound Ω(cid:101)(d T) proved in Bengs et al. (2022). This indicates
that our result is optimal in scenarios without adversarial feedback (C = 0). Additionally, our
result includes an additive term that is linearly dependent on the number of adversarial feedback C.
√
When C = O( T), the order of regret will be the same as the stochastic setting. It indicates the
robustness of our algorithm to adversarial feedback. Additionally, the following theorem we present
establishes a lower bound for this adversarial term, indicating that our dependency on the number
of adversarial feedback C and the context dimension d is also optimal.
Theorem 5.5. For any dimension d, there exists an instance of dueling bandits with |A| = d, such
that any algorithm with the knowledge of the number of adversarial feedback C must incur Ω(dC)
regret with probability at least 1/2.
8Remark 5.6. The proof of Theorem 5.5 follows Bogunovic et al. (2021). In the constructed
instances, only one action has reward 1, while others have 0. Compared with linear bandits, where
the feedback is an exact reward, dueling bandits deal with the comparison between a pair of actions.
A critical observation from our preference model, as formulated in (3.1), is that two actions with
identical rewards result in a pair that is challenging to differentiate. The lower bound can be proved
by corrupting every comparison into a random guess until the total times of adversarial feedback
have been used up. For detailed proof, please refer to Section A.2. Our proved lower bound Ω(dC)

5.2 Unknown Number of Adversarial Feedback
In our previous analysis, the selection of parameters depended on having prior knowledge of the
total number of adversarial feedback C, which be impractical in certain scenarios. In this subsection,
we extend our previous result to address the challenge posed by an unknown number of adversarial
feedback C. Our approach to tackle this uncertainty is straightforward: we introduce an adversarial
tolerance threshold C¯ for the adversary count. This threshold can be regarded as an optimistic
estimator of the actual number of adversarial feedback C. Under this situation, the subsequent
theorem provides an upper bound for regret of Algorithm 1 in the case of an unknown number of
adversarial feedback C.
Theorem 5.7. Under Assumptions 3.1 and 3.3, if we set the the confidence radius as
√ (cid:16) (cid:113) (cid:17)
β = λB+ αC¯ + dlog(cid:0) (1+2T/λ)/δ(cid:1) /κ,

C¯, then we have

Regret(T) = O(cid:101)(d T +dC¯).
• If the actual number of adversarial feedback C is larger than the adversarial tolerance threshold
C¯, then we have Regret(T) = O(T).
Remark 5.8. For the weak adversary discussed in Remark 3.4, the COBE framework (Wei et al.,
2022) can be applied to adapt an algorithm with a known corruption level C to an algorithm facing
an unknown corruption level. However, our focus is on the strong adversary, and our results are
optimal in the following sense. Theorem 4.12 in He et al. (2022) demonstrates that any linear
bandit algorithm with an optimal regret upper bound in an uncorrupted setting will fail when the
√
corruption level exceeds Ω( T), where T is the total number of steps. This result also extends to
√
the domain of dueling bandits. When the corruption level reaches C¯ = Ω( T), every algorithm that
is optimal when uncorrupted will incur linear regret. Thus, it is impossible to design an algorithm
that adapts to an unknown level of corruption while maintaining efficient performance guarantees
in the uncorrupted case.
9Remark 5.9. It is important to highlight that the effectiveness of our algorithm is highly related to
the choice of the pre-defined adversarial tolerance threshold C¯. When this threshold is conservative,
our algorithm fails to provide a non-trivial performance guarantee. Conversely, an excessively
optimistic adversarial tolerance threshold C¯ can defend against a diverse range of attacks but may
deteriorate the overall algorithmic performance. Therefore, there exists a trade-off between robust
adversarial defense and near-optimal algorithmic performance. For a special scenario, when we set
√ √
C¯ = O(cid:101)( T), our algorithm achieves O(cid:101)(d T) regret. This result implies that our algorithm can
exhibit similar performance as the no-adversary case, even in the presence of an unknown number
√
of adversarial feedback C ≤ T.
6 Roadmap of the Proof
6.1 Uncertainty-weighted MLE with Adversarial Feedback
In this section, we offer an overview of the proof for Lemma 5.1. The general proof idea for the
uncertainty-weighted MLE with adversarial feedback lies in decomposing the estimation error into
three terms, a stochastic error term, an adversarial term, and an additional regularization term.
Following the analysis of standard (weighted) MLE (Li et al., 2017), we introduce an auxiliary
function:
t−1
(cid:88) (cid:104) (cid:16) (cid:0) (cid:1)⊤ (cid:17)
G (θ) = λκθ+ w σ ϕ(x ,a )−ϕ(x ,b ) θ

i i i i i i i i
It satisfies two conditions: First, for the true parameter value θ∗, G (θ∗) has a simple expression,
t
i.e.,
G (θ∗) = λκθ∗.

Second, according to (4.4), we can get the value of function G at the MLE θ ,

where γ = o
−σ(cid:0)
(ϕ(x ,a )−ϕ(x ,b

. To connect the desired estimation error with the
t t t t t t
function G , we use the mean value theorem. This leads to an upper bound of the estimation error:

∥θ t−θ∗∥ Σt ≤ κ1(cid:13) (cid:13)G t(θ t)−G t(θ∗)(cid:13) (cid:13) Σ− t1 ≤ κ1 λ∥θ∗∥ Σ− t1 + κ1(cid:13) (cid:13)G t(θ t)(cid:13) (cid:13) Σ− t1.

The stochastic term can be upper bounded with the concentration inequality (Lemma C.2). Addi-
tionally, by employing our specifically chosen weight, as (4.2), we can control the adversarial term,
with w ∥ϕ(x ,a )−ϕ(x ,b )∥ ≤ α. Therefore, the adversarial term can be bounded by αC/κ.

117 Experiments
7.1 Experiment Setup
Preference Model. We study the effect of adversarial feedback with the preference model
determined by (3.1), where σ(x) = 1/(1+e−x). We randomly generate the underlying parameter in
[−0.5,0.5]d and normalize it to be a vector with ∥θ∗∥ = 2. Then, we set it to be the underlying
2
parameter and construct the reward utilized in the preference model as r∗(x,a) = ⟨θ∗,ϕ(x,a)⟩. We
√ √
(cid:8) (cid:9)d
set the action set A = −1/ d,1/ d . For simplicity, we assume ϕ(x,a) = a. In our experiment,
we set the dimension d = 5, with the size of action set |A| = 2d = 32.
Adversarial Attack Methods. We study the performance of our algorithm using different
adversarial attack methods. We categorize the first two methods as “weak” primarily because the
adversary in these scenarios does not utilize information about the agent’s actions. In contrast,
we classify the latter two methods as “strong” attacks. In these cases, the adversary leverages a
broader scope of information, including knowledge of the actions selected by the agent and the true
preference model. This enables it to devise more targeted adversarial methods.
•“Greedy Attack”: The adversary will flip the preference label for the first C rounds. After that, it
will not corrupt the result anymore.
•“Random Attack”: At each round, the adversary will flip the preference label with the probability
of 0 < p < 1, until the times of adversarial feedback reach C.
•“Adversarial Attack”: The adversary can have access to the true preference model. It will only
flip the preference label when it aligns with the preference model, i.e., the probability for the
preference model to make that decision is larger than 0.5, until the times of adversarial feedback
reach C.
•“Misleading Attack”: The adversary selects a suboptimal action. It will make sure this arm is
always the winner in the comparison until the times of adversarial feedback reach C. In this way,
it will mislead the agent to believe this action is the optimal one.
Experiment Setup. For each experiment instance, we simulate the interaction with the environ-
ment for T = 2000 rounds. At each round, the feedback for the action pair selected by the algorithm
is generated according to the defined preference model. Subsequently, the adversary observes both
the selected actions and their corresponding feedback and then engages in one of the previously
described adversarial attack methods. We report the regret defined in (3.2) averaged across 10
random runs.
7.2 Performance Comparison
We first introduce the algorithms studied in this section.
• MaxInP: Maximum Informative Pair by Saha (2021). It involves maintaining a standard MLE.
With the estimated model, it then identifies a set of promising arms possible to beat the rest. The
selection of arm pairs is then strategically designed to maximize the uncertainty in the difference
between the two arms within this promising set, referred to as “maximum informative”.

Figure 1: Comparison of RCDB (Our Algorithm 1), MaxInp (Saha, 2021), CoLSTIM (Bengs et al.,
2022) and MaxPairUCB (Di et al., 2023). We report the cumulative regret with various adversarial
attack methods (Greedy, Random, Adversarial, Misleading). For the baselines, the parameters
are carefully tuned to achieve better results with different attack methods. The total number of
√
(cid:6) (cid:7)
adversarial feedback is C = T .
• CoLSTIM: The method by Bengs et al. (2022). It involves maintaining a standard MLE for the
estimated model. Based on this model, the first arm is selected as the one with the highest
estimated reward, implying it is the most likely to prevail over competitors. The second arm is
selected to be the first arm’s toughest competitor, with an added uncertainty bonus.
• MaxPairUCB: This algorithm was proposed in Di et al. (2023). It uses the regularized MLE to
estimate the parameter θ∗. Then it selects the actions based on a symmetric action selection rule,
i.e. the actions with the largest estimated reward plus some uncertainty bonus.
• RCDB: Algorithm 1 proposed in this paper. The key difference from the other algorithms is the
use of uncertainty weight in the calculation of MLE (4.4). The we use the same symmetric action
selection rule as MaxPairUCB. Our experiment results show that the uncertainty weight is critical
in the face of adversarial feedback.
Our results are demonstrated in Figure 1. In Figure 1(a) and Figure 1(b), we observe scenarios
where the adversary is “weak” due to the lack of access to information regarding the selected actions
and the underlying preference model. Notably, in these situations, our algorithm RCDB outperforms
all other baseline algorithms, demonstrating its robustness. Among the other algorithms, CoLSTIM
performs as the strongest competitor.
In Figure 1(c), the adversary employs a ’stronger’ adversarial method. Due to the inherent
randomness of the model, some labels may naturally be ’incorrect’. An adversary with knowledge
of the selected actions and the preference model can strategically neglect these naturally incorrect
labels and selectively flip the others. This method proves catastrophic for algorithms to learn the
true model, as it results in the agent encountering only incorrect preference labels at the beginning.
Our results indicate that this leads to significantly higher regret. However, it’s noteworthy that our
algorithm RCDB demonstrates considerable robustness.
In Figure 1(d), the adversary employs a strategy aimed at misleading algorithms into believing
a suboptimal action is the best choice. The algorithm CoLSTIM appears to be the most susceptible
to being cheated by this method. Despite the deployment of ’strong’ adversarial methods, as shown
in both Figure 1(c) and Figure 1(d), our algorithm, RCDB, consistently demonstrates exceptional
robustness against these attacks. A significant advantage of RCDB lies in that our parameter is
selected solely based on the number of adversarial feedback C, irrespective of the nature of the
adversarial methods employed. This contrasts with other algorithms where parameter tuning must

7.3 Robustness to Different Numbers of Adversarial Feedback
In this section, we test the performance of algorithms with increasing times of adversarial feedback.
Our results show a linear dependency on the number of adversarial feedback C, which is consistent
with the theoretical results we have proved in Theorem 5.3 and 5.5. In comparison to other
algorithms, RCDB demonstrates superior robustness against adversarial feedback, as evidenced by its
notably smaller regret.
8 Conclusion
In this paper, we focus on the contextual dueling bandit problem from adversarial feedback. We
introduce a novel algorithm, RCDB, which utilizes an uncertainty-weighted Maximum Likelihood
Estimator (MLE) approach. This algorithm not only achieves optimal theoretical results in scenarios
with and without adversarial feedback but also demonstrates superior performance with synthetic
data. For future direction, we aim to extend our uncertainty-weighted method to encompass more
general settings involving preference-based data. A particularly promising future direction of our
research lies in addressing adversarial feedback within the process of aligning large language models
using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF).

A.2 Proof of Theorem 5.5
Proof of Theorem 5.5. Our proof adapts the argument in Bogunovic et al. (2021) to dueling bandits.
For any dimension d, we construct d instances, each with θ = e , where e is the i-th standard
i i i
basis vector. We set the action set A = {e }d . Therefore, in the i-th instance, the reward for the
i i=1
i-th action will be 1. For the other actions, it will be 0. Therefore, the i-th action will be more
preferable to any other action. While for other pairs, the feedback is simply a random guess.
Consider an adversary that knows the exact instance. When the comparison involves the i-th
action, it will corrupt the feedback with a random guess. Otherwise, it will not corrupt. In the i-th
instance, the adversary stops the adversarial attack only after C times of comparison involving the
i-th action. However, after Cd/4 rounds, at least d/2 actions have not been compared for C times.
For the instances corresponding to these actions, the agent learns no information and suffers from
Ω(dC) regret. This completes the proof of Theorem 5.5.
A.3 Proof of Theorem 5.7
Proof of Theorem 5.7. Here, based on the relationship between C and the threshold C¯, we discuss
two distinct cases separately.
• In the scenario where C¯ < C, Algorithm 1 can ensures a trivial regret bound, with the guarantee
that Regret(T) ≤ 2T.
• In the scenario where C ≤ C¯, we know that C¯ is remains a valid upper bound on the number of
adversarial feedback. Under this situation, Algorithm 1 operates successfully with C¯ adversarial
feedback. Therefore, according to Theorem 5.3, the regret is upper bounded by

Regret(T) ≤ O(cid:101)(d T +dC¯).
