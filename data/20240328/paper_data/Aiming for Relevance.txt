Abstract
Vital signs are crucial in intensive care units (ICUs). They are used to track the patient’s state and to identify
clinically significant changes. Predicting vital sign trajectories is valuable for early detection of adverse events.
However, conventional machine learning metrics like RMSE often fail to capture the true clinical relevance of
such predictions. We introduce novel vital sign prediction performance metrics that align with clinical contexts,
focusing on deviations from clinical norms, overall trends, and trend deviations. These metrics are derived from
empirical utility curves obtained in a previous study through interviews with ICU clinicians. We validate the
metrics’ usefulness using simulated and real clinical datasets (MIMIC and eICU). Furthermore, we employ
these metrics as loss functions for neural networks, resulting in models that excel in predicting clinically
significant events. This research paves the way for clinically relevant machine learning model evaluation and
optimization, promising to improve ICU patient care.
Introduction
Intensive care medicine is dedicated to treating critically-ill individuals who frequently contend with multiple
physiological systems disturbances. Specialized healthcare professionals, including physicians and nurses,
continuously track and estimate the patients’ physiological state. These estimates serve as a foundation for making
informed decisions regarding treatments and interventions. Moreover, given the patients' often unstable condition,
their clinical state can rapidly change over minutes. Vital signs, namely basic physiological variables such as heart
rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate and arterial oxygen saturation are used both to track the patient’s state and to
identify clinically significant changes. Predicting vital sign trajectories is valuable for early detection of possible
adverse changes and to help in guiding treatment choices or intensity of monitoring4,8. This value stems from the
capacity of such predictions to represent a patient's condition in a continuous manner, thereby assisting in the reduction
of alarm fatigue and offering distinct and actionable insights to guide clinical practice. Consequently, predicting vital
signs of hospitalized patients is a prevalent task in the domain of machine learning (ML) for healthcare1,2,3,5, and
clinicians from all fields express a keen interest in real-time systems for vital sign trajectory prediction4,8.
Recent advances in deep learning now allow effective end-to-end learning of models almost directly from
physiological data2,5,9,10. Most vital signs prediction models approach the problem as an isolated machine learning
task, typically focusing on optimizing the root mean squared error (RMSE), or occasionally mean absolute percentage
error (MAPE). However, ultimately such ML models are anticipated to function in conjunction with clinical experts
as decision support tools; while metrics such as RMSE offer an overall assessment of performance, they assume equal
importance for all predictions, which is often not the case when considering clinical utility4.
As an example, accurately predicting a sudden drop in blood pressure typically holds much greater clinical benefit
than correctly predicting no change. In the extreme, a naïve static prediction “model” which simply predicts that the
value for the next time step would equal the current value, may yield respectable RMSE performance. This is primarily
because patients often exhibit stability, even within an ICU setting - marked changes in state are rare, but extremely
important to correctly predict. Consider the scenario where accurate predictions are made for a stable patient's vitals
for 48 hours, but miss their deterioration in the final hour, thus averaging the mistake with prior successes, while
exhibiting low clinical utility. Thus, exclusive reliance on RMSE or similar metrics may obscure severe errors while
magnifying simple successes, resulting in an incomplete representation of the model's practical relevance. A possible
solution might be transitioning to a classification problem for adverse events, thus eliminating the reliance on RMSE.
However, event categorization within vital sign trajectories entails layers of complexity, by requiring the
differentiation and labeling of diverse event types with arbitrary threshold values, each possessing unique clinical
implications. While anomaly detection methods can effectively identify sudden surges, they may not be as applicableto longer events that persist in extreme values. Moreover, the deployment of any event-based systems (be they
supervised or unsupervised) in the ICU is fraught with the risks of alarm fatigue and cognitive overloading.
In this work, we propose novel performance measures for vital sign prediction, intended to complement the classic
RMSE. The goal of the new measures is to focus on dimensions of performance that align with clinical relevance as
expressed by practicing clinicians. Specifically, we build on prior research by Eini-Porat et al.4, where ICU clinicians
were interviewed to assess the relevance of ML predictions of vital signs. The study identified three primary aspects
of vital sign predictions that matter most in terms of utility for clinicians: vital sign values deviating from clinical
normal ranges; overall vital sign trends; and deviations from those trends. These aspects were first identified via vital
signs annotations tasks, then quantified by using utility ranking tasks in which clinicians ranked their interest in
predictions across varying intervals, and context. This process produced aspect-specific utility curves, illustrating how
perceived clinical utility changes in relation to values and trends. In this paper, we mathematically formulate utility
metrics based on these empirically determined curves. We then use these metrics both as means for model evaluation,
and as optimization goals for learning models which align more closely with clinical utility.
We first assess the effectiveness of the novel metrics by applying them to a simulated dataset with predetermined
events that serve as ground truth to evaluate the metrics' ability to accurately capture these events, demonstrating their
utility as evaluation measures for model selection. We then apply our models to clinical datasets of critically-ill
patients, namely MIMIC III6 and eICU7 subsets, using real vital signs data to compare the clinical utility of different
models.We further incorporate these metrics as loss terms for deep neural networks (DNNs). We show that models
learned with the novel loss function perform better on the clinically relevant events both in simulation and real vital
signs annotated by human experts. We hope these results will encourage the community to move towards more
clinically-oriented modes of model evaluation and optimization.
Methods
We introduce three utility-based costs which correspond to clinically significant aspects of a vital signs’ behavior4: (i)
exceeding clinical normal range, (ii) overall trend, and (iii) trend deviations. We use these utility costs in two ways:
The first is as evaluation metrics which allow different perspectives on the performance of any given prediction model.
The second is as optimization targets, specifically as loss terms for DNNs, aiming to promote model performance
which aligns more closely with each of these three aspects of clinical utility.
Design
Utility Costs: Formulation
According to clinicians, perceived clinical utility is directly related to clinical severity and surprise, i.e. how
unexpected a trajectory is. High or low absolute values are important as they describe clinically severe states - a patient
with a predicted heart rate of 180 BPM is probably in danger. General trend hints at clinical severity even if the
absolute values are not severe just yet - the clinical staff could be missing a deterioration. As for sudden deviations
from the trend, a sudden change could be a symptom of a clinical event or simply less likely to be predicted by the
clinical staff and therefore novel. Here we mathematically formulate utility curves that capture each aspect, in the
form of functions that measure the utility cost of giving a certain prediction with respect to the ground truth.
Normal Range
As found by Eini-Porat et al.4, measurements’ clinical importance follows a sigmoidal pattern around the norm
thresholds, with vital sign values perceived as more important as they exceed the clinical norm. However, at some
extreme values further deviations from norm do not lead to a change in perceived clinical importance since the patient
is likely already experiencing an event demanding attention. In the prevalent case where there are both lower and
upper bounds for the acceptable range of a vital sign, the curve would manifest as two mirror sigmoid functions; see
for example Figure 1 for heartrate4.Figure 1. Normal range utility: heart rate example. The values between the red lines are the clinically normal range.
The blue curve is the calculated normal range utility curve.
To capture this behavior, we define the normal range utility cost as follows:
Equation (1), normal range utility cost:
𝐿 𝐿 𝐿 𝐿
𝑈(𝑦 ,𝑦% )=()𝑚𝑎𝑥) ,02+𝑚𝑎𝑥) ,022− )𝑚𝑎𝑥) ,02+𝑚𝑎𝑥) ,022 (,
! " " 1+𝑒#! ⋅(’"()) 1+𝑒## ⋅(’"(+) 1+𝑒#! ⋅(’,"()) 1+𝑒## ⋅(’,"(+)
where 𝑦 represents the true value and 𝑦% prediction at time 𝑡, and 𝑈 (𝑦 ,𝑦& ) is the utility cost of predicting 𝑦% while
! " " ! 𝑡 "
the true signal is 𝑦 . The terms represents a two-sided sigmoid, for example the blue curve in Figure 1. The parameters
!
𝐿, 𝑘 , 𝑘 ,ℎ,𝑙 correspond to low and high threshold sigmoids: 𝐿, 𝑘 , and 𝑘 indicate the magnitude and shape of these
# $ $ #
sigmoid curves, while 𝑙, ℎ refer to the range thresholds. These parameters enable adaptation to various vital signs and
the portrayal of any of the clinical norm utility curves identified by Eini-Porat et al4. Looking at Figure 1, we can see
that, all else being equal, 𝑈 (𝑦 ,𝑦& ) will attain larger values when the prediction is for a normal range value but the
" ! 𝑡
outcome is out of normal range, or vice versa.
Trends
To establish the utility measures for overall trend and trend deviation, we start with some definitions:
(1) The expected trend 𝑌( refers to the slope of the vital over the preceding 𝑛 steps, (2) Actual trend 𝑌 is
!%&:! !%&:!)*
the true signal slope over the past 𝑛 and extending to the subsequent 𝑚 intervals and (3) Predicted trend 𝑌0 is
!%&:!)*
the projected slope for the next 𝑚 steps, based on the previous 𝑛 steps as estimated by a ML model (see Figure 2). We
note that the size of 𝑛 and 𝑚 may vary based on frequency of the vital sign measurement. For example, a high
frequency vital sign is more susceptible to noise compared to low frequency ones, thereby introducing noise to these
measures. Consequently in such cases larger values of 𝑛 and 𝑚 might be necessary to mitigate noise.

Th e pink arrow represents the predicted trend 𝑌0, the light blue arrow represents the actual trend 𝑌 , and blue
! !%&:!)*
arrow is the expected trend 𝑌( .
!%&:!The Trend utility error considers the disparity between actual and predicted trends, using a quadratic loss - a slight
trend change could be benign, but a sharper one might indicate an underlying event unfolding. Indeed, clinicians'
utility does not increase linearly; it rises rapidly as the trend becomes steeper4. We note that trend prediction costs
might not be symmetric, for example a drop in blood pressure could be more dangerous than an equal-sized surge.
The following formulation allows for such asymmetries through the non-negative weighting terms 𝑤,𝑤 .

While the trend and clinical norm aspects were captured by utility curves in Eini-Porat et al.’s study, the trend deviation
aspect was not directly quantified. Yet its significance to clinicians is paramount, as they frequently mentioned it in
various scenarios. We propose a trend deviation utility measure which is the trend prediction errors, but weighted by
the difference of expected (by linear extrapolation) and actual trends, or “how surprising is that trend?”.

Utility Costs: Evaluation and Optimization
Given a time-series of vital signs and vital sign predictions, each of the three utility costs 𝑈 ,𝑈,𝑈 can be readily
" + +-
calculated and averaged over time and over signals. We use these averages both as metrics to evaluate the utility costs
of given models (evaluation), and as terms in loss functions for deep neural networks trained in mini-batches over the
dataset (optimization).
For evaluation, we train multiple ML models (see Models) to predict the next measurement using three datasets. First,
a simulated vital signs dataset is used, where input data from the previous three time steps is utilized as input.
Subsequently, we use two clinical ICU datasets with the objective of predicting mean blood pressure in the next 30-
minute interval within a 24-hour period. Our primary objective in evaluating the simulated dataset is to validate the
newly proposed utility costs. With the ground truth of event locations, we can assess the utility costs' ability to
accurately capture them. The evaluation on clinical datasets, on the other hand, represents a real-world use case where
we can measure the added value of these metrics in the model selection process.
For optimization, we aim to actively improve the utility-based costs of a model. We train DNNs (LSTM) with loss
functions incorporating terms based on each utility aspect, for example: 𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠=𝑀𝑆𝐸
𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠+𝜆⋅.∑𝑈
, to examine
& +"
whether they could promote the corresponding utility costs. The combination with the standard squared loss is
necessary as some of loss terms lead to objective functions that deviate from target signal. Similarly to the evaluation
phase, we train to predict the next measurement over the three datasets. Finally, we train a mixed utility model using
a training regimen that integrates loss terms of different aspects. We assess the performance of this model on a small
annotated eICU subset, which includes mixed event annotations.
Models and training
We train different ML models for both phases, including Linear regression, Ridge regression, Bayesian ridge,
XGBoost regressor (all using scikit-learn11) and LSTMs using pytorch12. Results are reported for 5-fold cross
validation. LSTM models architecture comprises an encoding layer, a 2-layer LSTM structure and a fully connected
final layer. In the optimization phase the proposed utility-based errors find application as loss terms within Deep
Neural Networks (DNNs). These measures, however, often prioritize behaviors that compete with accuracy. The
intricate balance between accuracy and these measures necessitates a warm start training regime. Initial training
prioritizes accuracy through MSE optimization, succeeded by a subsequent fine-tuning phase involving utility loss
terms, progressively escalating the utility loss coefficient 𝜆. In the optimization of multiple cost terms, a new utility
cost was introduced only after the stabilization of the previous cost components. The λ hyperparameter was selected
to balance loss terms while maintaining the same scale of values across the utility metrics.
Datasets
Simulation
In this work we challenge the heavy reliance on standard evolution metrics and propose new measures to complement
them. We first wish to show that these measures work as intended in a controlled situation. Thus, we generate asynthetic vital signs simulation where we artificially introduce several types of events on top of a continuous signal.
We then test the new metrics compared to RMSE over the time windows corresponding to the introduced events.
The simulation consists of 5 variables describing the base periodic process. These variables are constructed as follows
for patient 𝑖 at time 𝑡:
𝑎 ~ uniform(18,80) is a static “demographic” parameter.

𝑔~ 𝑏𝑖𝑛(0.5) is a static “demographic” parameter.

it depends on previous measurements of 𝑠 ,𝑠 . These baseline variables are embedded with different types of events:

rare sudden events and evolving trend events. These events are generated separately and added to the relevant signals.
For rare sudden events, we introduce events of two types. The first is a sudden drop with fixed size 7 in 𝑠 which leads

a surge in the next time step of 𝑠 . The drop occurs with small probability 𝑝 =7⋅10%2 per time step, given that the

, 1,
to 𝑠 with probability 𝑝 =1⋅10%2 per time step and a random duration 𝑑 ~Unifrom[0,10]. We note that for the
1 11 1
evaluation we considered an additional event type, range events, which are the cases where measurements were further
than 2 standard deviations from the mean. We generate a simulated dataset with 1000 patients each with 500 time
steps, with an average of 1.5 events per patient.
Clinical Datasets
Our goal is to predict vital sign trajectories for hospitalized patients. To this end, we used two open ICU databases:
MIMIC-III and eICU, focusing on heart rate and blood pressure signals. The MIMIC-III Waveform Database6
Matched Subset contains thousands of waveform records of ICU patients hospitalized in critical care units of the Beth
Israel Deaconess Medical Center between 2001 and 2012. This database is a subset of the MIMIC-III Waveform
Database, representing those records matched clinical records are available in the MIMIC-III Clinical Database
containing electronic health records. Since the prediction target is primarily next step heartrate prediction during a 24
hours window, only records with heartrate waveforms recordings with durations that exceeded 12 hours were selected
yielding 284 patient records. Features extracted from MIMIC-III Clinical Database and aggregated to half an hour
window in accordance with ICU clinicians desired prediction time scales4. The feature set includes pervious
aggregated heartrate mean and standard deviation, mean atrial pressure and standard deviation from the waveform
dataset, merge with clinical dataset features age, gender, weight, height, respiratory rate, systolic and diastolic blood
pressure, temperature, SpO2 and a “pain present” indicator.
The eICU Collaborative Research Database7 is a large dataset containing over 200,000 records gathered from hundreds
critical care units throughout the continental United States. The data in the collaborative database covers patients who
were admitted to critical care units in 2014 and 2015. Due to compute limitations 1,000 patient admissions were
sampled out of this dataset. The features we use consist of previous heart rate, blood pressure, SpO2, respiration rate,
temperature aggregated to 30 minutes steps and age and gender. To reduce noise, records with at least 50% of the
SpO2 and respiration rate data present during the times when heartrate measurement is present were selected, leaving
389 records.
Finally, as an external validation we collected vital signs annotations for small subset of 45 signals of eICU subset by
4 different clinicians (3 residents and 1 nurse). Annotators were instructed to mark segment of the heartrate signal
which they would consider important to predict. They were compensated with coffee vouchers worth ~10$. The
annotation task was approved by our institutional IRB.Main outcome measurement
To validate the proposed metrics, we compute the proposed utility measures and contrast them with the calculated
RMSE over the various types of simulation events. Then, we assess whether these metrics provided any additional
value compared to the overall RMSE-based evaluation across all datasets.
In the optimization phase, we examine whether training with a given utility loss leads to different model behavior, and
whether it leads to lower utility costs of the model when evaluated on held-out data. This examination allows us to
evaluate whether training to improve utility is at all possible. We note that in real-world scenarios, these utility costs
are likely to be the sole quantitative measure to check for training success. Finally, we assess the RMSE of a baseline
LSTM model and the Mixed model (an LSTM optimizing all utilities jointly) over time windows corresponding to
clinical events as annotated by clinicians in the eICU dataset.
Results
Simulation dataset
Evaluation. Figure 3 illustrates the contrast between the costs assigned by RMSE and by 𝑈 with respect to identical
+-
model behavior. While both assign penalties for missing the drop event around 𝑡=70, RMSE is noisier and assigns
penalties to small prediction mismatches throughout the signal.

!
(blue) for the simulated signal 𝑠 . The middle and bottom panels display RMSE and 𝑈 cost, respectively. The 𝑈
1 +- +-
cost is only sensitive to the sharp mismatch at the “drop” event.
At the macro level, we show in Figure 4 that over the three event types - range, trend, and trend deviation - models
with low utility cost have low RMSE when measured specifically over the time window of the corresponding event.
Thus, selecting models based on utility costs would lead to models which are more accurate around specific types
events, possibly at the expense of higher overall RMSE.Figure 4. Simuation data: The top row presents RMSE over different types of events per model. On the bottom is
the corresponding utility cost tested for the same models.
Optimization. In Figure 5 we see the ground truth signal as well as predictions made by two LSTM models: one
trained with standard squared loss, and one trained with an additional trend deviation utility cost term. We see that the
utility term encourages the model to be more precise over the surge event near 𝑡=100, at the expense of slightly
lower accuracy diffused over the rest of the signal, including a more minor surge around 𝑡=50.

component (orange) for 5000 epochs. With less training, the utility oriented model proves to be more accurate on
sudden events.
In Figure 6, we show the performance of LSTM models trained with different utility costs, including a baseline model
with only the squared loss. We examine performance in terms of RMSE over the intervals containing the three types
of rare events we introduced into the signals, as well as performance in terms of the utility costs. We see the correlation
between RMSE on the events and the corresponding utility metrics. We further see that models trained with the
relevant utility cost indeed perform better with respect to that utility.Figure 6. Simulation data: Performance of LSTMs trained with utility loss, in terms of RMSE over events of
different types, as well as the corresponding utility metrics. Baseline LSTM is marked as ‘LSTM’, the Clinical range
trained model is marked as ‘Range_LSTM’, the model trained for overall trend as ‘LSTM_Trend’ and the model
trained for trend deviations is ‘LSTM_Dev’.
Clinical Datasets
Evaluation. Figure 7 presents the performance on MIMIC and eICU blood pressure prediction task of four standard
machine learning models. The results are presented in terms of RMSE and in terms of the three utility costs we
introduce; all results are on held-out data. Using the standard RMSE loss, the XGBoost model demonstrates superior
performance, whereas the LSTM model lags notably. However, a different picture emerges when we look at the other
utility costs: the LSTM model significantly outperforms the other models for trend and trend deviation, while still
underperforming for the range utility cost. . These distinct behavioral patterns of the LSTM models underscore the

of the three utility costs is shown. The top row depicts these measures per model for the eICU dataset, and the bottom
row depicts the same measures for the MIMIC dataset.
necessity for a context-sensitive ranking, influenced by deployment considerations. In the process of model selection,
a superficial reliance on RMSE might lead to dismissing LSTM, but the comprehensive range of measures suggests
that LSTM should have merited consideration and potentially even selection, contingent upon the specific objectives
of the task. We obtained similar results in the model selection for a heartrate prediction tasks across both datasets.Optimization.
When optimizing over the MIMIC subset we observed that training led to a decrease in all utility losses. However, we
also observed some mild instability in the range utility cost, where a certain split in the 5-fold validation failed to
achieve an adequate baseline performance. While a reduction in utility loss is achieved over eICU subset, the
improvements seem less significant, possibly due to the high rate of missingness, hindering the learning process.

trained additionally with 𝑈 component (orange). The utility-optimized model captures more events. In the bottom

row, the blue and orange bars overlap.
In Figure 8 we present the performance of an LSTM trained with standard squared loss vs. an LSTM trained with an
addition trend deviation term, on the task of predicting mean heartrate in the eICU dataset. We see that both models
have some errors with respect to the true signal, but the trend deviation model captures several of the spiking events
more accurately.
Finally, we compare the performance of a standard LSTM model trained with square loss, with an LSTM model
trained with a combination of all three utility measures, which we call a Mixed model. We use the annotated dataset
where clinicians marked heartrate segments which they deemed clinically significant, and which could correspond to
each of three clinical utility aspects we outlined, or indeed any other aspect that came to their mind, marking overall
94 events over 45 patients with average length of 15 steps. The held-out RMSE over the entire signal for the baseline
model is 1.205 while the corresponding RMSE of the Mixed model is only slight better at 1.167. However, the Mixed
model had a greater advantage in RMSE taken only over the annotated events 1.276 compared to 1.485 for the baseline.
A paired t-test over the 94 events gives a statistic of -1.96 with a p-value of 0.056. In Figure 9 we present a histogram
of the differences in RMSE over the annotated events.

Conclusions
In this work we argue that for ML-based vital sign prediction models to be truly useful in practice, their evaluation
should consider clinically relevant aspects of the prediction problem. We thus introduce new utility measures of model
performance whose goal is to complement standard metrics such as RMSE. The idea behind these new measures is
the recognition that a prediction’s meaning is context-dependent, encompassing both clinical and temporal contexts.The newly introduced metrics are applicable to model selection and model optimization whenever vital sign prediction
is the target. This allows overcoming the problem of models which are accurate on average over the entire time-series,
but in fact perform poorly with respect to clinical goals. The defined utility costs provide a way to influence the
model's emphasis, for example prioritizing trend prediction or deviations from clinical norm.
During the optimization phase, while we anticipated a more distinct trade-off between utility costs and RMSE, we
found it noteworthy that overall RMSE exhibited only a slight reduction following training with any of the utility
measures in both datasets. This phenomenon could potentially be attributed to the utility loss measures serving as
regularization factors within the training process. An inherent limitation of a work calling for new evaluation metrics
is how can one evaluate novel metrics, given that they are meant to highlight shortcomings of existing metrics. We
attempted to overcome this limitation using both a simulated dataset and annotations from clinicians over real vital
sign signals, showing that training a model with the proposed costs possibly leads to smaller error on annotated events
thus indicating its clinical usefulness.
It is our hope that the introduction of these new metrics will enhance vital signs prediction models, given their
perceived utility by ICU clinicians4. Although our work primarily focuses on vital sign predictions, the next step
involves exploring the incorporation of these metrics into a larger, more comprehensive model for patient state and
patient deterioration. Indeed, while the proposed utility costs mark a step forward in this direction, it is worth noting
that the incorporation of context could be extended further. The interplay between vital signs could also offer insights
into clinical severity and surprise within each of the three aspects: clinical norm, overall trend, and trend deviation.
Additionally, the integration of general EHR data and clinical knowledge bases is a possibility – for instance, a drop
in heart rate following prescribed medication may be expected and non-concerning. Another future direction could
focus on the implications of deploying models learned with different utility costs in the ICU environment, and how
are they perceived by practicing clinicians in the field. Finally, the newly introduced utility costs could be found in
the field of interpretability. Such scores could be utilized for detecting samples with high clinical value for a review
of the model performance.
