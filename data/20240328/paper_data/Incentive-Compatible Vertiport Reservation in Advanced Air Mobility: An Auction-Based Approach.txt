Advanced air mobility (AAM) encompasses the utilization of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs),
air taxis, and various cargo and passenger transport solutions. This innovative approach taps into
previously unexplored airspace, poised to revolutionize urban airspace. A recent report forecasts
the air mobility market alone to exceed US$50 billion by 2035, underlining this area’s immense
growth potential (Cohen et al., 2021).
Despite the widespread optimism surrounding AAM, the design of regulatory policies remains
anopenproblem. Whileideasfromconventionalairtrafficframeworkcouldbeleveraged(Bertsimas
and Patterson, 1998, 2000; Bertsimas et al., 2011; Odoni, 1987; Roy and Tomlin, 2007), they often
fall short in accommodating the dynamic and adaptable nature of AAM operations (Bichler et al.,
2023). Unlike traditional aviation, AAM requires a more flexible regulatory approach to be able
to handle on-demand operations comprising of broader spectrum of arrival and departure points
(Seuken et al., 2022; Skorup, 2019).
Administrativemanagementmethodsprevalentinconventionalairspace,suchasgrand-fathering
rights, flow management, and first-come-first-serve, prove ineffective for AAM operations (Evans
et al.; Guerreiro et al.). These approaches fail to elicit the heterogeneous private valuations (arising
from different aircraft specifications, demand realization, etc.) different operators have on using
AAM resources. Furthermore, they risk fostering inefficient and anti-competitive outcomes, as
evidenced in traditional airspace operations (Dixit et al., 2023). Recognizing the need for tai-
lored regulation, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is actively developing a clean-slate
congestion management framework for AAM operations to ensure efficiency, fairness, and safety
(Administration, 2023).
Market-basedcongestionmanagementmechanismshavebeenproposedaspotentialsolutionsfor
AAM operations (Chin et al., 2023b; Evans et al.; Qin and Balakrishnan, 2022; Seuken et al., 2022;
Skorup, 2019; Wang et al., 2023). In this paper, we study an auction-based mechanism for AAM
congestion management. Even in conventional airspace management, auction-based mechanisms
are extensively studied such as (Ball et al., 2018; Basso and Zhang, 2010; Carlin and Park, 1970;
Mehta and Vazirani, 2020), where both theoretical and empirical evidence show their precedence
over administrative approaches (Dixit et al., 2023). Despite being a plausible direction, auction-
ing airspace is rarely adopted in conventional airspace due to intricate and inflexible government
regulations in conventional airspace operations (Bichler et al., 2023).
2Figure 1: Schematic representation of the air traffic network with multiple service providers, each
operating in non-overlapping operation regime, tasked with coordinating the movement of aircraft
of various fleet operators between vertiports in its domain. Each vertiport has a constraint on the
number of arriving aircraft, departing aircraft, and parked aircraft.
The design of market-based mechanisms that guarantee safety, efficiency, and fairness under
the heterogeneous and on-demand nature of AAM operations has remained elusive. Particularly,
there are two challenges. First, there are computational challenges associated with computing
the auction mechanism. Second, there are challenges to truthfully elicit private information (aka
incentive compatibility) from AAM operators. Existing approaches in AAM operations concentrate
heavily on tactical deconfliction (Bertram and Wei; Kleinbekman et al., 2018), while strategic
trajectories are determined through flow management frameworks or other protocols which do not
account for economic incentives (Chin et al., 2021, 2023a,b; Evans et al.; Guerreiro et al.; Qin
and Balakrishnan, 2022; Sun et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023). Facing these issues, we propose a
vertiport reservation mechanism, based on auction theory, that can be integrated into the airborne
automation workflow proposed in (Wei et al., 2023). Particularly, the main motivating question
in this work is as follows.
How do we design an incentive-compatible vertiport reservation mechanism that can
accommodate the heterogeneous nature of AAM operations, while having good computa-
tional performance?
3A schematic representation of vertiport reservation problem is presented in Figure 1. Typically,
the air transportation network (ATN) for eVTOL aircraft is envisioned to be divided into several
contiguous regions, each operated by a service provider (SP) (Skorup, 2019). In this work, we focus
on one region of ATN which is managed by a SP, who is responsible for ensuring the efficient, safe,
and fair movement of aircraft between various vertiports. The aircraft are owned by fleet operators
(FOs), and each FO may own multiple aircraft. Each FO submits a menu of routes for each of its
aircraft to SP, for each of which it has private valuation. The SP is then responsible for allocating
different aircraft to routes.
The goal of the SP is to maximize a metric of social welfare that is comprised of two objectives:
(i) maximizing the overall (weighted) valuations of all FOs1, and (ii) minimizing excessive conges-
tionatvertiports. Additionally, theSPmust(iii)ensuresafetybyenforcingarrival, departure, and
parking capacity constraints at vertiports, and (iv) elicit truthful valuations from heterogeneous
FOs in the form of bids. We emphasize that this problem is an “exchange problem”, where some
of the resources desired by any FO could be occupied by aircraft of FOs, and a feasible allocation
in this setting needs to exchange the resources between FOs while respecting capacity constraints.
In contrast, the standard slot allocation problems studied in conventional air traffic literature (cf.
(Ball et al., 2018, 2020; Bichler et al., 2023; Dixit et al., 2023; Mehta and Vazirani, 2020; Pertuiset
and Santos, 2014; Rassenti et al., 1982)) are “assignment problems” where the slots need to be
assigned to airlines and not exchanged between airlines.
In this work, we propose an auction mechanism for the SP that satisfies (i)−(iv). In our pro-
posed mechanism, using the bids submitted by FOs, the SP allocates the resources by maximizing
social welfare, subject to constraints. Additionally, we propose a payment mechanism, inspired
by the generalized Vickrey–Clarke–Groves (VCG) mechanism (Nisan et al., 2007), that ensures
that bids reveal true valuations of FOs. Specifically, each FO is charged a payment based on the
externality imposed by them. Externality imposed by any FO is assessed by the difference in the
optimal social welfare of remaining FOs when this FO is present versus when it is excluded from
the auction environment. We theoretically study properties of the proposed mechanism in terms of
incentive compatibility, individual rationality, and social welfare maximization (cf. Theorem 3.3).
Therearetwocomputationalchallengesassociatedwithdesigningtheauctionmechanism. First,
naively optimizing social welfare over the set of feasible allocations could be computationally chal-
lenging. Therefore, we frame the problem as a mixed integer linear program which is further

4converted to a mixed binary linear program by constructing a network-flow graph which consists
of reduced number of discrete variables. Second, the computation of externality for the payment
mechanism requires characterizing the set of feasible allocations when an FO is excluded from the
auction environment, which is non-trivial as the underlying resource allocation problem is an ex-
change problem. Therefore, we introduce the idea of pseudo-bids, where we simply set a bid of
0 to an FO while computing the optimal allocation when this FO is excluded from the auction
environment.

2 Problem Setup
2.1 System Model
2.1.1 High-level description of model:
We examine an air transportation network (ATN) comprising multiple vertiports, catering to elec-
tric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) fleet operators, each operating multiple eVTOL aircraft.
Our focus lies on a strategic deconfliction mechanism, complementing the tactical deconfliction
algorithms proposed in prior works [(Bertram and Wei; Kleinbekman et al., 2018; Shao et al., 2021;
Wu et al., 2022)]. We tackle the challenge of efficiently coordinating the arrival and departure of
aircraft on the ATN, over a finite time window, by soliciting valuations from fleet operators in the
form of bids2, while ensuring all operational constraints are met.
At the onset of each time window, every fleet operator (FO) submits a comprehensive “menu”
of ”routes” — a detailed list comprising origin-destination pairs along with departure and arrival
times for each aircraft in their fleet. Concurrently, for each route in the menu, they include corre-
sponding bids indicating the amount they are willing to pay should their aircraft be allocated that
specific route. Subsequently, the service provider (SP) undertakes the task of computing a feasible
2Our proposed solution is engineered to operate recurrently, seamlessly spanning consecutive time intervals.
5allocation and corresponding payments, executing them seamlessly throughout the time window.
With allocations finalized, granted aircraft are free to proceed to their desired destinations.
In situations where vertiports face congestion, reaching full parking capacity, any additional
arrivals trigger the simultaneous departure of an aircraft from that vertiport. This dynamic trans-
forms the problem into an “exchange problem” rather than the conventional “assignment problem”
typically encountered in other air traffic allocation scenarios (Ball et al., 2018, 2020; Bichler et al.,
2023; Dixit et al., 2023; Mehta and Vazirani, 2020; Pertuiset and Santos, 2014; Rassenti et al.,
1982).
2.1.2 Detailed description of model:
We denote the set of vertiports by R, the set of FOs by F, and the set of eVTOL aircraft by A. We
consider the problem of scheduling aircraft to and from vertiports over a time window of H time
slots.
Vertiports At any time t ∈ [H], each vertiport r ∈ R has three kind of capacity constraints: (i)
arrival capacity constraints, denoted by arr(r,t) ∈ Z , that restrict the number of eVTOLs that can
+
land at vertiport r at time t; (ii) departure capacity constraints, denoted by dep(r,t) ∈ Z , that
+
restrict the number of eVTOLs that can depart from vertiport r at time t; (iii) parking capacity
constraints, denoted by park(r,t) ∈ Z , that restrict the number of eVTOLs that can park at
+
vertiport r at time t.
Fleet Operators Let A be the fleet of aircraft operated by FO i ∈ F, and A := {a |i ∈ F,j ∈
i i,j
A } be the set of all aircraft using the ATN. Each aircraft a is identified by the following tuple

2.2 Problem Formulation
We consider an SP tasked with coordinating4 the movement of aircraft by allocating them to their
desired vertiports while ensuring that the capacity constraints are met. Formally, the SP needs to
decide on a feasible allocation x = (x ∈ {0,1}|i ∈ F,j ∈ A ,k ∈ m ), where

7time t ∈ [H] is Z(r,t,x) := park(r,t)−S(r,t,x). To ensure the existence of a feasible allocation as
defined later in (2), we assume that park(r,t)−S¯(r) ≥ 0,∀r ∈ R,t ∈ [H].

and (iii) λ ∈ R is the ratio between the congestion cost and the cumulative weighted valuations of

8where ties are resolved arbitrarily.
Remark 2.2. The social welfare objective (3) captures three main desiderata: efficiency, fairness,
and safety. The objective (3) incorporates efficiency through additive valuations of FOs. Addi-
tionally, it incorporates the proportional fairness criterion by assigning different weights to the
valuations of different FOs, denoted by (ρ ) . Well-constructed weights can prevent larger FOs
i i∈F
from monopolizing the resources. Finally, it encompasses safety considerations in two ways: first,
through capacity constraints; and second, by introducing a congestion-dependent term in (3) that
penalizes vertiports when the number of aircraft increases. With these three considerations, the
definition of social welfare aligns closely with that presented in (Dixit et al., 2023).
We assume the SP does not have access to the true valuations V, as it is private information.
Instead, the SP must use bids B reported by the FOs to allocate the aircraft to vertiports through
an auction mechanism – vertiport reservation mechanism. More formally, given a bid profile B,
the SP uses a mechanism M¯ = (x¯,(p¯) ), where for a given bid profile B, (i) x¯(B) ∈ X is the
i i∈F
allocation proposed by the mechanism; and (ii) p¯(B) ∈ R denotes the payment charged to FO
i
i ∈ F. Under the mechanism M¯, the utility derived by any FO i ∈ F is

3 Mechanism Design
We present an auction mechanism that satisfies (D1)-(D3) in Section 3.1, and prove its theoretical
properties in Section 3.2. Moreover, we present an approach for computing the auction mechanism
in Section 4.
3.1 Mechanism
Inspired by Myerson’s lemma (Myerson, 1981), our approach is to separate the allocation and pay-
ment functions so that the latter can ensure IC and IR as long as the former ensures maximization
of total welfare in terms of bids submitted.
Allocation Function: Given a bid profile B ∈ RL, the allocation is obtained by

x¯(B) ∈ argmax SW(x;B). (6)

Payment Function: We first define a function θ : F ×RL → RL such that for any i ∈ F,j ∈

Remark 3.1. The payment rule is inspired by the VCG mechanism, where each FO is charged a
10payment based on the externality created by them. Particularly, the typical VCG payment for any
player is determined by assessing the difference in the optimal social welfare of players when they
are present, versus when they are excluded from the auction environment.
Remark 3.2. There are some notable differences between the VCG payment and (8). First, since
our problem is an “exchange problem” and not the typical “assignment problem”, we need to be
cognizant of the physical resources occupied by the aircraft. However, this would require us to
enumerate all the feasible combinations if we were to directly implement VCG mechanisms. To
overcome the problem of enumerating all feasible solutions while computing payments, we adopt
a novel approach of “pseudo-bids”, where while computing the payments, each non-participating
aircraft is considered to be using a bid of 0, as formally described in (7).
Second, since the objective function (3) is not the summation of the participants’ valuations, the
typical VCG auction is not directly applicable. Instead, we follow (Dixit et al., 2023; Nisan et al.,
2007) to devise the payment rule for any i ∈ F and b ∈ RLi.

3.2 Theoretical Analysis
Theorem 3.3. The proposed mechanism M¯ = (x¯,p¯) is IC, IR, and SWM (i.e. satisfied (D1)-
(D3)).
Proof. Observe from (3) that SW(x;V) is a weighted summation of FOs’ valuations and the con-
gestion cost. Since the congestion cost is independent of valuations, x¯(V) ∈ argmax SW(x;V)
x∈X
is an affine maximizer with respect to FOs’ valuations, as defined in (Nisan et al., 2007, Definition
9.30). Thus, the allocation function (6) and the payment function (8) form a generalized VCG
mechanism, and IC directly follows from (Nisan et al., 2007, Proposition 9.31). Finally, IR follows
from (Nisan et al., 2007, Lemma 9.20) since the bids are non-negative, and the allocation is an
affine maximizer, as formally proved below.

4 Optimization Algorithm
In this section, we formulate (6) as a mixed binary linear program (MBLP), as shown in (16). We
derive this in three steps. First, in Section 4.1, we construct a time-extended flow network, where
vertices are vertiport-time and aircraft-time pairs with edges capturing capacity constraints and
route allocation. Then, using binary variables (δ as formally defined later in (12d) and (12e))
i,j,τ
to ensure that each aircraft is allocated one route, we formulate a mixed integer linear program
(MILP (12)) in Section 4.2. This MILP has fewer binary variables than (6) when the number of
unique departure times for any aircraft is less than the size of its menu. Finally, in Section 4.3, we
show that the total unimodularity of the constraint matrix (I¯ in (12b)) guarantees that all flows
⋆
12are integral for each binary variable assignment, so we can drop the integrality constraint (12f) and
get the final MBLP formulation (16).

Remark 4.1. In the preceding construction, the capacity of any outgoing edge (resp. incoming

4.2 Mixed Integer Linear Program Formulation
For the construction of auxiliary graph presented in Section 4.1, we concatenate the weight, upper
capacity bound, and lower capacity bound of each edge as W ∈ R|E¯|, C(δ) ∈ Z|E¯|, and C(δ) ∈ Z|E¯|,

respectively. Define an incidence matrix of the graph G¯ as I¯ ∈ {−1,0,1}|V¯|×|E¯|, where

Next, we highlight the connection between the optimization problems (6) and (12).
Proposition4.2. Suppose(A†,δ†)isanoptimalsolutionto (12). ThenW⊤ A† = max SW(x;B).
x∈X
Additionally, using A† we can uniquely determine x† ∈ X such that x† ∈ argmax SW(x;B).
x∈X
Proof. First,weshowthat,foreveryx ∈ X,thereexistsaunique(A(x),δ(x))satisfying(12b)-(12g)
and W⊤ A(x) = SW(x;B). Indeed, we construct (A(x),δ(x)) such that

is the q−th edge in E¯ ∪E¯ .
3,r,t 8,r
The above construction specifies the values of A (x) for e ∈ E¯ ∪E¯ ∪E¯ . Additionally, by Lemma
e 3 5 8
4.3, there exists a unique feasible solution (A(x),δ(x)) that satisfied (12b)-(12g) , and we get

Then, we examine each term. First, observe the following.

Using this, we conclude that

(A,δ) s.t. (12b)−(12g)
Next, we show that for every (A,δ) satisfying (12b)-(12g), there exists x(A,δ) ∈ X such that
SW(x(A,δ)) = W⊤ A. Indeed, we construct x(A,δ) such that for every i ∈ F,j ∈ A ,k ∈ m
i i,j
it holds that x = A for e ∈ E¯ such that (ν¯(i,j,tdep ),ν¯arr(rdest,tarr )) ∈ e or e ∈ E¯ such

that (ν¯(i,j,0),ν¯(rdest,1)) ∈ e. Note that due to capacity constraints on these edges, x ∈ {0,1}.
i,j,k i,j,k
Additionally, the flow balance at the nodes of the form ν¯(i,j,τ), for some i ∈ F,j ∈ A ,τ ∈ Tdep,

16ensures that

Summing over τ, we get

i,j,k
k∈mi,j
Using (12d), we conclude that P x (A,δ) = 1.
k∈mi,j i,j,k
Next, we use the flow balance at nodes of the form ν¯arr(r,t), for every r ∈ R,t ∈ [H], to ensure
that
X A 1((ν¯(i,j,tdep ),ν¯arr(rdest,tarr )) ∈ e,rdest = r,tarr = t) ≤ arr(r,t).
e i,j,k i,j,k i,j,k i,j,k i,j,k

By P A 1((ν¯(i,j,tdep ),ν¯arr(rdest,tarr )) ∈ e) = x (A,δ), we get

X X X x 1(rdest = r,tarr = t) ≤ arr(r,t)
i,j,k i,j,k i,j,k
i∈Fj∈Aik∈mi,j
Note that if t = 1, the arrival capacity constraints are trivially satisfied since there is no incoming
aircraft. Analogously, the flow balance equations at the nodes of the form ν¯dep(r,t), for some
r ∈ R,t ∈ [H], ensure that P P P x 1(rorig = r,tdep = t) ≤ dep(r,t). Finally, we
i∈F j∈Ai k∈mi,j i,j,k i,j i,j,k
can establish S(r,t,x(A,δ)) = Ppark(r,t) A through the flow balance equation at ν¯(r,t) and (1).
q=1 eq,r,t
Since Ppark(r,t) A ≤ park(r,t), due to the capacity constraints on the edge E¯ , it holds that
q=1 eq,r,t 3,r,t
S(r,t,x(A,δ)) ≤ park(r,t). Thus, we conclude that x(A,δ) ∈ X.
Additionally, using the analysis to show (13) in the backward direction and the construction of
17x(A,δ), we can establish that SW(x(A,δ)) = W⊤ A. Thus, we conclude that
W⊤ A† = max W⊤ A
(A,δ) s.t. (12b)−(12g)
(15)
= max SW(x(A,δ)) ≤ maxSW(x).
(A,δ) s.t. (12b)−(12g) x∈X
By (14) and (15), we get W⊤ A† = max SW(x).
x∈X
Next, we present a technical lemma used in the proof of Proposition 4.2.
¯ ¯ ¯
Lemma 4.3. Given the values of A for e ∈ E ∪ E ∪ E that satisfy the capacity constraints
e 3 5 8
(12c), there exists a unique feasible solution (A,δ) that satisfies (12b)-(12g).
Proof. First, notethatanyfeasiblesolutionto(12b)-(12g)hasthesamevalueofA (x)fore ∈ E¯ ∪
e 6
E¯ ∪E¯ since the lower and upper bound on capacity are the same on these edges by construction.

Thus, it is sufficient to show that the values of A for e ∈ E¯ ∪E¯ ∪E¯ ∪E¯ ∪E¯ ∪E¯ , uniquely
e 3 5 6 7 8 9
determine a feasible solution (A,δ) that satisfies (12b)-(12g). Particularly, we will show that we
can uniquely recover the values of A for e ∈ E¯ ∪E¯ ∪E¯ .
e 1 2 4
To show this claim, we leverage the flow balance constraint (12b) at every node. Below, we
state the incoming and outgoing edges from every type of node in the network.

184.3 Reduction to Mixed Binary Linear Program
Instead of solving (12), we can obtain (A†,δ†) by solving the following MBLP. We establish this
fact in Proposition 4.4.

A ∈
R|E¯|
. (16c)

Proposition 4.4. The optimal values of (12) and (16) are equal.
Proof. First, we prove that we can drop (12g) when solving (12). Suppose there exists r ∈ R,t ∈
[H], q ∈ [park(r,t)−1] such that A† < A† . By swapping the value of A† with that
q,r,t q+1,r,t q+1,r,t
of A† , we get a new feasible allocation with a weakly higher objective value. This is because
q,r,t
w¯ ≤ w¯ as λ ≥ 0 and C (·) is discrete convex.
q+1,r,t q,r,t r,t
Additionally, we can also relax (12f) to (16c) because, for any feasible value of δ, the opti-
mization problem (12) is an integer linear program where the constraint matrix I¯ satisfies total
⋆
unimodularity, so it is guaranteed to have an integral solution (Schrijver, 1998, Chapter 19).
For any fixed values of binary variables (δ ) , the optimization problem (12)
i,j,τ i∈F,j∈Ai,τ∈T id ,e jp
is in fact a maximum-weight flow problem. Thus, one can enumerate all the departure time
combinations, and solve each maximum-weight flow problem with the number of scenarios be-
ing Q |{tdep |k ∈ m }|. The complete problem can be solved efficiency using the above
i∈F,j∈Ai i,j,k i,j
MBLP approach, which will provide speed-up due to some techniques implemented in commercial
solvers such as branch and bound, cutting-plane methods, etc.
5 Discussions
We show how the proposed mechanism generalizes existing works in Section 5.1 and present some
extensions in Section 5.2.
5.1 Connections to Existing Mechanisms
Consider H = 1, arr(r,1) = ∞, dep(r,1) = ∞, ∀r ∈ R, and |A | = 1, ∀i ∈ F.
i
19(i) Air Traffic Protocol: When we treat each vertiport r ∈ R as a sector with park(r,1) being
the sector capacity, our model generalizes the problem studied in (Qin and Balakrishnan,
2022), where the authors did not consider arrival and departure capacities and assumed fleet
operators with single aircraft.
(ii) Airport Time Slot Auction: When we treat each vertiport r ∈ R as a time slot with
park(r,1) being the slot capacity, our model subsumes the framework in (Dixit et al., 2023).
Therefore, our formulation becomes a two-sided matching problem as detailed in (Dixit et al.,
2023) and is subject to a faster strongly polynomial-time algorithm.
5.2 Extensions of the Proposed Mechanism
Our framework can be easily extended to incorporate the following aspects.
(i) External Demand: Aircraft that are not available in the service area of the SP at t = 0
can be incorporated in our framework by setting rorig = O and tdep = 0,∀k ∈ m 8, where
i,j i,j,k i,j
O denotes an auxiliary vertiport denoting aircraft coming from outside of the service area of
SP.
(ii) EntireTrajectory: Wecanextendeachroutetoanentiretrajectorywithmultiplevertiport-
time pairs. By setting a binary variable for each route and combining those variables when
two routes only differ in one time slot, we can apply the same MBLP approach.
(iii) Cancellation Policy: It is possible to cancel or re-allocate some of the previously scheduled
flights due to changing vertiport capacities or newly emerging aircraft. While there is no
single criterion for re-allocation, it is typical to consider three aspects: congestion, efficiency,
and fairness, where we cancel flights from congested vertiports, with low valuations, or at
random, respectively.
6 Conclusion
In this work, we propose an auction mechanism to incentivize fleet operators to report their val-
uations truthfully and consequently perform a socially optimal vertiport reservation. This ap-
proach adapts the popular Vickrey–Clarke–Groves mechanism while considering the egalitarian,
8In this case, rorig and tdep do not affect our analysis, so we can set them arbitrarily.

20congestion-aware, and computational issues. The proposed framework could be of interest beyond
air traffic management, such as multi-robot coordination. In a follow-up paper, we shall provide
a numerical analysis of the mechanism’s performance. Several interesting avenues exist for future
research. First, we would like to extend the auction mechanism to include waypoints in airspace,
thus moving toward a more complete air traffic flow management formulation. Second, different
fairness notions have been considered in airspace and other areas, such as reversals, takeovers,
and priority guarantees (Bertsimas and Gupta, 2016; Su et al., 2023). It is interesting to compare
different formulations, both theoretically and empirically.
