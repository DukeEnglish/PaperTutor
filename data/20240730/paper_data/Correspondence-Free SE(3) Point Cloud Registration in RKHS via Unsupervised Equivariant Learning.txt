Abstract. This paper introduces a robust unsupervised SE(3) point
cloud registration method that operates without requiring point corre-
spondences. The method frames point clouds as functions in a repro-
ducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), leveraging SE(3)-equivariant fea-
tures for direct feature space registration. A novel RKHS distance met-
ric is proposed, offering reliable performance amidst noise, outliers, and
asymmetrical data. An unsupervised training approach is introduced to
effectively handle limited ground truth data, facilitating adaptation to

1 Introduction
Point cloud registration estimates the relative transformation between two sets
of3Dspatialobservations[3,9,34,61,64].Itiscommonlyformulatedasanonlin-
ear optimization problem, with data inputs from varied sensors such as RGB-D
cameras, stereo cameras, and LiDAR. This technique is vital in computer vi-
sion and robotics, especially for applications like visual odometry [29] and 3D
reconstruction [56]. Despite its wide use, point cloud registration encounters
numerous challenges. These include complexities in nonlinear optimization on
Riemannianmanifolds,addressingnon-overlappingobservations,andmitigating
the impact of sensor noise and outliers [42,58]. These challenges stem from two
tightly coupled components in traditional point cloud registration: point repre-
sentationsandcorrespondences.Pointrepresentationreferstotheactualformat
of the point data in the process. Given a representation, point correspondences
are related to the construction of the residuals from point pairings.

Classical methods represent points using hand-crafted geometric primitives
such as 3D point coordinates [3,47], planes [9], Gaussian mixtures [28,34], and
surfels [8,56]. These representations, typically as low-dimensional vectors, al-
low residuals to be computed directly as Euclidean or Mahalanobis distances.
However, they often struggle with handling noisy and outlier-rich observations
becausetheyrelyonstrictdatacorrespondence.Correctdataassociationischal-
lenging [30], especially when the features are not discriminative enough. Robust
optimization strategies are often needed to minimize these limitations [58].
In contrast, Continuous Visual Odometry (CVO) [13,24,61] introduces a
robust registration framework that represents each point cloud as a continuous
functioninRKHS.Itsiterativeregistrationprocessminimizesthedistanceofthe
twopointcloudfunctionsinRKHSanddoesn’trequirestrictpair-wisepointcor-
respondences. Although it demonstrates superior robustness compared to clas-
sical geometric registration methods, the iterative framework is constrained by
limited expressiveness because the framework is not differentiable.
Advancements in deep neural networks bring differentiable point set regis-
tration by learning point representations that embody geometric invariance [10,
19,31,41,54,60] or equivariance. Invariant-feature-based approaches focus on
learning point-wise local and global features that remain invariant under pose
transformations, leading to semantic-aware data association [27,59]. Once one-
to-onecorrespondencesareestablished,methodslikeRANSACorweightedSVD
areemployedforposeregression[3,22].However,challengespersistinthegener-
alization of invariant learning. During training, excessive data augmentation is
required for sampling transformations in SE(3) and simulating the noise pertur-
bations. Besides, their supervised nature rely on extensive ground truth labels.EquivAlign: Corr.-Free Point Cloud Reg. via Unsupervised Equiv. Learning 3
Equivariant-feature-based methods provide an alternative deep representa-
tion for point clouds [15,17,50,55]. Equivariance is a property for a map such
that given a transformation in the input, the output changes in a predictable
way determined by the input transformation: A function f :X →Y is equivari-
ant to a set of transformations G, if for any g ∈G, g f(x)=f(g x),∀x∈X .

Recent strides in equivariant learning have expanded to include SO(3) [18,65],
SE(3)[7,64],andE(n)[45]equivariantnetworks.Comparedtoinvariantfeature-
based methods, these networks relax the need for extensive data augmentation
and thereby leading to improved generalization [64]. While equivariant learning
has shown promise within physics and chemistry, its effectiveness in real-world
robotic tasks like point cloud registration is not well-established. For existing
works,commonpracticesincludetrainingashapeembeddingtore-establishthe
one-to-one correspondence [65], or pooling point-wise equivariant features into
global equivariance features [7,64]. These approaches undermine the complexi-
ties of the noisy and outlier-rich real data where the two input point clouds are
not exactly the same, i.e., the equivariance does not fully hold.
In this work, we introduce an unsupervised feature space registration frame-
work, EquivAlign, as depicted in Figure 2. This framework focuses on learning
point-wise representations that respect the intricate geometric structure in fea-
turespace.Theproposedequivariantkernellearninginterpretstheneuralfeature
embeddings of these point clouds as nonparametric functions within a specified
RKHS. This unique perspective allows for feature space registration without
strict correspondences, further supporting the fully differentiable and unsuper-
vised nature of our proposed method. The contributions are outlined as follows:
1. AniterativeandfullydifferentiableSE(3)registrationframeworkthatfacili-
tates correspondence-free feature space pose regression, enabling robustness
to unseen noise and outliers.
2. Alightweightfeaturerepresentationequivariantto3Drotationsandtransla-
tions via a novel direct sum construction. This construction is modular and
can easily benefit from future advances in equivariant encoders.
3. An unsupervised inner-outer loop training scheme for equivariant feature
learning, incorporating a curriculum learning schedule, demonstrates en-
hanced accuracy compared to classical and supervised baselines and shows
effectiveness in real-world applications.

2.4 Nonparametric Registration in RKHS
Continuous Visual Odometry (CVO) [25] introduces a novel point cloud regis-
trationformulationbyrepresentingcoloredpointcloudsascontinuousfunctions
in an RKHS and aligns these functions using gradient ascent. The optimization
step size is estimated through a fourth-order Taylor expansion. Kernel corre-
lation [51], a specific instance of CVO, focuses solely on geometric registration
and optimizes the loss using a first-order approximation. AdaptiveCVO [32] op-
timizes the kernel length scale, while SemanticCVO [61] integrates hierarchical
semantic information, such as color and semantics, with geometric data.
EquivAlign sets itself apart from the above methods by reformulating the
approachtoensuredifferentiability,thusenablingthelearningoffeaturesmetic-
ulously designed for the registration task. Such features are required to support

it employs them in a non-differentiable fashion, depending on features derived
from a pretrained network.
3 Problem Formulation
Before delving into the proposed EquivAlign in the following section, we briefly
review the notations and core principles of the problem.
Consider two (finite) collections of points, X = {x ,...,x } ⊂ R3, Z =

The group action SE(3)↷R3 induces an action on the RKHS, SE(3)↷H, de-
noted as h.f(x) := f(hx). Inspired by this observation, we set h.f := f .

Furthermore, each point might contain pose-invariant information in different
dimensions, such as color or intensity, described by a point in an inner product
space, (I,⟨·,·⟩ ). To represent pose-invariant information, we introduce two la-

beling functions, l : X → I and l : Z → I for the two point clouds with
X Z
l (hx) = l (x),l (hz) = l (z), respectively. With the kernel formulation [5],

the point cloud functions are

To measure the alignment of the two point clouds given an isometry trans-
formation h∈SE(3) that preserves norms, we can use the distance between the
two point cloud functions [13]

X hZ X hZ H X X H Z Z H X hZ H
The distance is well-defined because RKHS is endowed with a valid inner
product. With the reproducing property [2], each inner product becomes

4 EquivAlign Framework
Figure 2 illustrates the EquivAlign framework. The process begins with the in-
troduction of a lightweight SE(3) equivariant feature representation as detailed
in Section 4.1. Subsequently, we focus on optimizing the pose and kernel pa-
rameters within this feature space (Sections 4.2 and 4.3). The training phase
is distinctive due to the disparate stages and frequencies at which updates for
the equivariant feature encoder, as well as for the kernel and pose, take place.
To address this, we perform an unsupervised inner-outer loop learning strategy
with curriculum learning, as discussed in Section 4.5.
4.1 Equivariant Point Representation
Unlike raw 3D coordinates, feature maps extracted from deep neural networks
produce a more expressive representation of the point clouds. Instead of repre-
sentingeachpointasanelementinR3 asinCVO,wedesignequivariantfeatures
torepresentthem,x⊕˜f:adirectsumofx’scoordinateandmultiplechannelsof
3-dimensional steerable vectors˜f :=ϕ(x), with ϕ being the equivariant encoder
with weights θ. The steerable features are a specific type-1 feature [50] for rota-
tions in VectorNeuron [18]. VectorNeuron proposes that SE(3)-equivariance can
be realized by centering the point cloud coordinates. However, in real applica-
tions, the two input point clouds do not fully overlap. Thus, we cannot simply
centralize them and process the rotation-only registration. Instead, we incorpo-
rateanadditionaltype-0feature—the3Dcoordinateitself.Eachchannelofthis
representation can be visualized as a vector field defined on R3, as shown in
Figure 3. This straightforward yet effective representation is modular, allowing
for easy adaptation to future advancements in equivariant encoders.
The rotation R and translation t of the pose h can be applied directly to the
point-wise feature representations as follows:
R(x⊕˜f)=Rx⊕R˜f, t(x⊕˜f)=(t+x)⊕˜f. (4)

complex with higher-dimensional inputs, such as the direct sum of the 3D coor-
dinate and the multi-channel steerable vectors. Secondly, the kernel’s hyperpa-
rametersshouldbeinterpretable,enablinganunderstandingofitsimpactonthe
model’s performance. The kernel is defined as the product of the Radial Basis

ℓ i i j j ℓ i j i j
The RBF kernel is utilized for the coordinate part and the hyperbolic tangent
kernel for the steerable feature maps. The RBF kernel includes a kernel param-
eter, the lengthscale ℓ, which is optimized during pose inference:

The RBF kernel is adopted to leverage the lengthscale parameter in promoting
sparsity and minimizing the number of non-trivial terms in the loss calculation.

4.4 Inference
During the inference stage, the goal is to minimize the distance between two
functions with respect to the pose h and the kernel parameter ℓ, while keeping
the encoder weights θ fixed:
hˆ,ℓˆ=argmind(f ,f ). (11)
ϕ(X) hϕ(Z)
h,ℓ
It’s important to note that for each iteration of pose optimization, there’s no
need to process the transformed point cloud through the encoder again. In-
stead, the approach involves directly transforming the equivariant features and
re-evaluating the kernels during the loss calculation.
4.5 Unsupervised Training of Equivariant Encoder
In practical scenarios such as visual odometry, ground truth transformation la-
bels are often scarce. To adapt the encoder weights to new environments, unsu-
pervised bi-level training [40] is employed:
Inner Loop:argmind(f ,f ),Outer Loop:argmind(f ,f ).
ϕ(X) hϕ(Z) ϕ(X) hˆϕ(Z)
h,ℓ θ
(12)
Duringtraining,thetwopointcloudsX,Z areinitiallyprocessedthroughthe
equivariant encoder ϕ to derive the point-wise equivariant features ϕ(X),ϕ(Z).
Subsequently, in each iteration, the loss is minimized with respect to the trans-
formation h and the kernel parameter ℓ, facilitating a stepwise update of the
transformation. Using the latest pose estimate hˆ, the gradient is retained in
the computation graph, and the encoder parameters are updated. This training
strategy does not require ground truth pose labels.
Additional aspects of the training procedure are necessary to ensure satis-
factory convergence properties. A curriculum training strategy is employed to
initiate training from random initial weights, starting with smaller angles at 1◦
and progressively advancing to larger angles up to 90◦. Moreover, there is a
tendency for the kernel parameter to change too rapidly, potentially causing its
values effectively becoming zero. To mitigate this issue, a learning rate that is
100 times smaller is utilized specifically for updating the kernel lengthscale ℓ.

pared to equivariant-learning-based approaches. EquivAlign demonstrates per-
formanceonparwithclassicalICPmethodsandsuperiortoE2PN.However,at
initial angles of 90◦, ICP and GICP show larger errors due to their reliance on
accurate initial guesses for data association. In these scenarios, EquivAlign sur-
passes E2PN, but invariant feature-matching methods achieve the best results.
When encountering Gaussian noise, EquivAlign reaches a slightly better ac-
curacy than the invariant feature matching methods at 45◦ (except GeoTrans-
former) and is the best-performing method at 90◦. GeoTransformer tops the
benchmark at 45◦. Similar to the noise-less situation, non-learning methods’
result degenerate at larger initial angles.
With 20% uniformly distributed outliers, methods assuming Gaussian errors
will degrade. Invariant feature matching is severely affected by this type of per-
turbation and fails to register at smaller or larger angles, unless extensive data
augmentationisusedduringtraining.ICP-basedmethodscanreachsatisfactory

expressiveness of equivariant features helps in the robustness of the registration
process, even when only noise-free data is used in training.
In tests involving random cropping of input data (with no cropping in train-
ing),asreportedinTable1(Bottom),allmethodsexperienceperformancedips.12 R. Zhang et al.
Similar to the third case, ICP-based methods are not substantially affected by
the cropping at 45◦ but are easily trapped in the local minima at larger an-
gles. Classical invariant feature-based baselines cannot converge at either ini-
tial angle, but with sufficient data augmentation, GeoTransformer becomes the
best-performing method. Both equivariant methods also experienced larger er-
rors, not as severe as the classical invariant feature matching methods though.
The proposed learning-based RKHS formulation natively annihilates the outlier
disturbance because, at larger distances, the kernel will return trivial values. In
contrast, as E2PN directly performs global pooling over all the points to obtain
a single global feature, missing cropped components will reduce the quality of
the global feature, especially when the crop is unseen in the training data.
5.2 Real Dataset: ETH3D RGB-D Registration
Setup: In this experiment, EquivAlign is benchmarked against other baselines
using a real RGB-D dataset. We utilize the ETH3D dataset [46], comprising
real indoor and outdoor RGB-D images. In this setup, two point cloud pairs are
sampled sequentially. Unlike the simulated ModelNet40 dataset, a pair of point
clouds will not fully overlap even without noise injections due to the viewpoint
change. Additionally, the ground truth pose will contain rotation and transla-
tion but at smaller angles than the ModelNet40 experiment. A random rotation
perturbation of 10◦ is injected into each pair of testing data. 6 sequences are
used for training: (cable_3, ceiling_1, repetitive, einstein_2, sfm_house
_loop, desk_3), 2 sequences for validation: (mannequin_3, sfm_garden), and 4
sequences for testing: (sfm_lab_room_1, plant_1, sfm_bench, table_3). Given
the varying number of frames in each sequence, frame pairs are subsampled to
ensure no more than 1000 pairs per sequence. This results in 5919 training in-
stances, 2000 validation instances, and 2702 test instances. For all the methods,
input point clouds are downsampled into 1024 points with the farthest_point
_down_sample method from Open3D [63]. For a fair comparison, color informa-
tion is excluded in EquivAlign by setting the label function l (x)=1 in Eq. (2)
X
as the baselines similarly abstain from using color.
Results: The quantitative results are shown in Table 2. On the test se-
quences,EquivAlign demonstratesthebestaccuracyinbothrotationandtrans-
lationevaluations,witha0.53◦ rotationerror,0.01mtranslationerror,andlow-
estvariations.Theinvariantfeature-basedbaselineshavesignificantlylargertest
errors.Thisisduetothechallengeofgeneralizingtoreal-worldnoise,particularly
for supervised learning methods. ICP-based methods have comparable transla-
tion errors, but their rotation error is 60% and 25% larger, respectively. This
comparison indicates that EquivAlign produces fine-grained registration alone
in real data and thus can be adopted in applications like frame-to-frame pose
tracking. It does not have the necessity of using coarse-to-fine strategies with
ICP, as adopted in recent invariant-learning-based works like PREDATOR [27].
Moreover, the other equivariant baseline, E2PN, is also not as accurate as

uses a finite group rotation representation on equivariance learning, resulting in
amuchfasterrunningspeedviafeaturepermutation.However,thediscretization
comes at a cost; that is, it will have resolution challenges at fine-grained regis-
tration,especiallycomparedtoEquivAlign’scontinuousrotationrepresentation.
Secondly, EquivAlign does not require training labels and thus is not tightly
coupledtothetrainingdatadistribution.Incontrast,E2PNneedsgroundtruth
supervision, which means there would be overfitting challenges if the test set is
a new scene. Thirdly, EquivAlign adopts the RKHS representation whose ker-
nel can eliminate the influence of non-overlapped areas, while E2PN assumes
complete symmetry of the input pair, which is often violated in real data. Re-
cent works such as SE3-Transformer [23] and GeoTransformer [42] attempt to
bring the attention mechanism to address this issue. But training the attention
network will also need ground truth labels.
5.3 Ablation Study
Kernel Choice The chosen kernel, although not our primary focus, prefers
minimal hyperparameters and is interpretable, or any suitable kernel satisfying
these. Even with a 3D kernel in the classical CVO [61], the hyperparameters
significantlyimpacttheresults.Morecomplexityincontrollingthemcouldarise
with higher dimensional inputs like the higher dimensional steerable vectors.
The current kernel choice links RBF kernel lengthscales to Euclidean point dis-
tances, whereas the tanh kernel only considers steerable vector directions. To
demonstrate that, we train and test the network with a single RBF kernel on
ModelNet40 of 45◦ initial angles in Table 3 (a).
InitialKernelParameter EquivAlignhasahyperparameter,thekernellength-
scale ℓ, which controls the coarse-grain and fine-grain resolution of the loss [13,
61]. It is optimized during pose regression but still requires an initial value. In
this ablation study shown in Table 3 (b), we test how the initial lengthscale will
affect the registration accuracy on the ModelNet40 dataset. The outcome cor-
roboratesinsightsfromtheCVOworks:Registeringatlargeranglesnecessitates
a greater initial lengthscale for a comprehensive global perspective.14 R. Zhang et al.

lengthscales across two initial angles reveals a direct relationship between problem
scale and lengthscale, suggesting larger initial errors require larger lengthscales. (c)
Necessity of Curriculum Learning: Starting with small, incremental angles on
the ModelNet40 dataset yields lower error means and STDs than starting from larger
angles, underscoring curriculum learning’s efficacy in training.
Curriculum Learning vs. Direct Training As an unsupervised approach,
onesignificantchallengeweaddressedwasthebootstrapoftherandomly-initialized

tweencurriculum-basedtraininganddirecttrainingatmaximalangularpertur-
bations,aspresentedinTable3(c).Ourfindingsshowthatagradualcurriculum
with incremental steps significantly enhances model accuracy and reduces un-
certainty, highlighting the effectiveness of curriculum learning for optimizing
network performance from randomly initialized weights.
6 Limitations and Conclusion
There are trade-offs with our method, including lengthy training times and re-
duced performance with limited overlap. Our unsupervised training approach
uses a curriculum learning strategy that progresses from smaller to larger rota-
tions, resulting in extended training times. Training on the ModelNet40 dataset
with 8 NVIDIA V100 GPUs takes a week for 90◦ registrations. Performance de-
creasesinlow-overlapscenarios,asindicatedinTable1,where60%overlap(20%
cropping) reduces registration accuracy. However, data augmentation, longer
training cycles, and a denser curriculum can improve low-overlap performance,
whileasparsercurriculumcanreducetrainingtime.Besidestheextendedtrain-
ingtime,ourmethodhasaninferencetimeof0.03to0.1secondsperiterationon

transformers into the encoder to capture more extended feature correlations,
enhancing robustness and efficiency.
In summary, this paper introduces a differentiable, iterative point cloud reg-
istrationframeworkthatleveragescorrespondence-freeposeregressioninRKHS.
EquivAlign achieves fine-grained feature space registration and effectively han-

datasets show our method outperforming established methods particularly in
noise resilience. This study lays a foundation for further research in unsuper-
vised equivariant learning within 3D vision and opens its application to numer-
ous fields, including but not limited to robotics and the medical domain.EquivAlign: Corr.-Free Point Cloud Reg. via Unsupervised Equiv. Learning 15
