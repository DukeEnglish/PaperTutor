Introduction
Social behaviors often spread by imitation, as individuals tend to imitate others they perceive as more
successful. Traditional models of behavioral imitation, or social learning, assume a simple contagion process:
an individual will consider imitating a more successful neighbor following a single social interaction [1–8].
However,real-worldcontagionprocessesarealsoknowntooftenbecomplex,meaningthatanindividualmay
requiremultipleexposurestoanalternativetypebeforetheyconsiderchangingtheirowntype[9,10]. Ideally,
a realistic model of behavioral evolution in a population would incorporate both the (rational) tendency to
imitate more successful neighbors, as well as the (irrational) tendency towards herd behavior or conformity
regardless of payofsf to the individual.
Complex contagion is already well developed in the context of neutral traits that spread through a
population – notably opinions or beliefs [11–17] – when there is no intrinsic benefit of assuming one type
or another. And yet there are many real-world situations where social behaviors with frequency-dependent
payoffs, such as cooperation [18, 19] or adoption of online services with network externalities [20–22], also
spread through social contagion. And so it is natural to postulate that both herd mentality, embodied in
complexcontagion,aswellaspayoff-biasedsociallearning,capturedbyimitationdynamics,collectivelydrive
behavioral evolution.
Of particular interest is the interplay between these two qualitatively different aspects of behavioral
change–becausetheneedformultipleexposuresmayarisefromconsiderationsoutsideofthedirectmaterial
payoff of the behavior itself, such as credibility, legitimacy, and emotion [11]. Although theoretical studies of
complex contagion have focused on complex contagions on different network structures [10], the question of
how complex contagion modifies payoff-biased imitation has received little attention.
Here, we propose a mathematical model that combines the dynamics of complex contagion with those of
payoff-biased imitation. In this model, individuals interact with a subset of their peers in the population,

different internal stable equilibria. We conclude by discussing the relevance of these results, and our math-
ematical formulation, for more realistic models of social learning that combine both rational, payoff-biased
updates along with features of conformity or anti-conformity biases [25–30].
Model
We introduce payoff-biased imitation into a model of a neutral complex contagion. [17] defined complex
contagion in a structured population, where each individual i = 1,2,···N is represented by a vertex on a
network. The population consists of two types X,Y, and individuals change their type based on a (neutral)
complex contagion among neighbors. Specifically, at each time step, a randomly chosen focal individual i
switches its type with some probability. If the focal individual is of type X, it switches to type Y with
probability
pX→Y =yγ
i i
where y is the proportion of neighbors of i of type Y; otherwise individual i retains his type. If the focal
i
individual is of type Y, the probability of switching to type X is symmetrically defined as pY→X = xγ.
i i
Although [17] considered a more general situation where γ differs between pX→Y and pY→X, we fix γ to be
i i
identical for both directions, and we focus instead on asymmetries in switching probabilities that arise from
payoff differences between types, which will in general depend on their frequencies in the population.
The stochastic update rule above can be interpreted mechanistically as follows: individual i has some
threshold, M, that compels them to switch types. Individual i will switch if and only if there are M or
more neighbors of the other type in their neighborhood. The threshold M is drawn independently by each
individual from an identical probability distribution d(M)∝Mγ−1 [17]. With a normalizing constant γ, we
obtain the desired switching probability. For example, when i is of type X,
pX→Y =P(y ≥M|y )
i i i
(cid:90) yi
= γMγ−1dM
0
=yγ.
i
For γ = 1, any value of threshold M ∈ [0,1] is drawn with equal chance, so that the switching probability
equals the frequency of the opposite type in an individual’s neighborhood. This corresponds to a simple
contagion. A value γ > 1 means that an individual is more likely to have a high threshold for switching
types, whereas γ <1 means a lower threshold is more likely. This model of complex contagion describes the
spread of neutral markers X and Y, in the sense that an individual’s type does not influence fitness or bias

[11–17].

engage in pairwise social interactions. In our setting, an individual’s type represents a strategy for social
interaction, and individuals acquire payoffs that depend on their own strategy and the strategies of others
they interact with. We seek to generalize the model of contagion above so that it is biased by payoffs –
meaningthatindividualstendtocopystrategiesthataremoresuccessful–whileretainingthethreshold-like
behavior of a complex contagion [11, 31–33]. To develop this combined model, we stipulate that in each
discrete time period, each individual plays a pairwise game with n other individuals, randomly selected from
the population (and possibly including self-play). At the end of each time period, one individual i is selected
toconsiderupdatingtheirstrategy. Letn bethenumbertype-X individualsthefocalindividualiinteracted

Y X Y
individual i of type X will then switch to strategy Y with probability ρX→Y (and likewise focal individual
of type Y will switch to type X with probability ρY→X) defined by the following expression:
(cid:26) 1 if n /n≥M (cid:26) 1 if n /n≥M
ρX→Y = 1+exp(sD) Y ρY→X = 1+exp(−sD) X (1)
0 otherwise 0 otherwise
where D ≜ f (n )−f (n ) is the difference in total payoffs to individuals of types X and Y in that

time period. The fitness of each type is the empirical payoff perceived by the focal individual i: f (n ) =
X X
[n π(X,X) + n π(X,Y)]/n,f (n ) = [n π(Y,X)+n π(Y,Y)]/n where π(X,Y) denotes the payoff a
X Y Y X X Y
type-X individual playing the pairwise game with an opponent of type Y, and so on.
Note that this definition of the switching probability (Eq. 1) involves a Fermi function of the payoff
difference between individuals, which is a standard formulation for payoff-biased imitation dynamics [6, 23,
34]. The parameter s denotes the strength of selection [35], and it quantifies how much payoffs matter at
all when individuals consider switching types. At the same time, the switching probability in Eq. 1 also
involves a threshold frequency M, characteristic of complex contagion. And this model is a combination of
payoff-biased imitation along with complex contagion.
Results
1 Continuous limit
Wewillanalyzethismodelofsociallearningwithcomplexcontagionbystudyingitscontinuumlimit,derived
for large populations. In doing so, we focus on well-mixed population for which analytical expression of the
dynamics can be derived. Specifically, as both N and n becomes large, the dynamics can be approximated
by the following ODE (see Methods for derivation).
x˙
=x(1−x)(cid:0) xγ−1(1+αD)−(1−x)γ−1(1−αD)(cid:1)
(2)
where x denotes the frequency of strategy X (as opposed to Y) in the population, and α ≜ s/2 reflects the
strength of selection.
This model provides a sound basis for studying complex contagion of strategic behaviors with payoff-
biased imitation in large populations. On the one hand, when γ = 1, Eq. 2 reduces to the standard
replicator equation for strategy dynamics under simple contagion. On the other hand, in the absence of
selection, α=0, this model reduces to the standard model of complex contagion for neutral types. All other
regimes — that is, the complex contagion of behavioral strategies that affect fitness and imitation — remain
unexplored.
We note in passing that there is an alternative construction of this model from a discrete stochastic
process that also gives rise to these replicator dynamics in two-strategy settings (see Methods).

Forlineargames,wherethepayoffdifferenceDcanbewrittenasalinearfunctionofthestrategyfrequency

for several different choices of γ and α (see Methods for details). Specifically, if α=0 (e.g. Donation game),
thereisatmostoneinternalfixedpointregardlessofthesignofγ is. Whenα>0(e.g. Coordinationgame),
there is at most one internal fixed point if γ > 1. When α < 0, there is at most one internal fixed point if
γ <1.
The stability at fixed points are determined by the sign of D¯ (see Methods). Specifically, x = 0 is an
asymptotically stable steady state if lim D¯ < 0; and x = 1 is an asymptotically stable steady state if
x→0
lim D¯ >0. Furthermore, since that the prefactor x(1−x) in the continuous dynamics is strictly positive
x→1
and bounded in the interior, there is a stable (unstable) equilibrium whenever D¯ downcrosses (upcrosses)
x-axisintheinterior. Thisallowsustoanalyzetheequilibriaandtheirstabilitypropertiesbysimplyplotting

3 The dynamics of linear games
The framework above allows us to characterize the long-term outcome of payoff-biased complex contagion of
behavioral strategies, for any choice of contagion parameter γ and any 2×2 symmetic game matrix (cid:18)RS(cid:19).
TP
The following examples show that complex contagion can lead to qualitatively different outcomes for which
behaviors dominate, compared to the standard model of simple payoff-biased imitation. For example, the
Prisoner’s Dilemma always leads to a population of pure defectors for simple contagion of behaviors; but
under complex contagion with γ < 1 the population can evolve to a stable mixture of cooperators and
defectors. We will also analyze Snowdrift and Coordination games.
Figure 1 plots the difference in payoffs of the two strategies D¯ as a function of the frequency x of one
strategy. These plots graphically depict the possible dynamical outcomes for the Donation game, Snowdrift
game, and Coordination game. An internal equilibrium exists when D¯ intersects the x-axis, which is stable
(unstable) if it is down-crossing (up-crossing). The equilibrium at x = 0 (x = 1) is stable if D¯ is negative
(positive) at that point.
We see that γ <1, which is a form of anti-conformity bias, tends to create a stable internal equilibrium,
because this type of contagion permits even the lower-payoff strategy to spread. Conversely, conformity bias
γ > 1 tends to create equilibria at endpoints, because this contagion process makes individuals more likely
to cluster on one strategy or the other. The effects of the contagion process in both cases, however, are
also moderated by the dynamics arising payoffs, to a degree that depends on the strength of selection α in
payoff-biased imitation.
The payoff matrices for each of these three games and corresponding internal equilibria, for values of
parameter γ that permit closed-form analytical solutions, are detailed below. A comprehensive analysis of
the dynamics of these games under different parameter regimes is shown in Table 1, and a more general
treatment of linear games can be found in Methods.
Donation Game The Donation game is a minim al model a Prisoner’s Dilemma with payoff matrix as
follows:

where b > c > 0. For γ = 1/2 and γ = 2, we can explicitly solve for the unique internal equilibrium

Figure 1: Complex contagion can qualitatively change outcomes of behavioral evolution. We plot payoff
difference D¯ as a function of the frequency x of strategy 1, for three different games. A stable internal equilibrium,
where both strategies co-exist, occurs when D¯ intersects the x-axis with negative slope. The equilibrium at x = 0
(x = 1) is stable if D¯ is negative (positive) at that boundary. Under simple contagion (γ = 1), the only stable
outcomes are pure defection in the Prisoner’s Dilemma, a mixture of both strategies in the Snowdrift game, and
pure coordination in the Coordination game. But complex contagion (γ >1 or γ <1) leads to qualitatively different
outcomes,including,e.g.,astablemixtureofcooperatorsanddefectorsinaPrisoner’sdilemma. Parameters: α=0.15,

4 Monte Carlo simulations of the stochastic process
We present simulations of our discrete time/state stochastic process to compare its behavior to the ODE
derived in the infinite-population limit. We set the population size N = 2,500, neighborhood size n = 500,
and we ran Monte Carlo simulations for 106 time steps with different initial strategic frequencies. The
simulation results show good agreement with the behavior of the continuum ODE approximation.1
Table 2 shows the strategic frequencies at the quasi-stationary state, which were computed by running
simulations for 106 generations and taking the average of the frequencies over the last 105 generations.

When γ = 1 (simple contagion) the replicator dynamics are already well understood, and they exhibit
a cyclic pattern. For γ > 1, however, the dynamics gravitate towards the three pure strategy states, each

all three strategies present in the population (Figure 2). We also use this ODE to derive results for a
three-strategy version of the Prisoner’s Dilemma game (see Supplementary Material), where again complex
contagion qualitatively change the dynamical outcomes.

7Discussion
This study takes afirst step towards integrating complex contagions with payoff-biased imitation to describe
the dynamics of social traits in a population. We have developed a framework that incorporates elements
of both of these processes simultaneously, which extends the literature on payoff-biased simple contagions
[1–3, 5–8, 36, 37] as well as the literature on complex contagions for neutral traits [11, 15–17]. The resulting
synthetic framework offers a way to study realistic situations where behavioral change is driven in part by
aspects of conformity or anti-conformity biases [25–30] and in part by imitation of more successful types [1,
2, 5–8, 37–39]. While this framework can be seen as a generalization of both payoff-biased imitation and
complexcontagiondynamics,itisparticularlysuitedfordescribingscenarioswherebothelementsarepresent
[18–22].
Our analysis reveals that the complexity of the contagion process can qualitatively change the long-term
behavioral outcomes in a population undergoing social learning – e.g., changing the eventual dominance of
one type into either a stable mixture of two types, or alternatively producing bistability where either one or
the other type would have eventually dominated a population.
Our modelling framework is developed as a discrete time and state stochastic process that prescribes
whenoneindividualwillimitateanother’stype. Takingthelimitasthepopulationsizegetslargewederived
a replicator-like ODE, which seamlessly connects standard complex contagions of neutral types [17] and
the standard replicator equation for strategy evolution[1]. The resulting ODE, whose behavior matches the
quasi-stationarybehaviorofstochasticsimulationsinafinitepopulation, providesausefultoolforanalyzing
the dynamics of strategies for linear pairwise games, with two or more strategies. Furthermore, it offers a
novel interpretation of the standard replicator equation: it describes a dynamic that arise when individuals
engage in payoff-biased imitation only if the frequency of an alternative strategy is beyond certain threshold
that is drawn from a uniform distribution (γ =1).
The introduction of complexity in the contagion processes (γ ̸= 1) significantly alters the classical equi-
libria for various evolutionary games. In the Prisoner’s Dilemma, complexity can shift the system from a
monomorphic stable state to either an interior equilibrium or a bistable state. The Snowdrift game, under
complex contagion, transitions from a unique stable interior equilibrium to exhibiting bistability. Lastly, the
Coordination game can shift from its usual bistable nature to having two internal stable equilibria. The
parameters γ, which governs the power-law distribution from which the threshold for considering alterna-
tive strategies is drawn, and the parameter α, which determines the strength of payoff-biased imitation,
collectively determine the long-term evolutionary outcomes.
Our study sheds light on the interplay between complex contagion and payoff-biased imitation. Our
work is certainly not without limitations. First, we have focused on the case where the population is well-
mixed. Future work could extend our analysis to structured populations, either to meta-populations or
to populations with explicit network structure for pairwise social interactions. Also, we have considered
independent and identical power-law distribution for the threshold M and we focused our analysis on linear
frequency-dependentgames. Differentthresholddistributions,perhapsdependentonanindividual’sstrategy
or even their position within a social network, as well as application to non-linear games are all avenues for
future research.

At the boundaries of the state space, for bounded D, we have
dx˙

x→0dx x→0
dx˙
lim = limγ(1−x)γ−1(1−αD)−(1+αD).
x→1dx x→1
Thus, if γ <1, x=0 is stable if lim (1+αD)<0 and x=1 is stable if lim (1−αD)<0. If γ >1,
x→0 x→0
x = 0 is stable if lim −(1−αD) < 0 and x = 1 is stable if lim −(1+αD) < 0. Notice that this is
x→1 x→1
equivalent to checking the sign of D¯ at each endpoint. Specifically, if D is bounded on x∈[0,1] and γ <1,
then
limD¯ = limxγ−1(1+αD)−(1−αD)
x→0 x→0
limD¯ = lim(1+αD)−(1−x)γ−1(1−αD)
x→1 x→1
which implies that

On the other hand, if γ >1,
limD¯ =−(1−αD)
x→0
limD¯ =1+αD
x→1
which implies that
(cid:18) dx˙(cid:19) (cid:16) (cid:17)

(cid:18) dx˙(cid:19) (cid:16) (cid:17)
sign lim =sign limD¯ =sign(1+αD| ).
x→1dx x→1 x=1
Note that, even though the expression for dx˙/dx can be complicated, especially for internal fixed points,
by continuity of D¯ we know that there is at least one unstable fixed point in (0,1) (because D¯ is up-crossing
the x-axis) when the fixed points at both ends are are stable; and there is at least one stable fixed point in
(0,1) (because D¯ is down-crossing the x-axis) when the fixed points at both ends are unstable.
3 Linear games
Building on the analyses in Section 2, we can obtain more concrete results for general linear games. The
analysisinthisSection, inturn, canbedirectlyappliedtospecificlineargamestoproducetheresultsshown
in Figure 1.
11The payoff difference of an arbitrary linear 2×2 game with payoff matrix (cid:18)RS(cid:19) can be written as D(x)=
TP
(P+R−S−T)x+S−P. For such a game we can obtain an explicit expression for the internal fixed points
when γ =2 or γ =1/2, but the expression may be complicated. More, generally, we can often narrow down
thenumberofinternalfixedpointsdependingonthegame’spayoffmatrixandvalueofcomplexityparameter
γ.
The equation we must solve to obtain the fixed point becomes
(cid:18)
x
(cid:19)γ−1
1−α[(P +R−S−T)x+S−P] 2
= = −1.
1−x 1+α[(P +R−S−T)x+S−P] α[(P +R−S−T)x+S−P]+1
Observe that for γ >1, the left-hand side (LHS) is monotonic increasing. Conversely, for γ <1, the LHS
ismonotonicdecreasing. Thisyieldsthreenoteworthyscenarios: Firstly,inthecasewhereP+R−S−T =0
(characteristic of the Donation game), the right-hand side (RHS) remains constant, implying a maximum of
oneinternalfixedpointregardlessofγ’ssign. GiventhattheLHSisstrictlypositiveintheinteriorx∈(0,1),
the RHS must also be positive for a solution to exist. This condition necessitates that either S−P <0 and
α < 1/(P −S), or 0 < S−P and α < 1/(S−P) for an internal fixed point to be feasible; Secondly, when
P +R−S −T > 0 (typical of the Coordination game), the RHS is monotonically decreasing. Therefore,
there can be at most one internal fixed point if γ > 1, with the LHS increasing monotonically; Finally, if
P +R−S −T < 0 (it can be true, for example, in Prisoner’s dilemma and Snowdrift game depending on
the parameters), the RHS increases monotonically. In this scenario, there can be at most one internal fixed
point is possible if γ <1, corresponding with a monotonically decreasing LHS.
Regarding the stability of fixed points, we have
sign(1+αD| )=sign(1+α(S−P))
x=0
−sign(1−αD| )=−sign(1−α(R−T))
x=1
−sign(1−αD| )=−sign(1−α(S−P))
x=0
sign(1+αD| )=sign(1+α(R−T)).
x=1
Therefore, for γ <1
(cid:26) unstable iff P −S < 1
x=0 is α
stable iff 1 <P −S
α
(cid:26) unstable iff −1 <T −R
x=1 is α

There is a stable internal equilibrium if both P −S < 1/α and −1/α < T −R are true, and there is an
unstable internal equilibrium if both 1/α<P −S and T −R<−1/α are true.
For γ >1

x=0 is α
unstable iff P −S <−1
α
(cid:26) stable iff T −R< 1
x=1 is α
unstable iff 1 <T −R.

There is an unstable internal equilibrium if both −1/α<P −S and T −R<1/α are true, and there is
a stable internal if both P −S <−1/α and 1/α<T −R are true.

We further apply the following theorem regarding multivariate Bernstein polynomials on a simplex [44]
to obtain an approximation that is valid for sufficiently large n.
Theorem. Let g : ∆ → R be a continuous function where ∆ is a k-dimensional simplex defined as

∆ ={p⃗=(p ,··· ,p )∈[0,1]k :p +···+p ≤1}. Let

Then, B (p⃗) converges uniformly to f(p⃗) as v →∞.

We apply this theorem by letting g = ρXk→Xj,ρXj→Xk, k = m−1, p⃗=⃗x = (x 1,··· ,x m−1), and t = n.

5 An alternative construction of the process for multi-choice games
There is an alternative mechanism, parameterized by κ ∈ Z , that gives rise to the standard replicator
+
dynamics when κ=1. Suppose a focal individual i of type X samples κ opponents and considers switching
j
14to another type only if all opponents it interacts with are of that type. If all the opponents are of that type,
the transition occurs with some probability that depends on the difference in the payoff between the focal
individual’s original type and the opponents’ type. Specifically, the focal individual switches to that type
with probability

Under standard replicator dynamics (γ = 1), the dynamics leads to the all-defector state. Whereas for
γ >1, the population is attracted toward each monomorphic population state, and the strategy that is more
individually rational strategy has a larger basin of attraction. When γ <1, the population is attracted to a
mixed equilibrium with the more individually rational strategy having a higher frequency (Figure S1).

Figure S1: Three-strategy Prisoner’s Dilemma Each vertex represents the monomorphic population of each
strategy. The right and left bottom verteces represent full and moderate cooperators, and the top vertex represents
defectors. When γ = 1 (classic replicator equation), the dynamics exhibits a cyclic nature. It is attracted to each
monomorphic population when γ > 1 and attracted to the mixed strategy population when γ < 1. Parameters:
s=3,b =3,b =4,c =1,c =3.

S2 The dynamics of the alternative construction
The dynamics exhibited by the continuous limit ODE derived from the alternative construction is identical
to our main model when m=2, and it appears to remain similar when m=3 for some typical linear games
as shown in Figures S2 and S3.
