The in-house developed Patchkeeper firmware provides
comprehensive control over individual components of the
system. This includes the ability to turn on and off specific
sensors, as well as adjust their sampling mode and frequency.

type of data. Equipped with sensors such as ECG, PPG,
and IMU, a single Patchkeepr can serve as a platform with
multimodal sensors suitable for tracking outpatients released
from the hospital or users at home environments. It’s easy to

for both users and health care professionals.
Moreover, the PK is well suited for various research en-
deavors. We have used the PK for tracking abdominal body
sounds in subjects exposed to different levels of daily stresses
[18] and for heart rate information extraction [16]. Further-
more, we have also employed PK to quantify the personality
traits of dogs [19]. Additionally, the PK can be utilized for
applications such as monitoring premature babies or for smart
home applications including intelligent home monitoring and
predictive maintenance.REFERENCES the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC), Jul.
