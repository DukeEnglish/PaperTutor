Conclusion
The game of DouDiZhu is an extremely challenging in-
complete information game. It has a vast state/action
space and unique characteristics involving reasoning
about competition and cooperation, making the game
particularly difficult to solve. Research on DouDiZhu
typicallysimplifiesthegamebynotconsideringthebid-
ding phase and the "spring" bonus, as including these
factors increases the variance in rewards, making the
model harder to converge. Additionally, the inclusion
ofbiddingcancausedeviationsinthecarddistribution
compared to when bidding is not included.
Thispaperfirstincorporatesfactorslikebiddingand
the spring bonus to make the research environment
more closely resemble the actual DouDiZhu game en-
vironment. Secondly, it modifies the Deep Monte Carlo
algorithm framework, using reinforcement learning to
obtain a neural network that simultaneously estimates
win rates and expectations. The action space is pruned
using expectations, and strategies are generated based
on win rates. This modification allows the DMC algo-
rithm to produce strategies that are not solely depen-
dentonvalue(expectation)butalsoconsiderwinrates,
resulting in a state-of-the-art (SOTA) DouDiZhu rein-
forcement learning model, which we named AlphaDou.
We compared AlphaDou with the baseline program
DouZero, achieving a win rate of 0.6167 in an envi-
ronment with bidding. Even when there are differences
betweenthetrainingenvironmentwithbiddingandthe
testing environment without bidding, AlphaDou still
achieved a win rate of 0.5970 and an average score per
game of 0.4343, making it the SOTA RL model. RLA.The Combinations and Ranks of Cards
One of the challenges in the game of DouDiZhu is the vast state/action space, which includes numerous card combi-
nations. For certain categories, players can choose a "kick-out" card, which can be any card from their hand, directly
leading to a large action space. For the landlord player, the winning condition is to play all their cards, while farmer
players do not always need to play all their cards; their teammate clearing their hand also signifies victory. This re-

Table 9: Actions and Their Ranks in Doudizhu. Doudizhu uses a 54-card deck, which includes 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
10 (T), Jack (J), Queen (Q), King (K), Ace (A), 2, Black Joker (B) and Red Joker (R). Suits are irrelevant. “?”
and “*” denote any Solo or Pair, respectively. “F” and “V” denote fixed-length action and variable-length action,
respectively. This table is cited from (Luo and Tan 2024).B.Mixture of the Policy Makes the AI Stronger
Douzero has open-sourced two model weights: douzero-wp, which uses win rate as the reward, and douzero-adp,
which uses expectation as the reward. Douzero generates strategies based on the maximum output of douzero-adp.
We propose the following two methods to consider both douzero-wp and douzero-adp models simultaneously to
generate strategies:
1. Bomb check: Check for factors that influence the final reward. If none exist, choose the move with the highest
win rate based on douzero-wp output. Factors influencing the final reward include spring reward and bomb reward.
Douzero does not consider the spring reward, so this step is to determine the presence of a bomb.
2. Mixed strategy (Mix): Prune moves based on the expectation derived from douzero-adp. We consider moves
withanexpectationdifferencewithinacertainpercentagerange(ρ=0.05)fromthemaximumexpectationasviable
moves. Then, select the move with the highest win rate among the viable moves.
We can derive four different RL models for generating strategies: douzero, douzero with only Bomb check (Bomb
check), douzero with only mixed strategy (Mix), and douzero with Bomb check followed by mixed strategy (Bomb
check & Mix). We tested the performance of these four models against douzero in fixed 4000 game scenarios at
different positions (landlord, farmer). The specific results are displayed in the Table 10. It can be seen that both
Bomb Check and Mixed strategy yield better strategies than the standalone douzero-adp. Bomb Check followed by
Mixed strategy achieves the best strategy.
