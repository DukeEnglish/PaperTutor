1 Introduction
Many elections are conducted sequentially, where interim results are known to the electorate and
can be used by voters to inform their decisions. Given empirical work showing that voters tend to
vote for the leading candidates when votes are public [MM+15; ZM+15; RR+17; MG+20; AG22],
it is natural to consider the strategic aspect of choosing when to vote under such settings.
An illustration of the power of strategic vote timing is given by the commonplace show-of-
hands vote: “early bird” voters may sway undecided voters to follow in their direction. Moreover,
if there are costs associated with voting (e.g., having to commute to a distant polling station),
waiting to observe interim results allows voters to save costs, if their preferred outcome appears to
have garnered enough support to win. In particular, previous work found that voting costs affect
voter turnout in blockchain governance voting, where votes are irrevocable and interim results are
public [DY+23; MP+23]. This also applies to settings in which costs may be implicit, such as
in democratic deliberation dialogues [FP+23] and social networks [AB+12], where voters may face

1v67790.2042:viXrasocial consequences if their vote does not conform to the accepted norms (e.g., liking a controversial
social media post).
Importantly, the ability of agents to strategically time their votes may harm others, if it de-
lays the time until a decisive majority is reached. This consideration is significant for blockchain
governance mechanisms [KL22], in which failure to promptly converge to a decision on how to
address critical flaws in a protocol can result in significant losses [Cha23; Per23; Mou23; You23;
Nor22]. Alarmingly, the average time to reach a quorum1 may be large (1.64 days on average in
Compound [MP+23]), with this risk exacerbated by mechanisms that extend voting deadlines due
to last-minute voting [Ope24].
Although prior art examined related topics, a review of the literature identifies that an analysis
of the strategic aspect of vote timing in the presence of voting costs and public tallies is missing (see
Section 1.2 and Table 1). These aspects are shown to be inherently connected by both empirical
and experimental studies, which find that access to interim results informs voters’ actions in two
crucial ways: voting “bandwagons” form where voters increase their support for a candidate in the
lead, while voters may abstain to save costs if the results indicate that their preferred candidate
will probably win or, conversely, cannot win [MM+15; ZM+15; RR+17; MG+20; AG22]. These
findings motivate our research question, the answer to which could serve to inform the design of
better voting procedures:
To what extent do voting costs and access to interim results affect voter behavior, when
voters can strategically time their votes?
1.1 Our Contributions
In our work, we provide an answer to this question by analyzing the timing game that arises in
sequential voting procedures with public interim results, in which private-value voters incur a cost
for voting, and can choose when to vote, if at all. Thus, our main conceptual contribution is a
novel model in which the strategic aspect of vote timing is informed by both voting costs and
access to interim results. Our main technical contribution is twofold. First, we prove the existence
of equilibria where voters mix between voting early and late. While prior work on strategic vote
timing by private-valued agents considers settings where mixed equilibria exist only when all voters
have at least two preferred candidates (out of three) [DP14; TL17], our existence result is for voters
who may have a strict preference for one candidate (out of two). Second, we characterize several
typesofequilibriathatareofparticularrelevancefortheblockchainsetting,asdependentonvarious
parameters such as the cost of voting. In total, our analysis of the strategic choice of when to vote
is a natural companion to the literature on the strategic decision of choosing who to vote for [ST21;
HS+23], and on sequential elections with an exogenous voting order [AB+12; MT23].
Our model. We consider competitive elections between two candidates F and A, where the elec-
torate is divided among three equally-sized voting blocs. Each candidate is backed by one bloc of
“informed” voters who incur a cost of c if they vote, and have private values that determine their
utility: they get a utility of 1 if their candidate wins, and −1 if the candidate loses. Thus, the
outcome critically hinges on the third bloc, which comprises of “uninformed” swing voters who are
swayed by the interim tally at the time of voting, to the extent that they vote in favor of the leading
candidate, and choose one uniformly in case there is a tie. The elections proceed in turns, where
at each turn, the interim tally (i.e., the number of votes cast for each candidate) is available to all
agents, who can use them to inform their decisions. In particular, our voters may account for the

if less votes are cast, even if all are in favor.

tally when choosing their actions at each turn. Informed voters can choose between exercising their
right to vote, and either waiting for the next turn, or abstaining if the voting window has ended.
On the other hand, uninformed voters arrive to the ballot over time according to a probability
distribution⃗q. We provide a schematic depiction of our agents’ action space in Fig. 1.
Last stage analysis. Whilevotershaveaccesstotheinterimresults,weshowinSection3thatthis
does not translate into having complete information over the state of the game. Consider that from
the point of view of a voter in favor of F, observing an interim tally that indicates a tie between the
candidatesmayleadtosubstantiallydifferentactionsifallvotesthusfarforAcamefromuninformed
voters, while for F came from informed voters; in this case, the remaining informed voting power in
favor of A is greater than that of F. Yet, interim tallies only provide the number of votes supporting
each candidate, and not the identities of the voters that cast them. Thus, we analyze our game
through the lens of the weak perfect Bayesian equilibrium (WPBE) solution concept, which lends
itself to sequential games of incomplete information. It requires agent strategies to be sequentially
rational, given that voters update their beliefs about the current state of the world in a Bayesian
manner. We show in Propositions 3.1 and 3.2 that WPBE strategy profiles for the last stage of
our game exhibit a “threshold” structure: voting dominates for costs lower than the threshold and
abstaining dominates above it. Moreover, these thresholds are determined, in part, according to
agent beliefs with respect to the identities of those who voted in previous turns. For example, if
an agent estimates that votes in favor of its preference were cast by uninformed voters, it may be
profitable to act as a “free rider” and abstain (Proposition 3.3).
Timing game analysis. In preparation of our key technical contributions, we examine the “timing
game” that forms when considering all voting stages (see Fig. 2). Thus, in Propositions 4.1 and 4.2
3and Corollary 4.3, we consider the impact of each game state on voter utility, when accounting for
their beliefs. These are then applied to reach our main results, where we analyze several emergent
behaviors that are of importance to our setting. For example, Messias et al. [MP+23] highlighted
the possibility of blockchain governance voters “mimicking” their peers by waiting and observing
their votes. To capture this scenario, we characterize in Theorem 4.6 all equilibria strategy profiles
that arise when uninformed voters never vote in the first turn, but rather only in later stages of
the voting game, i.e., when q = 0. As shown in Fig. 3, early voting becomes a dominant strategy.

Intuitively, this is because informed agents can therefore influence the votes of the uninformed
agents. We proceed with Theorem 4.7, in which we characterize “late-bloomer” equilibria, where
informed agents vote at the last minute. This case is important for governance protocols, which
may be required to accept or reject urgent proposals that can seriously affect the security of user
funds [Cha23; Per23; Mou23; You23; Nor22]. Some protocols may even delay voting deadlines in
response to late-stage voting [Ope24], thus increasing the risk from late-bloomer equilibria. Using
ouranalyticalcharacterization,theresultsofwhicharesummarizedinFig.4,weemployanumerical
simulation to evaluate the average cost threshold that corresponds to the different kinds of such
equilibria. Thus, we find that for general values of q > 0, the minimal average threshold equals
1
0.57, i.e., more than half of the maximal utility that voters can receive from voting. We culminate
with Theorem 4.10, which shows the existence of equilibria strategies where informed voters mix
between voting early and late.
1.2 Related Work
Strategic vote timing is inherently a hard problem in game design. Therefore, prior work mostly
suggests stylized models, backed up with solutions only for limited game settings or subsets of the
strategy space. Our review of the literature shows that strategic timing and disclosure of votes are
often discussed in the context of sequential voting, where vote timing can either be exogenous or
endogenous. We review related works along these two scenarios and illustrate how our model differs
in terms of the underlying assumptions, with a summary given in Table 1. Furthermore, we present
an in-depth review of the literature in Appendix B, which covers a variety of works, ranging from
empirical blockchain papers to theoretical works on corporate governance.
Exogenous timing. In exogenous timing voting models, agents vote at predetermined times,
and cannot strategically choose when to vote. The closest work to ours is by Mamageishvili &
Tejada [MT23], who suggest a model of a large electorate divided into two groups of voters voting
sequentially. Voters choose from two alternatives, have a common voting cost, and voters in the
second group know the first group’s turnout, but not the interim results. In contrast to our work,
members of the first group who abstain are not allowed to vote in the second round. The authors
prove the existence of a perfect Bayesian equilibrium in which the expected number of votes for
each alternative is equal. Intuitively, this happens due to a direct effect of the early voters who
vote for their preferred outcome, and an indirect effect of the late voters who consider the interim
turnout when deciding whether to vote or abstain. Battaglini et al. [BM+07] examine a sequential
voting game with 3 voters and formulate a unique path of equilibrium in pure strategies for all
voting costs. Dekel & Piccione [DP00] show that information cascades, i.e., learning from the votes
of others, do not happen in an equilibrium of binary voting schemes with exogenous timing. We
take a different design approach and intentionally introduce two types of voters, thereby allowing
a potential “learning (or influencer) effect” to manifest. Other works [Pik00; Cal07; AB+12], in
contrast, compare simultaneous and sequential timing mechanisms in a costless setting.
Endogenous timing. Another line of theoretical research models vote timing as an endogenous
factor and hence, is closer to our model. However, most works in this stream of research seek to
4Table 1: Overview of related works on sequential voting. We classify works into three categories.
The first includes works that analyze settings where the time in which agents vote is exogenously
determined (“exo.”). The second includes works that analyze common value elections and endoge-
nous (“endo.”) vote timing where voters choose when to vote, thus the existence of equilibria where
voters mix between voting at various times is due to the benefits of such strategies to information
aggregation (“info. aggr”). The third includes this work, Tsang & Larson [TL17] and Dekel &
Piccione [DP14], that analyze endogenous vote timing in private value elections, and prove the ex-
istence of equilibria that admit mixed strategies using various modeling assumptions, as mentioned
in “Existence of mixed timing eq.” (see Section 1.2 for in-depth details).

round costless voting game with 3 candidates and 3 voters with a preference structure following the
Condorcet cycle. They show that playing a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium applies to a complete
information game. In contrast, our model requires strictly one alternative to be favored by the
informed voters and assumes no additional restrictions on a preference structure. Furthermore, we
consider a costly voting mechanism and condition the existence of a mixed-strategy equilibrium on
the presence of an uninformed type of voters.
Empirical & experimental works. Our model follows findings made by both empirical and
experimental works across different voting domains, such as national elections and online voting.
Thus, Morton et al. [MM+15] find that in French presidential elections held between 1981 and
2012, the availability of exit polls at the time of voting increases the probability of voters voting for
the expected winner. Similarly, Araújo and Gatto [AG22] use data from Brazil’s 2018 presidential
5
noitnetsbAelections to show that access to official tallies prior to voting led subsequent voters to increase their
support for the frontrunning candidate, and decrease it for losing candidates. Zou et al. [ZM+15]
analyze data from 345 thousand open Doodle polls, and find that votes positively correlate with
preceding ones. A larger data set comprising more than 1.3 million Doodle polls is studied by
Romero et al. [RR+17], who find that early voters exert a larger influence on a poll’s result than
late voters. Meir, Gal & Tal [MG+20] conduct controlled online experiments that simulate real-
world voting procedures, and show that participants can be classified into several types, where some

In summary, our model stands out from previous studies in that it explicitly captures strategic
timing and the learning effect applied to the group of uninformed voters. Voters may prefer, in
certaincases,toabstainfromvotingtosavecosts. Also,thepurposeofouranalysisisnottoexamine
conditions that facilitate better information aggregation, but rather to study voting dynamics given
that a certain fraction of the electorate votes “with the herd”.
2 Preliminaries
In this work, we focus on the importance of vote timing in swaying undecided voters when interim
tallies are public. Thus, we consider an electorate consisting of informed voters who have a pre-
determined preference for a specific outcome, and uninformed voters who are undecided and use
interim results when choosing how to vote. To capture the strategic aspect of vote timing, we let
informed voters make the strategic choice of deciding when to vote. We furthermore consider a
setting in which voting is costly for informed voters, and uninformed voters stochastically arrive to
vote over the span of the voting period. These two aspects of our model incentivize informed voters
to mix between voting early to influence future uninformed voters, and waiting to observe interim
results, thereby avoiding voting costs if their vote cannot affect the final outcome.
Voting mechanism. A referendum is held to decide whether a proposal should be adopted. The
ballotforthevoteisopenforT ∈ Nturns. Whentheballotisopen, voterscanvoteFinfavorofthe
proposal, or A against it. Furthermore, voters may choose to not vote at all. Votes are irrevocable
and cast simultaneously within each period, and — importantly — the interim results after each
turn are observable before the following turn. In particular, interim results are anonymous, i.e.,
the identity or type of those who cast these votes is not disclosed. The winning outcome is chosen
according to the majority vote rule after all turns. In case of a tie, the winner is chosen by a fair
coin flip. We denote the tally of votes cast before turn t by θ = (cid:10) θF,θA(cid:11) ∈ (N∪{0})2, where θF
t t t t
and θA are the counts of F and A votes, respectively, and define θF = θA = 0 for the first turn.

Uninformed voters. Uninformedvotersdonotstrictlypreferoneoutcomeoveranother,butvalue

voting in the first round, uninformed voters choose to vote either F or A with an equal probability.
Uninformed arrivals. The distribution of uninformed arrivals is characterized by a probability
vector⃗q = (q ,...,q ),whereq ∈ [0,1]denotestheprobabilityofarrivinginroundt,and(cid:80)T q ≤
1 T t t=1 t
1. A strict inequality ((cid:80)T q < 1) implies that uninformed voters may abstain.
t=1 t
Informed voters. Informed voters are classified into two types according to their preferred out-
come. If an informed voter is in favor of the proposal, we denote its type by F. Such voters receive
a utility of 1 if the proposal passes, and −1 otherwise. Similarly, A denotes informed voters who are
againsttheproposal, withvotersofthistypegaining−1iftheproposalisadopted, and1otherwise.
Both types incur a voting cost c ∈ [0,1), but can abstain to avoid it.
6Informed actions. Immediately before the referendum begins, informed voters observe ⃗q. After
the ballot opens, in each turn t ∈ 1,...,T, informed voters who have not yet cast a vote observe
the interim tally θ , and then choose an action; voters may either: (1) vote for their preference,
t
(2) wait until the next turn (if t < T), or (3) abstain (if t = T). As votes are irrevocable, if an
informed voter has cast its vote, it does not have any action available to it in the following turns.
In particular, we are interested in instances where informed voters cast their votes in the first and
last rounds, which we respectively call voting early and late. We denote the set of all actions by
S d=ef{vote,wait,abstain}, and the set of all distributions over these actions by ∆(S).
Informed strategies. Denote the set of informed voters by V. A strategy s for voter v ∈ V is a
mapping between its type and a game state to a distribution over S. A game state is defined by
a distribution of uninformed arrivals q, a turn index t, and the tally up to that turn θ = (cid:10) θF,θA(cid:11).
t t t
Given a game state, we denote the strategy of an informed voter v of type τ by s (cid:0) q,t,θF,θA,τ(cid:1).
v t t
2.1 Solution Concept
We analyze weak perfect Bayesian equilibria, which are natural for multi-turn games of incomplete
information [FT91]. We focus on strategy profiles that are symmetric “within” and “across” types.
Symmetry within types. Let V be the set of type τ voters. A strategy profile is symmetric
τ
within τ if, for any state, all voters in V use the same strategy: ∀v,v′ ∈ V : s (cid:0) q,t,θF,θA,τ(cid:1) =
τ v t t
s
(cid:0) q,t,θF,θA,τ(cid:1).
v′ t t
Symmetry across types. A strategy profile is called symmetric across types if for any state, for
all voters, the strategy of both types is symmetric when considering the amount of votes cast by
each: ∀θF,θA ∈ N∪{0} : s (cid:0) q,t,θF,θA,F(cid:1) = s (cid:0) q,t,θA,θF,A(cid:1).
t t v t t v t t
Simplified notations. For profiles that are symmetric within both types, we simplify our nota-
tions and omit v, i.e., use s(cid:0) q,t,θF,θA,τ(cid:1) instead of s (cid:0) q,t,θF,θA,τ(cid:1). Furthermore, without loss
t t v t t
of generality (w.l.o.g.), for profiles that are symmetric across types, we focus our analysis on F
type voters. Thus, we omit voter types from our notations, and succinctly denote strategies by
s(cid:0) q,t,θF,θA(cid:1).
t t
Information sets. Although voters can view the interim tally at each state, this does not always
suffice for them to deduce the state they are in, because they do not know who voted. As we show,
the identity of previous voters (i.e., whether they are informed or not) can be crucial. If a voter
cannot distinguish between several states, we say that they belong to the same information set. For
consistency, we use the term to also refer to sets that comprise a single state, and thus voters have
complete information upon reaching them.
WPBE. The WPBE solution concept allows us to reason about sequential games with incomplete
information, where players update their beliefs in a Bayesian manner. Intuitively, WPBE requires
that for states that have a positive probability of being reached, player beliefs are always consistent
with Bayes’ rule.
Definition 2.1 (WPBE). A WPBE is a belief system b and a strategy profile s such that:
• Thebeliefsystemb(·|I)is consistentgivenstrategyprofiles: itdefinesaconditionalprobability
distribution over the states contained in information set I for all possible information sets,
and beliefs are derived using Bayes’ rule for any information set that is reached with a strictly
positive probability under s.
• The strategy profile s is sequentially rational given belief system b, meaning that for any
information set I, following the strategy s(I) maximizes an agent’s expected utility according
to b(·|I), when played from I onward.
7Remark 2.2. Given an information set I and state σ ∈ I, recall that Bayes’ rule is defined as
P(I|σ)P(σ)
P(σ|I) = , i.e., the probability of an agent being in state σ given that the agent is in
P(I)
information set I, equals the conditional probability of being in information set I, conditioned on
the probability of being in state σ, times the probability of being in σ, divided by the probability of
being in information set I. As we show in Section 3, the information set that a voter reaches at
any given turn is defined according to the interim tally and the voter’s action in the preceding turn.
Thus, voters can discern to which information set they have arrived (while they cannot necessarily
discern the specific state within the set). This implies that as σ ∈ I, we have P(I|σ) = 1, and thus
P(σ)
we get: P(σ|I) = . Conversely, for σ ∈/ I, we get P(I|σ) = 0, and thus also P(σ|I) = 0.
P(I)
2.2 Timing Game
Due to the complexity of our game, we focus on the strategic behavior of voters facing a two-period
voting window T d=ef2, given that the electorate consists of an uninformed voter, an informed voter
in favor of F, and an informed voter supporting A. Intuitively, our setting is inherently that of
imperfect but complete information. Informed voters know the interim tally at each round, yet
they do not always know who voted in all the game’s different information sets. This uncertainty
prevents voters from discerning whether they can affect the vote’s outcome and introduces risk:
voting in such states may lower utility. As we show, in equilibria, rational informed voters account
for the probability of reaching such states.
We proceed with an overview of our game (summarized in Fig. 1 and depicted in full in Fig. 2),
and then succinctly describe our approach to solving the game and finding equilibrium strategies.
Overview. The game tree presented in Fig. 2 takes the perspective of the informed voter F and
accountsforthearrivaloftheuninformedvoterinperiodt (withprobabilityq ,seetheupperpart),
1 1
t

(with probability q 2, see the medium part), or abstaining (with probability q∅ = (1−q
1
−q 2),
see the bottom part). The slope branches represent two strategies available to the informed F-type
voter: vote and wait in period t , or vote and abstain in the next period t only in those subgames
1 2
which start with the wait strategy in t . The cornered branches represent moves of other voters.

The interim and final results are specified in form of the observed tally of votes. The last two
columns of the game tree decode each tuple of the tally with a sequence of the informed F-type
voter’s move (F or X in case of abstaining), the informed A-type voter’s move, and the uninformed
voter’s move (F, A or X depending on the outcome of the game). The utility for each leaf node is
provided with respect to the informed F-type voter.
Information sets. There are several information sets within this game, in which the informed
F-type voter is not able to distinguish between the moves of the A-type or the uninformed voters.
For instance, the interim tally ⟨1,1⟩ forms a set with three states, in which the informed F-type
voter has voted, but is uncertain about the origin of the opposing vote A. The information set ⟨1,0⟩
(in blue) models a situation, in which the informed F-type voter has no further action available,
yet is uncertain whether the opponents will cast a vote or abstain. The information set ⟨0,0⟩ (in

set ⟨0,1⟩ (in green), the informed F-type voter may choose from the two actions, however cannot
determine whether the registered A-vote belongs to the informed A-type voter or the uninformed
voter arriving and voting in period t based on the outcome of a coin toss. Finally, the single node

⟨1,0⟩ (in a “white” double circle) captures the state, in which the informed F-type player observes
the F vote of the uninformed voter.
Solving the game. Recall that a F type voter can either vote early, or wait to view the interim

3 Information Set Analysis
We proceed by analyzing each of our game’s information sets from the perspective of F type voters.
Recall that we analyze the game via backward induction, thus we focus on second-turn information
sets where agents have actions available to them. In particular, these sets are reachable only by
waiting in the first turn: if agents voted in the first turn, they do not have any action available to
them until the game is over. Among these sets, the ones that are of the most interest are those
in which voters have at least two undominated strategies. For each such set, we characterize a
cost threshold: voting dominates when voting costs are lower than the threshold, while abstaining
dominates if they are higher.
3.1 Sets With Undominated Strategies
Mustard set. In Proposition 3.1, we analyze the information set that encompasses all states
where the interim results equal ⟨0,0⟩ that are reachable if both informed voters wait in the first
turn. In Fig. 2, such states are colored in mustard. Intuitively, Proposition 3.1 implies that in this
information set, informed voters highly account for the arrival distribution of uninformed voters
when choosing whether to vote or not. Thus, informed votes would rather abstain if, given the
distribution, it is unlikely that uninformed voters would turn out to vote, and would vote only if it
is cheap to do so, i.e., when c is low. As this information set corresponds to the second turn, one
can deduce that uninformed voters have a low likelihood of voting in the following cases:
• If uninformed voters tend to vote early, i.e., as q approaches one.
1
• If uninformed voters do not tend to vote in the second round, i.e., when q approaches zero.

Equilibrium analysis. Recall that this information set contains at most two states, and that
under our notations, the probability assigned to voting in this set is denoted by p . In the state
2,⟨0,0⟩
that corresponds to the uninformed voter abstaining, the game becomes a prisoner’s dilemma:
• First, we examine the cases where the F-type voter votes. With probability p , the other
2,⟨0,0⟩
informed voter also votes, thus we have a tie and a winner is chosen at random: F wins with
probability 1 (giving a utility of 1−c), and A wins with the same probability (netting a utility of
2
−1−c),resultinginanexpectedutilityequalto 1·(1−c−1−c) = −c. Conversely,theopponent
2
does not vote with probability 1−p , in which case F wins and a utility of 1−c is gained.
2,⟨0,0⟩
The total expected utility of voting is: (cid:0) 1−p (cid:1) ·(1−c)+p ·(−c) = 1−c−p .
2,⟨0,0⟩ 2,⟨0,0⟩ 2,⟨0,0⟩
• If the F-type voter abstains, then if the informed opponent abstains (with probability 1−p ),
2,⟨0,0⟩
a utility of 0 is gained as a winner is chosen at random. On the other hand, the opponent votes
with probability p , resulting in a utility equal to −1. Thus, the exepected utility in this case
2,⟨0,0⟩
equals: (cid:0) 1−p (cid:1) ·0+p ·(−1) = −p .
2,⟨0,0⟩ 2,⟨0,0⟩ 2,⟨0,0⟩
On the other hand, if the uninformed voter does not abstain, then it will randomly choose who to
vote for in the second period, as no votes were cast for both options at the time of voting.
• Consider the case where the F-type voter votes. The A-type voter abstains with probability
1−p , in which case a utility of 1−c is obtained if the uninformed voter’s random decision
2,⟨0,0⟩
results in voting for F, and a utility of −c is gained if the uninformed voter cast a vote for A. As
the vote of the uninformed voter is decided with a uniform probability, the expected utility for
this subcase is (cid:0) 1−p (cid:1) ·(cid:0)1 −c(cid:1). With probability p , the A-type voter does vote and
2,⟨0,0⟩ 2 2,⟨0,0⟩
we obtain an expected utility of p (−c): if the uninformed voter chose F the utility is 1−c,
2,⟨0,0⟩
while it is −1−c if the uninformed votes for A. In total, the expected utility of both subcases is:
(cid:0) 1−p (cid:1) ·(cid:0)1 −c(cid:1) +p ·(−c) = 1 −c− p 2,⟨0,0⟩.
2,⟨0,0⟩ 2 2,⟨0,0⟩ 2 2
• In case the F-type voter abstains, then with probability 1 − p the A-type voter abstains
2,⟨0,0⟩
as well, thus the outcome depends solely on the uninformed voter’s random choice, resulting in
an expected utility of 0. With probability p , the A-type voter votes. In this sub-case, the
2,⟨0,0⟩
expected utility is −1: if the uninformed voter voted for F, then we have a tie and the utility is
2
0, while if the uninformed vote was for A then the utility equals −1. In total, the expected utility
equals: (cid:0) 1−p (cid:1) ·0+p ·(cid:0) −1(cid:1) = −p 2,⟨0,0⟩.
2,⟨0,0⟩ 2,⟨0,0⟩ 2 2
In sequentially rational equilibria strategies that involve both voting and abstaining, voters
should be indifferent between the two actions in this information set’s states, given their beliefs on
11the probability of reaching each state. Thus, the expected utility should satisfy the following.

When Eq. (3) is solved, we obtain: c = 1+ q 2 . Furthermore, substituting this result in the

expected utility reveals that abstention is domin1 ant in this information set when c > 1+ q 2 ,
2(q −1)
and voting is dominant when c < 1+ q 2 . This allows us to write the equilibrium strategy1 as a

interim tally equal to ⟨0,1⟩, which are colored in green in Fig. 2. This set is interesting, as upon

White set. The last information set that has at least two undominated strategies is the one that
consists of all states with an interim tally of ⟨1,0⟩ which are reachable by waiting in the first turn.
Although there is only one such state and thus there is no uncertainty for the F-type voter upon
reaching it, it proves critical for our analysis of the first stage of the game, as in this state, our voter
can enjoy the “free rider” effect: the single vote in support of F is surely cast by the uninformed
agent, implying that in certain cases, the F-type voter may be able to avoid incurring the cost of
voting, yet still have its preferred candidate win. This state is denoted by two nested circles that

3.2 Sets With Dominated Strategies or no Actions
While the information sets with undominated strategies are of particular interest, we emphasize
that the others are important for our analysis of first-turn voter strategies. Thus, we go over them.
12Sets With Available Actions. Therearetwoinformationsetswithdominatedstrategiesinwhich
voters have actions available to them. In the first case, we prove in Proposition 3.4 that abstaining
dominates voting for almost all c values, while voting dominates in the second set, as shown by
Proposition 3.5.
Proposition 3.4. Given that the F type voter did not vote early and a state with interim tally equal
(cid:40)
0, c > 0
to ⟨0,2⟩ is reached, the equilibrium strategy is: p = .
2,⟨0,2⟩
indifference, c = 0
Proof. There is just one state which has a tally of ⟨0,2⟩ and is reachable by not voting in the first
turn. According to the interim tally, our F-type voter cannot tilt the outcome, as there are two
votes for A. Thus, voting is futile and results in a utility of −1−c. Abstaining gives a utility of −1,
and thus strictly dominates voting when c > 0.
Proposition 3.5. Given that the F type voter did not vote early and a state with interim tally equal
to ⟨1,1⟩ is reached, the equilibrium strategy is: p = 1.
2,⟨1,1⟩
Proof. The described set contains exactly one state. In this state, as the F-type voter waited in the
first turn and as two other voters have voted, one can deduce that all uninformed and F-type voters
have voted. Thus, the F-type voter can vote in the current turn and ensure that F reigns supreme,
netting a utility of 1−c. On the other hand, abstaining will result in the winner being chosen by
a coin-flip, and thus in a utility equal to 0. As by definition we have c < 1, this means that voting
strictly dominates abstaining.
Sets With No Available Action. There are five information sets in which voters have no action
available to them. In particular, these sets are reachable only for agents who voted in the first turn.
• The set containing all states with an interim tally equal to ⟨1,1⟩. We highlight these with
red dotted circles in Fig. 2. The states in this set are indistinguishable for voters if the
uninformed arrival probability is not entirely concentrated in a single event, i.e., if at least
one of the following holds: q ̸= 1, q ̸= 1, or q +q ̸= 1.
1 2 1 2
• The set consisting of all states that have an interim tally of ⟨1,0⟩. These states are denoted
in Fig. 2 by dashed blue circles. We note that voters can distinguish between the set’s states
if either q = 0, or q +q = 1.
2 1 2
• The states with interim tallies equal to ⟨2,0⟩, ⟨2,1⟩, and ⟨1,2⟩ correspond each to a separate
“singleton” information set comprising a single state. As each set contains just one state,
voters have full information upon reaching them.
4 Timing Game Analysis
So far, we have analyzed information sets that are reachable only if the F voter did not vote early.
Weproceedtoexaminethe“timinggame” thatariseswhenvotersstrategicallychoosewhentovote,
including the possibility of voting early.
134.1 Utility of Voting Early and Waiting
We first write the expected utility that can be gained from either voting in the first turn, or waiting
to the second one. We denote the expected utility of the informed F-type voter from voting early by
UF and from waiting by UF . In Propositions 4.1 and 4.2 we explicitly derive these expected
vote,t1 wait
utilities. Briefly, both values are obtained by analyzing all possible outcomes for following the
respective strategy (i.e., either voting early or waiting), and summing the resulting utilities. The
full proofs are given in Appendix A.
Proposition 4.1. The utility gained from voting early is:
UF = (1−p )·(1−q +(1−q −q )·p )−c

Our analysis relies on comparing the utility of voting early with that of waiting. To this end,
we present two useful results in Corollaries 4.3 and 4.4, both of which are proven in Appendix A.
Corollary 4.3. The difference in utility between voting early and voting late is:

4.2 Equilibria Analysis
We proceed by analyzing the different possible equilibria for our timing game. For large regimes
of our parameter space, we provide a precise characterization. Several types of equilibria are of
particular interest to us:
• Messias et al. [MP+23] conduct an empirical analysis of blockchain governance protocols, and
identify a potential risk in voters “mimicking” their peers by waiting to observe their votes.
We analyze this case by setting q = 0, implying that uninformed agents never vote early. We
1
characterize all equilibria in Theorem 4.6, with a summary given in Fig. 4.
• We continue by characterizing all equilibria where informed voters vote late in Theorem 4.7.
This is important for governance protocols, as they may extend voting delays as a response
to late voting, and this may adversely affect the safety of user funds, if the proposals voted
on are related to security issues [Cha23; Per23; Mou23; You23; Nor22].

Webeginbyfullycharacterizingthecasewhereq = 0inProposition4.5andTheorem4.6, with

strategies reduce to a clean characterization.
Proposition 4.5. When q = 0, second turn strategy profiles are determined solely according to the
1
exogenous parameters c and⃗q. Moreover, we have that voters are indifferent with regards to (w.r.t.)
p , and that:

p = 1 and that voters are indifferent w.r.t. p . In all cases, voters are indifferent w.r.t. p .

When q > 0, the relationship between p and p becomes more intricate and requires
1 2,⟨0,1⟩ 2,⟨1,0⟩
delicate analysis. In Theorem 4.7, we prove the existence of equilibria that admit strategy profiles
where waiting dominates voting early, which we refer to as “late-bloomer” equilibria. Our proof is
given in Appendix A. It is constructive, and proceeds by increasingly refining our parameter space
until obtaining a characterization of the parameter regimes that correspond to the examined type
of equilibria. In Fig. 4, we present a summary of our characterization.
Theorem 4.7. If q > 0, there are feasible parameter regimes where waiting dominates voting
1
early. Moreover, equilibria strategy profiles have: p = 0, p = c and p = 1 − c, while
1 2,⟨0,1⟩ 2,⟨1,0⟩
the value of p varies according to the parameter regime, where p = 0 in the high cost

1
when this probability is low (Proposition 4.8, which characterizes two complementary parameter
regimes). Intuitively, this is due to the inability of informed voters to influence the uninformed
decision. In particular, for the lower cost regime of Proposition 4.9, we have that p = 1, and
2,⟨0,0⟩
for the higher cost regime of Proposition 4.8 has p = 0. Via numeric evaluations, we find that

Intuitively, the above results imply the following:
• In Proposition 4.8, we characterize strategy profiles for the “high cost regime”, i.e., when c is
relatively large. We show that in such cases, voters tend to leave the outcome to chance due
to the high voting costs, which harm the utility they may gain by voting. Thus, informed
voters do not vote in the first turn, and if they observe that noone else has voted, they abstain
altogether. If there is a single vote against their preference, they vote with a high probability;
in this case, the opposing vote presents itself as an immediate threat, and countering it by
voting is worth the cost. Via numerical simulations, we find that the average cost threshold
for this regime is 0.76.
• For lower costs, we characterize corresponding strategy profiles in Proposition 4.9, and show
that the lower costs lead voters to slightly change their behavior. Specifically, they always
vote upon reaching the so-called “mustard” information set, which has a tally of ⟨0,0⟩. Our
characterization implies that such equilibria correspond to parameter regimes where voting
costs are lower and q is significantly larger than q . Thus, upon reaching the second turn
1 2
and observing that no votes were cast, it is likely that the uninformed agent would abstain.
By using numerical simulations, we reach an average cost threshold of 0.57 for this case.
Finally, we show in Theorem 4.10 that there are equilibria where voters mix between voting
early and late. The proof is given in Appendix A. In it, we use second-stage equilibria strategies to
gradually confine p into a restricted parameter regime. Then, we culminate by showing that the
1
resulting parameter ranges are non-empty.
Theorem 4.10. When q > 0, there exist equilibria strategy profiles where q ∈ (0,1).

5 Conclusion
We propose a novel model of strategic voting timing which differs from prior works in several
important aspects. First, we introduce “informed” voters who have a strict preference over the
binary outcome, and “uninformed” voters who can be swayed by the interim public tally at the time
of voting. Second, we study the effect of voting costs on voters’ equilibrium strategies, and how
different parameter regimes may incentivize them to either vote early, vote late, or abstain. Our
theoretical results show that informed voters will choose a certain equilibrium path of voting or mix
between voting early and late as a function of the cost of voting, and the distribution of the time
at which uninformed voters arrive to the ballot. This could be of interest and practical relevance to
both voters and operators of such elections.

22A Proofs
This section contains all proofs that were omitted from the body of the paper due to space con-
straints.
Proposition 3.2. The equilibrium strategy for states with an interim tally equal to ⟨0,1⟩ is:

1, c < 1+

Proof. We proceed similarly to the proof of Proposition 3.1.
States. This set contains states with an interim tally of p = 1 where the only vote that was
2,⟨0,1⟩
cast in the first period was for A.
Beliefs. This information set is distinguished from other second-stage sets because F-type agents
cannot always discern whether the vote for A was cast by another informed agent, or by an un-
informed one. There are three states contained within this set, all of which are reachable only
if informed voters do not surely vote early, i.e., p < 1. The first state belonging to this set is
1
reached if uninformed agents vote early (q > 0) for A, and if informed agents do not always vote
1
early (p < 1). By definition, if the uninformed indeed voted early, the choice between F and A is
1
determined by a coin toss and thus has probability 1, thus the probability of reaching this state
2
equals (1−p )·q ·1. The second state is reachable when the uninformed votes in the second round
1 1 2
(q > 0) and informed voters assign non-zero probability to voting early (p > 0). It has a probabil-
2 1
ity of p ·q of being reached. Finally, the third state is reached with probability p ·(1−q −q ).
1 2 1 1 2
It can only be reached when q +q < 1, and if both the uninformed abstains, and informed voters
1 2
sometime vote early (p > 0). Thus, the probability of reaching any of these states is:
1
(cid:16) q (cid:17) (cid:16) q (cid:17) 1
(1−p ) 1 +p q +(p (1−q −q )) = (1−p ) 1 +(p (1−q )) = (q +p (2−3q )) (4)
1 2 1 2 1 1 2 1 2 1 1 2 1 1 1
Given Eq. (4), we calculate the conditional probability of being in each of the set’s states. The
probability of being in the first state, conditioned on reaching a state belonging to this set, is:
(1−p1)q 1 . Similarly, the conditional probability of being in the second state equals: 2p1q 2 .
q 1+p1(2−3q 1) q 1+p1(2−3q 1)
Lastly, the conditional probability of being in the third state is: 2p1(1−q 1−q 2).
q 1+p1(2−3q 1)
Equilibrium analysis. In all states belonging to this set, abstention results in a utility of −1
for the F type voter. The utility of voting varies among the states. In case the uninformed voter
abstains, then voting results in a utility of −c. If the uninformed votes late, the utility from voting
is −1−c. Finally, if the uninformed votes early, then the utility equals −c if the A type voter did
not vote, and equals −1 − c if it has voted. Due to symmetry, A voters vote in this state with
probability p .
2,⟨1,0⟩
Thus, in a sequentially rational equilibrium, F voters are indifferent if the expected utility of
voting equals that of abstaining, given the voter’s beliefs. In Eq. (5), we derive the corresponding
indifference condition.
q
(1−p )· 1 ·(((1−p )·(−c))+(p ·(−1−c)))
1 2 2,⟨1,0⟩ 2,⟨1,0⟩
+(p ·q ·(−1−c))+(p ·(1−q −q )·(−c))
1 2 1 1 2
q
= (1−p )· 1 ·(−1)+(p ·q ·(−1))
1 2 1 2
+(p ·(1−q −q )·(−1)) (5)
1 1 2
23We solve Eq. (5) for c, giving us: c = 1+ (p 2,⟨1,0⟩q 1−2q 2)p1−p 2,⟨1,0⟩q 1. Moreover, we deduce from
(2−3q 1)p1+q
1
Eq. (5) that for any cost above this value, the expected utility of abstaining is greater than that of
voting, while for lower values, the opposite holds. As before, this insight allows us to present the
equilibrium strategy as following a “threshold” structure in Proposition 3.2.
Proposition 3.3. Given that the F type voter did not vote early and a state with interim tally equal
to ⟨1,0⟩ is reached, the equilibrium strategy is:

1, ((q > 0)∧(c < p ))
  1 2,⟨0,1⟩
p = 0, ((q > 0)∧(c > p ))
2,⟨1,0⟩ 1 2,⟨0,1⟩

indifference, ((q > 0)∧(c = p ))∨(q = 0)
1 2,⟨0,1⟩ 1
Proof. Similarly to the analysis of the preceding information sets, we go over the states comprising
this set, the beliefs of agents upon reaching such a state, and agents’ equilibrium strategies.
States. This information set corresponds to a single state, where the uninformed voted early for F,
and none of the informed voters voted in the first round.
Beliefs. This state is reachable only if there is both some probability that an uninformed vote
will be cast early (q > 0), and a non-zero probability of informed voters waiting in the first round
1
(p < 1). From the perspective of the F type voter, this information set contains just a single state:
1
as this voter did not vote in the first round, and is the only informed voter favoring F, reaching this
state implies that the uninformed voter cast F. For the A voter, this state is indistinguishable from
all other states where the interim results correspond to a single vote for F, i.e., when reaching this
state, the A voter’s information set is symmetric to the green information set.
Equilibriumanalysis. Giventhisstateisreached,theFtypevotercanvotetoassureitspreference
will win whether the A type voter turns out or not, thereby receiving a utility of 1−c. Conversely,
consider the case where the F type voter abstains. In a symmetric sequentially rational equilibrium,
the A type voter abstains as well with probability 1−p , resulting in a win for F and a utility
2,⟨0,1⟩
of 1. With the complementary probability p , the A type informed voter casts a vote, in which
2,⟨0,1⟩
case the winner is chosen at random and the expected utility is 0. Thus, the indifference condition
for the F voter is: 1−c = (cid:0) 1−p (cid:1) ·1+p ·0, which can be simplified to p = c.
2,⟨0,1⟩ 2,⟨0,1⟩ 2,⟨0,1⟩
Similarly to before, our result implies that the equilibrium strategy has a cost threshold; i.e.,
if c > p then abstaining dominates, while for lower costs, voters would prefer to vote. We
2,⟨0,1⟩
provide the threshold strategy in the statement of Proposition 3.3.
Proposition 4.1. The utility gained from voting early is:
UF = (1−p )·(1−q +(1−q −q )·p )−c
vote,t1 1 1 1 2 2,⟨0,1⟩
Proof. The expected utility is composed of contributions from the relevant and mutually exclusive
branches of the game tree. We replace the lower indexes of each contribution term with a corre-
sponding interim tally and the distribution q to explicitly specify those branches. If the informed
F-type voter votes early, the following interim tallies contribute to the expected utility: ⟨2,0⟩, ⟨1,1⟩,

Proof. First, we note that the indifference condition for this case is UF −UF = 0. We

solve Corollary 4.3 under this constraint for p , reaching the stated result.

Theorem 4.10. When q > 0, there exist equilibria strategy profiles where q ∈ (0,1).

Proof. RecallthatwehaveshowninProposition3.2thatvotersareindifferenttothevalueofp
2,⟨0,1⟩
when c = 1+ (p 2,⟨1,0⟩q 1−2q 2)p1−p 2,⟨1,0⟩q 1. We solve this for p , and obtain:

Furthermore, in Proposition 3.3 we prove that when q > 0 and c = p , then voters are
1 2,⟨0,1⟩
indifferentw.r.t. p . WesubstitutetheseinCorollary4.4, andnotethatthesetwosubstitutions
2,⟨1,0⟩
can co-exist as Proposition 3.2 specifies that in our case, voters are indifferent to p . After some

arithmetic, we arrive at the following form for p :

Note that the above form is only dependent on p , and our exogenous parameters c,q ,q . To
2,⟨0,0⟩ 1 2
obtain our result, we need to ensure that our expressions for both p and p are feasible. Thus,
2,⟨1,0⟩ 1
we require that p ∈ [0,1] and that p ∈ (0,1) (as we are seeking fully mixed equilibria):

By intersecting these parameter ranges, it becomes apparent that the intersection is non-empty for
certain parameter regimes. In particular, one possible parameter set is c = 1, q = 43, q = 169,

p = 0. In both cases, voters are indifferent w.r.t. p . When q = 0, q = 0 and for c = 1−q ,

we have that p = 1 and voters are indifferent w.r.t. p , while for c = 1− 2, we again have

p = 1 and that voters are indifferent w.r.t. p . In all cases, voters are indifferent w.r.t. p .
1 2,⟨0,0⟩ 2,⟨1,0⟩
Proof. We start with Proposition 4.5, which reasons about second-turn strategies when q = 0.

Proposition 4.5. When q = 0, second turn strategy profiles are determined solely according to
1
the exogenous parameters c and⃗q. Moreover, we have that voters are indifferent w.r.t. p , and

that:

The proof of Proposition 4.5 is given in Appendix A. We continue by substituting q = 0 in

Corollary 4.3 to obtain the difference in utility between voting early and late in the current case,
and get:

2,⟨0,0⟩ 2,⟨0,0⟩ 2,⟨0,1⟩ 1 2 2,⟨0,1⟩
Note that Eq. (24) implies that voting early dominates waiting when p = p :
2,⟨0,1⟩ 2,⟨0,0⟩
• When p = 1 = p , the difference in utility is q , implying that later uninformed
2,⟨0,1⟩ 2,⟨0,0⟩ 2
arrivals contribute to the informed voters’ decision to vote early.
• When p = 0 = p , the difference in utility equals 1−c, which is strictly positive as
2,⟨0,1⟩ 2,⟨0,0⟩
c ∈ [0,1). Furthermore, the utility is obviously monotonically increasing in c.
29We now attempt to analyze cases where voters are indifferent between voting early and late. Thus,
we substitute q = 0 in Corollary 4.4, :
1
(1−p )c+(1−q )p −1
p = 2,⟨0,0⟩ 2 2,⟨0,1⟩ (25)
1
(p −p )c
2,⟨0,1⟩ 2,⟨0,0⟩
Given q and c, we can use Eq. (26) to derive equilibria values for p and p . These, in
2 2,⟨0,1⟩ 2,⟨0,0⟩
turn, can be substituted in Eq. (25) to obtain equilibria values for p . Having ruled out the cases
1
where p = p , we turn to substitute p = 1 and p = 0 in Eq. (25), and receive
2,⟨0,0⟩ 2,⟨0,1⟩ 2,⟨0,0⟩ 2,⟨0,1⟩
p = 1. But, Proposition 4.5 shows that these values are only for c ∈ (cid:0) 1−q ,1− q 2(cid:1), implying
1 c 2 2
that 1 > 1, which is not feasible. Note that substituting p = 1 and p = 0 into the
c 2,⟨0,0⟩ 2,⟨0,1⟩
utility difference formula results in a utility of 1, implying that voting dominates. The proof of
Proposition 4.5 gives us two additional cases to examine. The first is when c = 1−q , p = 1
2 2,⟨0,0⟩
and voters are indifferent w.r.t. p , allowing us to get: p = p 2,⟨0,1⟩(q 2−1)+1 . By requiring that
2,⟨0,1⟩ 1 (p −1)(q −1)
2,⟨0,1⟩ 2
q ≤ 1 and solving the resulting equation: p 2,⟨0,1⟩(q 2−1)+1 ≤ 1, one can see that the condition is
1 (p −1)(q −1)
2,⟨0,1⟩ 2
satisfied only for q = 0, and even then we get that q = 1. The second and final case is when voters
2 1
are indifferent w.r.t. p , p = 0 and c = 1− q 2, which imply p = 1− q 2 , but
2,⟨0,0⟩ 2,⟨0,1⟩ 2 1 p (q −2)
2,⟨0,0⟩ 2
again we reach a degenerate case that is only feasible when q = 0, and which implies p = 1.
2 1
Proposition 4.5. When q = 0, second turn strategy profiles are determined solely according to
1
the exogenous parameters c and⃗q. Moreover, we have that voters are indifferent w.r.t. p , and
2,⟨1,0⟩
that:
  q
1, c < 1−q 1, c < 1− 2
  2   2

2,⟨0,1⟩ 2 2,⟨0,0⟩ 2
 indifference, c = 1−q  indifference, c = 1− q 2
2 2
Proof. Propositions 3.1 to 3.3 show that equilibrium strategies may vary in different regions of our
parameter space (i.e., c and ⃗q). In particular, Proposition 3.1 shows that the values assigned in
equilibria to p depend solely on our exogenous parameters for the entire parameter space. On
2,⟨0,0⟩
the other hand, Proposition 3.3 shows that this is true only when q = 0 for p , in which case
1 2,⟨1,0⟩
voters are indifferent to the value of p . This is because when q = 0, uninformed voters do not
2,⟨1,0⟩ 1
vote early, implying that the information set that p applies to does not exist. This extends to
2,⟨1,0⟩
p and p , as well; by substituting q = 0 in Propositions 3.1 and 3.2, we reach:
2,⟨0,1⟩ 2,⟨0,0⟩ 1
  q
1, c < 1−q 1, c < 1− 2
  2   2

2,⟨0,1⟩ 2 2,⟨0,0⟩ 2
 indifference, c = 1−q  indifference, c = 1− q 2
2 2
We turn to characterize the feasible combinations for p and p by using Eq. (26).
2,⟨0,0⟩ 2,⟨0,1⟩
1. If voters are indifferent w.r.t. both p and p , then c = 1−q = 1− q 2, but that is
2,⟨0,1⟩ 2,⟨0,0⟩ 2 2
possible only when q = 0. Moreover, this implies that c = 1, which is outside our feasible
2
parameter range, thereby ruling-out this possibility.
2. Ifvotersarebothindifferentw.r.t. p andp = 0,thenthisimpliesc = 1−q > 1−q 2,
2,⟨0,1⟩ 2,⟨0,0⟩ 2 2
which in turn implies q < 0, which cannot be as q is a probability.
2 2
3. If voters are indifferent w.r.t. p and p = 1, then by combining the constraints for
2,⟨0,1⟩ 2,⟨0,0⟩
both, we get c = 1−q < 1− q 2, implying that this can only hold when 0 < q .
2 2 2
304. If p = 0 and voters are indifferent w.r.t. p , then 1− q 2 = c > 1−q , therefore the
2,⟨0,1⟩ 2,⟨0,0⟩ 2 2
current condition can only be satisfied when q > 0.

be written succinctly: c > 1− q 2.

case can be abbreviated to: c < 1−q . For c to be feasible, we must also require that q < 1.

Theorem 4.7. If q > 0, there are feasible parameter regimes where waiting dominates voting
1
early. Moreover, equilibria strategy profiles have: p = 0, p = c and p = 1 − c, while
1 2,⟨0,1⟩ 2,⟨1,0⟩
the value of p varies according to the parameter regime, where p = 0 in the high cost
2,⟨0,0⟩ 2,⟨0,0⟩
regime (characterized in Proposition 4.8), and p = 1 in the low cost regime (characterized in
2,⟨0,0⟩
Proposition 4.9).
Proof. We prove this result by ruling out almost all strategies for the current case in Proposi-
tion A.1. Then, we prove that there are feasible parameter regimes which admit such equilibria,
and characterize the equilibria strategies for each region of our parameter space.
Notably, Proposition A.1 implies that in the current case, voters exhibit a “free-rider” mentality
that is dependent on the cost of voting: if c is high, then voters assign a low probability of voting,
even when the interim tally shows their preference is the leading candidate.
Proposition A.1. In an equilibrium strategy profile where waiting dominates voting early, if q > 0,
1
then p = 0, p = c and p = 1−c.
1 2,⟨0,1⟩ 2,⟨1,0⟩
Proof. Given the current assumption that waiting dominates early voting, we analyze all possible
strategies for the case where q > 0, as given by Eq. (28) and Propositions 3.1 and 3.3. We show
1
that the conditions implied by for all but one strategy allow us to reach contradictions.
Our assumption that waiting dominates early voting implies p = 0, and that UF −

UF < 0. By substituting both into Corollary 4.3, we can constrain the feasible voting strate-

Furthermore, substituting p = 0 into Proposition 3.2 allows to simplify p :

2,⟨1,0⟩
Armed with Eqs. (27) and (28), we tackle each possible strategy.
311. If p = 1 and p = 1 dominate, then by Proposition 3.3 we get that c < p = 1, and
2,⟨0,1⟩ 2,⟨1,0⟩ 2,⟨0,1⟩
similarly from Eq. (28) we obtain that c < 1−p = 0. Both imply that setting p = 1
2,⟨1,0⟩ 2,⟨0,1⟩
and p = 1 is only rational when c < 0, but this is outside our feasible parameter range.
2,⟨1,0⟩
2. If p = 1 and p = 0 dominate, then Proposition 3.3 and Eq. (28) correspondingly tell
2,⟨0,1⟩ 2,⟨1,0⟩
us that c > p = 1 and 1 = 1−p > c, implying a contradiction: 1 > c > 1.
2,⟨0,1⟩ 2,⟨1,0⟩
3. If p = 1 dominates and voters are indifferent w.r.t. p , then as before, we use Proposi-
2,⟨0,1⟩ 2,⟨1,0⟩
tion 3.3 and Eq. (28) to reach a contradiction: 1 = p = c < 1−p ≤ 1.
2,⟨0,1⟩ 2,⟨1,0⟩
4. If p = 0 and p = 1 dominate, then Proposition 3.3 and Eq. (28) allow us to arrive at
2,⟨0,1⟩ 2,⟨1,0⟩
a contradiction: 0 = 1−p < c < p = 0.
2,⟨1,0⟩ 2,⟨0,1⟩
5. If p = 0 and p = 0 dominate, then from Eq. (28), we deduce that c > 1−p = 1,
2,⟨0,1⟩ 2,⟨1,0⟩ 2,⟨1,0⟩
which is outside our feasible region for costs.
6. Ifp = 0dominatesandvotersareindifferentw.r.t. p ,thenProposition3.3andEq.(28)
2,⟨0,1⟩ 2,⟨1,0⟩
imply: 0 = p = c < 1−p . Substituting this in Eq. (27) gives us:
2,⟨0,1⟩ 2,⟨1,0⟩
c

But, because q ∈ [0,1], we reach a contradiction: 0 > 1−q ≥ 0.

2,⟨0,1⟩ 2,⟨0,1⟩ 2,⟨1,0⟩
8. If voters are indifferent w.r.t. p and p = 0 dominates, then Eq. (28) implies c =

1−p = 1, which is outside the feasible regime for c.
2,⟨1,0⟩
9. If voters are indifferent w.r.t. to both p and p , then we get from Proposition 3.3
2,⟨0,1⟩ 2,⟨1,0⟩
and Eq. (28) that p = c = 1−p . Thus, we deduce that p = c and p = 1−c.
2,⟨0,1⟩ 2,⟨1,0⟩ 2,⟨0,1⟩ 2,⟨1,0⟩
In total, the only feasible strategy is the one in which p = c and p = 1−c.

Given this new constraint, we analyze each option given by Proposition 3.1 for p , and char-

Proof. According to Proposition 3.1, our choice of p imposes two conditions: q < 1 and

c > 1+ q 2 = 2q 1+q 2−2. Wesubstitutep = 0inEq.(29),andget: c(1.5q +q −2) < q −1.

This implies that: c > q 1−1 , where the direction of the inequality was flipped because both
1.5q +q −2
1 2
q +q ≤ 1 and q < 1, allowing us to deduce: 1.5q +q −2 ≤ −1. Together with the condition
1 2 1 1 2 2
(cid:16) (cid:16) (cid:17) (cid:17)
imposed by Proposition 3.1, we get: c ∈ max q 1−1 , 2q 1+q 2−2 ,1 .
1.5q +q −2 2(q −1)
1 2 1
This range is non-empty when either q 1−1 ≤ 2q 1+q 2−2 < 1, or 2q 1+q 2−2 ≤ q 1−1 < 1.

1 2 1 1 1 2
First, examine the case where: q 1−1 < 1. This requirement is equivalent to q − 1 >
1.5q +q −2 1
1 2
1.5q +q −2, where the direction of the inequality is flipped as 1.5q +q −2 ≤ −1 < 0. This
1 2 1 2 2
requirement implies that 1 > 0.5q +q , which is indeed true: by definition q +q ≤ 1, and in the
1 2 1 2
current case we furthermore have q > 0.
1
In the other case, we have the following condition: 2q 1+q 2−2 < 1. When multiplying both sides
2(q −1)
1
of by q −1, we flip the direction of the inequality due to our assumption that q ∈ (0,1), giving
1 1
us: 2q +q −2 > 2(q −1). This implies that: q > 0.
1 2 1 2
Due to the asymmetry between the feasible q values for the two cases, we characterize in
2
Propositions A.2 and A.3 the regimes for which each one is satisfied. Note that these results are
slightly more general as they are reused for additional proofs. In particular, Proposition A.2 does
not impose the restriction q > 0, which is instead accounted for only afterward.

Proofs for both results are given in Appendix A. Intuitively, we use the various requirements to
constrain our parameter space, resulting in systems of several equations which we solve. By using
them, we fully characterize when q 1−1 < 2q 1+q 2−2 holds (via Proposition A.2), and similarly,
1.5q +q −2 2(q −1)

where we have q 1−1 ≥ 2q 1+q 2−2 (via Proposition A.3).

Next, we accou1nt 2for the con1straints which were left out of the aforementioned two results, to
ensure their generality. In particular, we have to consider that q +q ∈ [0,1], and also consider
1 2
the requirement of the current case that q ∈ (0,1). For the former constraint, one can verify
1
using the extreme values of our range for q and the resulting ranges for q that the range of
(cid:18) √ (cid:19) 2 1
values q ∈ 3−3.5q 2+ 8.25q2 2−5q 2+1 ,1 is infeasible. Furthermore, for the latter constraint, one can
1 2
account for it by intersecting it with our resulting parameter regions. Finally, the characterization
stated in Proposition 4.8 is obtained.

For Eq. (37), the proof of Proposition A.2 shows it is satisfied when q ∈ (cid:2)1,1(cid:3). The condition

given in Eq. (36) is satisfied when q ∈ (cid:2) 0, 3 (cid:3) due to the strict positivity of the left-hand side, as

For Eq. (39), from the proof of Proposition A.2 we get that the condition holds for q ≤ 2− 2.

The constraint given in Eq. (40) is always satisfied when q ≥ 1 due to Eq. (30). With respect
2 3.5
to q < 1 , both sides are positive, allowing us to raise them to the power of two, and solve the
2 3.5
resulting inequality:
0 ≤ 8.25q2−5q +1−(1−3.5q )2

This holds for q ∈ (cid:2) 0, 1(cid:3). As Eq. (40) holds for q ≥ 1 and 1 < 1, thus we have q ∈ [0,1].

In total, note that Eq. (33) is satisfied only when both Eqs. (39) and (40) are satisfied. By

intersecting their feasible value ranges, we find that Eq. (33) holds for q ∈ (cid:2) 0,2− 2(cid:3).

Satisfying Eq. (35). The condition given in Eq. (35) is equivalent to requiring that both:
(cid:113)
8.25q2−5q +1 ≥ 3−3.5q (41)
2 2 2
(cid:113)
8.25q2−5q +1 ≥ 3.5q −1 (42)
2 2 2
The condition of Eq. (41) holds for q ≥ 3 , due to Eq. (30). For q < 3 , reasoning similar to that

given in the proof of Proposition A.2 shows that it is satisfied for q ∈ (cid:2) 2− 2,2+ 2(cid:3). When
2 √
combined with the previous results, we deduce that the condition holds for q ∈ (cid:2) 2− 2,1(cid:3). With
2
respect to Eq. (42), again one can deduce from Eq. (30) that it is satisfied for q ≤ 1 , while the
2 3.5
proof of Proposition A.2 shows that the condition holds for q ∈ (cid:2) 0, 1(cid:3). In total, observe that the

intersection of the feasible parameters for Eqs. (41) and (42) is empty.
Feasible parameters for q . Finally, recall that the range Eq. (32) includes feasible q values

when either one of Eqs. (33) to (35) is satisfied. Note that 0.58 ≈ 2− 2 > 0.5, thus we get that
Eq. (32) is non-empty for q ∈ [0,1]. This implies that q 1−1 ≥ 2q 1+q 2−2 is satisfied when:

1+ q 2 and q < 1. By substituting p = 1 in Eq. (29), we get (cid:0)q 1 +q −1(cid:1) c+1−q < 0,
2(q −1) 1 2,⟨0,0⟩ 2 2 1
which 1 we rearrange to: 1−q < (cid:0) 1− q 1 −q (cid:1) c. Dividing the expression by 1− q 1 −q does not
1 2 2 2 2
change the inequality’s direction, as q +q ∈ [0,1] and as in the current case we have q > 0. Thus,
1 2 1
we deduce that 1− q 1 −q > 0, and get a constraint on c: 1−q 1 < c. To satisfy both the new
2 2 1−q1−q

For clarity, note that 14−4 2 ≈ 0.2, 14+4 2 ≈ 0.48. Thus, our parameter range is currently: q ∈

The former is equivalent to (cid:112) 41q2−28q +4 ≤ 5q +2, and thus is satisfied for q ∈ [0,3]:

For Eq. (48), it is equivalent to (cid:112) 41q2−28q +4 > 5q −2, which is trivially satisfied when both

as 0.2 ≈ 14−4 2 < 2. In case q ≥ 2, both sides of the constraint are positive, thus we can raise

In total, we get that the constraint holds when q ∈ 0, 14−4 2 ∪(cid:0)1,1(cid:3).

Satisfying Eq. (45). This requirement is equivalent to satisfying both Eqs. (49) and (50):

which does not hold for q > 0.2. For q ≤ 0.2, we raise the inequality to the power of two and

B Additional Related Work
In this section, we go over additional related papers. As we noted before, the reliance of on-chain
governance protocolson tokenstorepresentvotingpowerbears asimilarityto corporategovernance
mechanismswhichgivevotingpowerpershare. Thus,wealsogooverworksoncorporategovernance
which could interest the blockchain community.
39B.1 Blockchain Governance
Theoretical Studies. Kiayias and Lazos [KL22] present a systemization of knowledge (SoK) of
blockchain governance mechanisms. In the paper, governance is defined in the broad sense, taken to
mean both the mechanism by which improvements are suggested and adopted by cryptocurrencies
like Bitcoin, and the on-chain protocols employed by decentralized finance (DeFi) projects. In the
paper, several properties of interest are defined, such as who is granted suffrage by each mechanism,
and the confidentiality of the voting process, and quantitatively evaluate the various mechanisms.
Wright [Wri19] suggest using Posner and Weyl’s [PW14] quadratic voting in blockchains. In
such voting mechanisms, the voting power of an individual is equal to the square root of the
number of votes it casts. Dimitri [Dim22] analyze a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism
whichreliesonquadraticvoting,andnoteitisnotSybilresistant: voterscangainadisproportionate
advantage by splitting their votes across multiple identities. Indeed, similar mechanisms are in use
inpractice[Tea22]. Somepractitioners[Rod22]recommendimprovingSybil-resistancebyrandomly
choosing the subset of eligible voters for each proposal. We note that adversaries can circumvent
this measure by splitting their funds into multiple accounts in advance.
Empirical Studies. Fritsch et al. [FM+22b] study the distribution of voting power and the degree
of decentralization of the governance mechanisms used by Compound, Uniswap and ENS. This
was done by evaluating various measures, such as the Gini coefficient [YS13] of token holders,
and the frequency with which single voters have influenced decisions. The authors found that the
surveyed protocols became more decentralized with time, and that a small number of voters hold a
considerable amount of voting power, but that they do not exercise it often.
Feichtingeretal.[FF+23]laterextendedthestudyof[FM+22b]usingthesamemetrics,butwith
more recent data spanning a larger amount of governance protocols. They show that governance
mechanisms are in fact still relatively centralized, with majority power concentrated in the hands
of few users in 17 mechanisms out of the total of 21 which were examined. These results are sup-
plemented by an analysis of the costs associated with governance protocols, which are estimated at
over$10Million. Theyconsiderbothcostsdirectlyrelatedtoparticipationindecision-making(e.g.,
paying fees for voting transactions), and indirect ones (costs paid due to the overhead of updating
governance-related data structures when performing unrelated actions, like token transfers).
Fan et al. [FM+22a] use the case of Uniswap and SushiSwap as a natural experiment to measure
howgovernancetokenissuanceincentivizesthemigrationofusersbetweentwocompetingplatforms.
In particular, SushiSwap was created as a fork of Uniswap, and thus by design both are identical,
with the exception that SushiSwap rewarded liquidity providers with governance tokens, while
Uniswap did not. The authors note that although SushiSwap’s policy quickly attracted liquidity
providers, some of these providers tended to remove their liquidity a few days afterwards, especially
ones who provide large amounts of liquidity.
Barbereauet al.[BS+22a]quantifythecentralizationofthegovernancemechanismsofUniswap,

strategies, the authors found that only SushiSwap and Yearn Finance adopted “fair” strategies that
do not involve some preliminary issuance of tokens by the projects’ creators and then selling it to
users. Theynotethatafairstrategycouldbetothedetrimentofaproject,andgivethecaseofYearn

party security audit. The paper proceeds with an empirical evaluation of the distribution of tokens
among users through the lens of various metrics, such as the Gini coefficient, and the distributions’
similarity to a “good” distribution that represents an ideal level of decentralization [GS+20].
40Barbereau et al. [BS+22b] expand the study of [BS+22a] by analyzing user participation in the
surveyed mechanisms, and including additional mechanisms in their analysis, specifically 0x, Aave,
Compound and Uniswap. They found that typically, the rate of participation is low, only rarely
rising above a turnout of 1%. The authors ascribe the low rate to the ability of users to trade them,
and justify this conclusion by showing that until January 2022, the trading volume of governance
tokens is much higher when compared to the amount of tokens which are delegated.
Sunet al.[SS+22]attempttoquantifythelevelofcentralizationinMaker’sgovernanceprotocol,
usingdataspanningAugust2019andOctober2021,andbyapplyingmetricslikevoterparticipation
and Twitter sentiment. The authors find that the average and median share of votes cast by the
largest voter per proposal were 52.66% and 48.35%, respectively. Furthermore, they examine the
financial impact of centralization. They conduct regression analyses and show that Maker’s trading
volume and the number of transactions interacting with the platform are positively correlated with
the share of users in possession of 10−100K MKR tokens, and negatively correlated with the share
of those who hold more than 100K tokens.
Sharma et al. [SK+23] conducted a mixed-methods study to evaluate the effectiveness of gov-
ernance mechanisms employed by 10 decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs): Compound,
BitDAO, AssangeDAO, BanklessDAO, KrauseHouse, LivePeer, MetaGammaDelta, MolochDAO,
dxDAO. For their work, they interviewed 10 participants of such mechanisms, and used responses
to identify decentralization metrics which are considered as relevant by the community, primarily,
the distribution of token ownership, token holders’ participation rate in the governance process,
and the geographic distribution of holders. By these metrics, the authors find that Compound,
AssangeDAO, Bankless and Krausehouse fare poorly with respect to decentralization, and show
that across all examined platforms, proposal success is positively correlated with the token holdings
of the proposer, and that repeated participation in votes is positively correlated with a voter’s hold-
ings. Morevoer, the work examines the technical aspects of governance mechanisms, and shows that
some are limited in that they do not allow successful proposals to execute arbitrary transactions,
while others rely on third-party services to fulfil proposals.
Dotanetal.[DY+23]performaseriesofcase-studiesonvulnerabitiliesofgovernancemechanisms
andhowthesewereexploited. Forexample,theauthorsshowthatCompound’smechanismawarded
users with governance tokens for taking loans, where the reward mechanism resulted in the interest-
rate of the corresponding loans to be negative. The case studies are augmented by a data-driven
analysis showing that voter turnout is negatively correlated with transaction fees, and that on some
occasions, voters possessed governance tokens for the span of a single voting window.
Kitzler et al. [KB+23] study so-called DAO “contributors”, such as DAO owners and developers.
Theyfindthatcontributorspossesthemajorityofvotingpowerin7.5%oftheexaminedgovernance
mechanisms, and have decided at least a single proposal in 20.4% of them. The authors uncover
systemic evidence in support of Dotan et al. [DY+23], showing that in 14.8% of the examined
governance proposals, the volume of trades of governance tokens made in the 100 days preceding
each proposal exceeded the amount of votes required to obtain a majority in the corresponding
proposal.
B.2 Corporate Governance
Theoretical Studies. Cvijanovic et al. [CG+20] propose a theoretical model that captures the
“free-rider effect”, wherein voters who have popular preferences are less inclined to vote. The work
showsthatthereisanequilibriumwhereall“underdog” votersvoteandothervotersonlyparticipate
partially.
Dekel and Wolinsky [DW11] study the efficiency of the outcome of corporate control contests
41when allowing voting rights to be traded separately of shares, where an outcome was considered
efficient if the actor that wins control of the corporation is the one that maximizes shareholder
value. The authors show that allowing vote trading always results in inefficient outcomes, and note
that this contrasts with the intuition that in the political setting vote buying should be considered
deterimental, while in the corporate setting it should enhance efficiency.
AmethodforassessingthevalueofshareholdervotingrightswasgivenbyKalayet al.[KK+14].
Their method compares the price of a share to a “synthesized” non-voting share, with the latter
being constructed using put-call parity. The method is then employed on real-world data, showing
that the value of voting rights increases around special shareholder meetings and when voting on
contentious mergers and acquisitions.
Empirical Studies. Brav et al. [BC+22] conduct an study on retail shareholder voting, finding
that turnout is higher for voters with larger holdings or when the expected benefits from voting
are high, while turnout decreases when the cost of participation is high. An analysis of shareholder
voting in 17 European countries between the years 2005 and 2010 was carried out by Renneboog
and Szilagyi [RS13]. The authors found that turnout by owners of free-float shares (that is, shares
that can be publicly traded) was relatively low: 17% in France, 10% in Germany, and 4% in Italy.
Furthermore, the authors note that shareholder proposals (proposals written by shareholders rather
than by the management of a corporation) were mostly raised by shareholders of large and poorly
performing corporations. Additionally, dissenting votes were more frequent when the proposals
advancedtheadoptionofanti-takeoverdevicesandexecutivecompensation. Ahigherrateofdissent
in proposals on remuneration was also found by Hewitt [Hew11], who studied OECD countries.
Li and Schwartz-Ziv [LS18] show that the daily volume, number of trades and the volatility of
shares are increased around shareholder voting dates, particularly when the votes are considered
important and when voting culminated in a dissenting outcome. A similar finding that share prices
decline after voting is given by Fos and Holderness [FH22]. Additionally, the work presents data
showing that corporations sometimes reveal voting dates after the fact, thereby preventing stock-
holders from exercising their right to vote. We note that commonly used governance mechanisms
do not allow such paractices, as proposals are announced publicly on the blockchain.
Shareholder Value Maximization (SVM).Shareholder value maximization (SVM) isabusiness
goal which can be broadly defined as striving to increase the wealth of the business’ shareholders.
Sundaram and Inkpen [SI04] propose SVM as the “preferred” goal for corporate finance, arguing
it is ethical and easily measurable. Freeman et al. [FW+04] criticize SVM as it only focuses on
shareholders and ignores corporate stakeholders, with the latter taken to mean any actor who can
affect or be affected by the corporation. Thus, shareholders are stakeholders, but not necessarily
the other way around. For example, employees of the corporation are stakeholders, even if they
do not possess any shares. Inkpen and Sundaram [IS22] discuss the relevance of SVM in the face
of academic criticism and later developments in the corporate finance world, such as the supposed
greater divergence in shareholder interests in recent years [GR22].
