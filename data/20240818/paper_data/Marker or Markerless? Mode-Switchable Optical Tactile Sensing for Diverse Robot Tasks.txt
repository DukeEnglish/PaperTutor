Marker or Markerless? Mode-Switchable Optical Tactile Sensing for
Diverse Robot Tasks
Ni Ou1,2,†, Zhuo Chen2 and Shan Luo2
Abstract—Optical tactile sensors play a pivotal role in robot Marker Markerless
perception and manipulation tasks. The membrane of these sen-
sorscanbepaintedwithmarkersorremainmarkerless,enabling
themtofunctionineithermarkerormarkerlessmode.However,
this uni-modal selection means the sensor is only suitable for
eithermanipulationorperceptiontasks.Whilemarkersarevital
for manipulation, they can also obstruct the camera, thereby
impeding perception. The dilemma of selecting between marker
andmarkerlessmodespresentsasignificantobstacle.Toaddress
this issue, we propose a novel mode-switchable optical tactile
sensing approach that facilitates transitions between the two Markerless Marker
modes. The marker-to-markerless transition is achieved through
agenerativemodel,whereasitsinversetransitionisrealizedusing
a sparsely supervised regressive model. Our approach allows a
single-mode optical sensor to operate effectively in both marker
andmarkerlessmodeswithouttheneedforadditionalhardware,
makingitwell-suitedforbothperceptionandmanipulationtasks.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method.
For perception tasks, our approach decreases the number of
