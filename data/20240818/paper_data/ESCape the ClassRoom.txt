Quest , allowing educators to share the experiences they create
while bypassing the need for additional software installations on
devices. This paper will present the design and implementation of
ESCape the Classroom, and discuss the potential for this platform
to be used in educational settings.
1 INTRODUCTION
Escape rooms, known for their enigmatic puzzles and thrilling time constraints,
have soared in popularity as a form of entertainment. When designed with ed-
ucational purposes in mind, these escape rooms can align game elements with
specific learning objectives, creating an engaging and dynamic educational tool.

and maintain (Fotaris and Mastoras, ). Digital versions, on the other hand,
have generally lacked physical immersion due to their reliance on online forms
2022
(Antón-Solanas et al., ). Furthermore, both physical and digital escape rooms
require significant time and effort to design, particularly for educators without
2023
game design expertise (Fotaris, Mastoras, and Lameras, ).
Virtual reality (VR) offers a promising alternative. Games such as "Among Us VR"
and "Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes" illustrate the potential for engaging
puzzle games within VR environments, benefiting from VR’s unique features like
2021
player-controlled cameras (Nyyssönen and Smed, ). However, these games
typically involve simple, non-educational puzzles and do not support the creation
of customizable learning scenarios due to their closed-source nature.
This gap underscores the need for a VR-based educational escape room platform
that replicates the immersive experience of physical rooms and supports the de-
velopment of educational content without the associated high costs. Advances in
immersive Mixed Reality (XR) technologies and the availability of affordable XR
3
headsets,suchastheMetaQuest ,aremakingsuchimmersiveexperiencesincreas-
ingly feasible and accessible in educational settings. Additionally, the integration
of Large Language Models in the design and evaluation phases of educational
escape rooms has been explored, showing potential for these models to enhance
formative assessments, provide personalized feedback to learners (Pinto et al.,
2023 2023
), and speed up the design process (Nye, Mee, and Core, ).
2 THENEEDFORVIRTUALREALITYINEDUCATIONALESCAPEROOMS
Educational Escape Rooms (EERs) have proven to be a dynamic tool for engag-
ing learners by incorporating immersive storytelling and the practical applica-
2021
tion of abstract concepts (López-Pernas et al., ). Traditional physical escape
rooms excel in providing this immersive experience, creating a sense of presence
2019
that is both engaging and memorable(Lopez-Pernas et al., ). However, the
construction of these physical spaces demands considerable resources, including
2022
time, money, and physical materials(Fotaris and Mastoras, ), which can be
prohibitive. Additionally, while digital escape rooms have been developed as an
2022
alternative (Antón-Solanas et al., ), many of these offerings are delivered as
forms or quizzes, which lacks the depth of immersion that makes physical escape
2024
rooms so compelling (Quek et al., ).
2This gap in digital escape room design—where the physical sensations and real-
time interactions that make traditional escape rooms profoundly engaging are
absent—highlights a significant opportunity within educational technology. Vir-
tual Reality (VR) emerges as a compelling solution to this problem. VR uniquely
allows the creation of spatially navigable environments that users can interact
with in a manner that closely mirrors real-world interactions (Chukusol, Nilsook,
2022
and Wannapiroon, ). This technology can simulate the immersive aspects of
physicalrooms,includingtheabilitytoexplore,manipulateobjects,andsolvepuz-
zles in a seemingly tangible world, all without the associated logistical constraints
and overheads.
Furthermore, VR technology has reached a level of maturity and accessibility
that makes it a practical option for educational settings (Wohlgenannt, Simons,
2020 3
and Stieglitz, ). The latest VR hardware, such as the Meta Quest , offers
high-quality immersive experiences at a price point that is becoming increasingly
feasible for educational institutions. These devices are also becoming easier to use,
with intuitive interfaces that both educators and students can navigate without
2021
prior experience in virtual environments (Kao, Magana, and Mousas, ).
The potential of VR to bridge the engagement gap in digital educational escape
rooms is partially supported by research (Shute, ) indicating that immersive VR
environments can potentially enhance learning outcomes (Gordon,Trovinger,and
2019
DeLellis, ). Studies have shown that VR can improve retention rates in some
2016
cases(Smithetal., ).Ifeducatorscancreatecompelling,immersiveeducational

scalable and cost-conscious way. These escape rooms can be iteratively adapted to
meet diverse educational needs without substantial ongoing costs.
3 ESCAPE THE CLASSROOM FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW
The "ESCape the Classroom" framework integrates several technologies and cus-
tom components to create immersive and interactive virtual reality educational
escape rooms (VR EERs).
3.1 Game State Management
This framework uses X-State JS and and a custom game-state AFrame component
to manage game states effectively. It dynamically adds rooms and puzzles to the
state machine by defining game states as entities and attaching the game-state
3component to those entities. This is done by adding the <a-entity> tag for the
puzzle in the HTML file and adding the component as an attribute to that entity.
<a-entity id="puzzle1"
game-state="type:puzzle; name:puzzle1; room:room1"></a-entity>
Other components can listen for game-state-event events from the VR scene to
facilitate transitions based on player interactions.
The state management system is robust, emitting a game-state-updated event
whenever the state changes, which allows other components within the VR envi-
ronment to react dynamically to new states.
<a-gltf-model id="stage"
...
hide-in-state="state: running.debriefing.debriefingPlay;
showOtherwise: true"
...
></a-gltf-model>
All game states are stored directly on the "scene" object as a component, making
them easily accessible for updates and queries throughout the game. Since A-
FrameentitiesuseHTML,theycanbeselectedusingthestandardDOMAPI’slike
document.queryselector.
document.querySelector("a-scene").emit("game-state-event", "loaded");
document.querySelector("a-scene").addEventListener(
"game-state-event", (event) => {
// Handle game state changes
});
document.querySelector("a-scene").addEventListener(
"game-state-updated", (event) => {
// Handle game state updates
};
43.2 Navigation and Movement
Navigation within the virtual space is managed through a navmesh generated
using the recast navmesh library. This mesh, created from GLTF models, defines
where players can move, enhancing the realism of the VR experience.

74 DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF VR EERS
The "ESCape the Classroom" framework provides educators with an intuitive and
robustplatformfordesigningandimplementingmulti-room,multi-puzzlevirtual
reality(VR)educationalescaperooms.Thissectiondelvesintothetechnicaldetails
of the framework, highlighting the design of the user interface, interaction mecha-
nisms, and the integration of educational content within the VR environment.
4.1 Implementing an EER with ESCape the Classroom
Creating an EER with ESCape the Classroom starts by creating an HTML page
and importing the application libraries.
Once the libraries are imported, the VR scene is defined using standard HTML
tags, with the A-Frame library providing the necessary components for creating
3
the D environment. The scene is populated with rooms, puzzles, and interactive
objects, each defined as entities with specific attributes and behaviors.
3
Teachers can download D models from many sources, such as sketchfab, and
import them into the scene using the GTLF standard format.
ESCape the classroom provides multiple A-Frame components that accelerate
creationofanescaperoom,suchasthegame-statecomponent,whichmanagesthe
state of the game,and the simple-navmesh-constraints component,which restricts
player movement to specific areas. The framework also includes an open source
navmesh generator based on recast making it easy to generate navmeshes.
4.2 Interaction Design
Interaction design within the framework is centered around providing a realistic
and engaging user experience that promotes learning. The VR escape rooms sup-
port a variety of interaction types, from simple point-and-click to more complex
manipulationtasks,suchasassemblingorrepairingobjectstosolvepuzzles.These
interactions are facilitated through the use of VR controllers, which allow users to
perform gestures like grabbing, pulling, turning, and pressing within the virtual
environment.
Toenhancetheeducationalvalueoftheescaperooms,interactionsareoftenlinked
to educational outcomes. For example, a puzzle might require learners to solve
a math problem to find the combination to a lock or to perform a sequence of
8chemical reactions to safely dispose of a hazardous material. These tasks encour-
age critical thinking and problem-solving skills, aligning the VR activities with
curriculum objectives.
ESCapetheClassRoomprovidescomponentstohelpfacilitatepuzzlecreationand
interaction within the room, and it’s use of the WebComponent standard means a
community of educators using this framework could share components with each
other.
Since the framework is built on top of A-Frame and the standard web Document-
Object Model, existing knowledge of web development can be leveraged to create
more complex interactions.
4.3 Integration of Educational Content
Educational content is integrated into the VR escape rooms through interactive
puzzles andnarrative elements thatalign withlearning objectives. The framework
supports the embedding of rich media content, including text, images, audio, and
video through the use of standard HTML tags. The framework converts these into
3
D objects, and maps the VR events to the DOM events, allowing for seamless
integrationofmultimediacontent.Thesecanbeusedtoprovideinstructions,back-
ground information, and feedback. This multimedia approach caters to different
learning styles and helps to keep students engaged and motivated.
Teachers can leverage existing web metrics and analytics API’s by attaching them
to the DOM events generated by ESC-CR, allowing educators to track progress
and evaluate learning outcomes using existing tools and APIs. These tools can
collect data on how students interact with different puzzles and how they solve
problems, providing insights into their understanding and areas where they may
need further guidance or support.
5 PUBLISHINGANDCOMPATIBILITYOFVREDUCATIONALESCAPE
ROOMS
The "ESCape the Classroom" framework not only facilitates the creation of virtual
realityeducationalescaperoomsbutalsoaddressesthechallengesassociatedwith
publishing and compatibility across various platforms. This section explores the
mechanisms through which VR escape rooms are published and how they ensure
compatibilitywithabroadspectrumofVRhardware,includinglow-costsolutions
3
like the Meta Quest .
95.1 Publishing VR Escape Rooms
Once an escape room is designed and implemented using the "ESCape the Class-
room" framework, the process of making it accessible is straightforward and effi-
cient. Educators can publish their VR escape rooms directly to the web as WebXR
HTML sites. This method of publishing is significant because it eliminates the
need for users to download and install specific applications or software. Instead,
users can access the VR experiences directly through their web browsers, which
dramatically simplifies distribution and access.
The framework utilizes standard web technologies for deployment, which ensures
that updates and modifications to the VR escape rooms can be rolled out quickly
and seamlessly. This is particularly beneficial for educational settings where con-
tent may need to be refined based on feedback or changing educational needs.
5.2 Ensuring Compatibility Across Devices
Compatibility is a cornerstone of the "ESCape the Classroom" framework. The VR
escaperoomscreatedwiththisplatformaredesignedtobecompatiblewithawide
range of VR hardware. This inclusivity is achieved through the use of responsive
design principles and adaptive scaling technologies that adjust the VR content
according to the capabilities and specifications of the hardware being used.
The framework uses WebXR, a specification published and maintained by the
2018
World Wide Web Consortium (Maclntyre and Smith, ). Any web browser
that supports this specification can potentially be used to view and interact with
ESC-CR experiences. The platform has specifically tested and known working on
2 3
