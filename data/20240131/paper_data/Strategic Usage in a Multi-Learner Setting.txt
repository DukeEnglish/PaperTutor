ProofofProposition6. Let there exist a set of users with features X = {(5),(−5),(0)} and labels Y = {1,−1,1},
making usage decisions in a system with one service choosing models from the linear model class (Example 1) using
feature transformation ϕ(x) = (x,1), using linear utility (Example 2) and hinge loss (Examples 3). Suppose that the

foundinEquations3and5. Thefirstupdatestepcanbeseenasfollows:
θ0 =(cid:2) 1 −1(cid:3)⊤ A0 =(cid:2) 1 0 0(cid:3)⊤
It may be noted that this constitutes a zero-loss equilibrium, as for all users i, A0ℓ(h0,x ,y ) = 0, and for the negative

Here, it can been that for the point (0), A1ℓ(h1,x ,y ) = 0.25. As such, state (H1,A1) does not constitute a zero-loss

satisfied,byLemma4,wehaveshownthatwehavereachedafixedpoint. Therefore,thereisamaximumofnmtimesteps

Given a service j at update k > 0, let us denote hk as the best response to memory Mk updating on usages A. By

the memory update (4), we have that for all users i, Mk = 0 if and only if Mk+1 = 0. By Lemma 2, we have that
