Among many other advertisement techniques, digital billboards have emerged as an
effective approach for the out-of-home advertisement technique 1. In a recent market
survey 2, it has been reported that this advertisement approach leads to more return
on investment. In general, if an advertiser requests some influence from an influence
provider depending upon their budget, the influence provider provides the required
influenceandgainsprofit.Figure1showsaschematicdiagramoftheprocess.Mostof
theexistingliterature[1–6]ontheinfluencemaximizationprobleminbillboardadver-
tisement is solved from the advertiser’s perspective. The key problem addressed in
thesestudiesistochoosek manyinfluentialbillboardslotstomaximizetheinfluence.
However,fromtheinfluenceprovider’spointofview,billboardslotsmustbeallocated
tominimizethetotalregret(formallydefinedinSection3).Hence,deviatingfromthe
existing literature, in this paper, we study the problem of allocating billboard slots
to minimize the overall regret. To the best of our knowledge, other than the study by
[7], there does not exist any other study in this direction.
Background
Now-a-days,billboardsaredigitalandallocatedslot-wisetotheadvertisersfordisplay-
ing their advertisement content. In practice, several advertisers approach an influence
provider for some influence demand on a payment basis. The payment rule is as fol-
lows: if the influence provider provides the demanded or more influence, then the full
paymentwillbemadeelseapartialpaymentmaybebasedonaproratabasis.Inthis
setting, for the influence provider, it will be a loss whether he provides more or less
influence (compared to the demanded one). This loss has been mathematically for-
malized as regret. Detailed discussion on this is deferred till Section 3. The allocation
of the billboard slots needs to be done so that the whole regret is minimized. Next,
we discuss the motivation of our study.
Motivation
At present, a very limited amount of literature on regret analysis in billboard adver-
tisements is available. In all the existing literature [3, 7–10], it has been considered
thattheinfluenceateveryzoneisequallymeaningful.However,itmaynotbethecase
always in practice. Consider the following scenario where we know the demographic
informationregardingacity’spopulation.Then,itisquitenaturalthatitisnotmean-
ingful to display the advertisement content of a costly product in a place where we
know that the population is economically backward classes. Also, it is important to
observe that this only makes sense for the billboards that are placed in residential
zones.Hence,toincorporatethisconcept,wedividethebillboardslotsintotwogroups:
those in crowded locations and those in residential zones. Now, from the advertiser’s
point of view, they may have the demand of zonal specific influence requirements.
This means instead of having a total influence demand, advertisers post zone-specific
influence demand. Consider the geographical region under consideration Z is divided

allocation problem under the zone-specific influence demand constraint is important.
Problem Definition
Consideraninfluenceproviderwithaccesstoabillboarddatabasecontaininginforma-
tionaboutseveraldigitalbillboardsandatrajectorydatabasecontainingthelocation
information over different time stamps of a group of people. A number of advertis-
ers are approaching the influence provider to have a given amount of influence on a
payment basis. As mentioned previously, the payment scheme is as follows: ”If the
influence provider can provide the required or more influence as asked by the adver-
tiser,thentheinfluenceproviderwillgetthefullpaymentorelseapartialpaymentwill
be made”. Now, we analyze the situation from the influence provider’s point of view.
Iftheinfluenceproviderprovideslessinfluence,itwillbealossbecausetheadvertiser
will make a partial payment. Similarly, if it provides more influence than required,
it also causes loss to the influence provider. Because the influence provider does not
get any incentive, on the other hand, this extra influence could have been provided to
the other advertisers whose influence demand has not been fulfilled yet. Both these
losses have been formalized in terms of ‘regret’. This study aims to allocate the bill-
board slots to minimize the total regret while maintaining the zone-specific influence
demand. In this paper, we study this problem as a discrete optimization problem and
propose four solution methodologies.
2 Related Work
This section will discuss the existing literature on regret minimization and influence
maximization that are loosely related to our proposed work. We divide our litera-
ture survey into three major categories: Influential Zone Selection, Trajectory Driven
Influence Maximization, and Regret Minimization.
2.1 Influential Zone Selection
The influential zone or site selection problems gain popularity due to its vast appli-
cation area. In this direction, Cabello et al.[11, 12] first introduce the MaxBRNN
problem. They present an Euclidean distance-based strategy to solve the problem of
locating all points in a dataset whose closest neighbor is a specific query point. Later,
3Du et al. [13] solve optimal location query in spatial databases. They use R∗- tree
and OL-tree-based solution using Manhattan distance. In a similar direction, Xia et
al.[14]addresstheproblemoftop-tmostinfluentialsitesselectionandproposeanew
approachbyextendingtheworkoffindingRNNproposedbyStanoietal.[15]inwhich
R-tree is called many times and that is the drawback of their work. To overcome this,
Xia et al. proposed a novel algorithm called ‘TopInfluentialSites’ in which the R-
tree will be called only once. Next, Zhou et al. [16] extended the MaxBRNN problem
to the MaxBRkNN problem, which identifies an ideal region where establishing a ser-
vice site ensures that the greatest number of consumers will regard the site to be one
of their k nearest service sites. Later, Huang et al. [17] studied the top-k most influ-
ential location selection problem and proposed two branch and bound-based solution
approaches using different geometric properties to prune the search space and per-
form better than a naive-based approach. Extensive experiments on real-world and
synthetic datasets show the efficiency of their proposed methods.
2.2 Trajectory Driven Influence Maximization
Theadvancementofmobileandsensorsincreasestheavailabilityoftrajectorydatasets
[18]. In recent years, Guo et al. [19] have studied the problem of finding k optimal
trajectories rather than identifying k influential sites due to the efficiency of influ-
ence maximization over the trajectory. The primary objective is to identify optimal
trajectories associated with certain advertisements to maximize their impact on tar-
get audiences. Subsequently, Zhang et al. [20] conducted a study that addressed the
issue of identifying a collection of highly influential billboards capable of attracting a
greater number of trajectories while adhering to specific budgetary limitations. They

[21] found that the outdoor advertising business faces challenges in effectively deliver-
ingitsintendedinfluencetotheintendedaudience.Adivide-and-conquer-basedsearch
technique was implemented to address this discrepancy. Instead of just considering
billboards and trajectory, they considered some aspects, including advertisement con-
tent, traffic behavior, and mobility transition. Next, Zahradka et al.[22] did a case
study analysis of the cost of billboard advertising in the different regions of the Czech
Republic.Zhangetal.[23]studiedthetrajectory-driveninfluentialbillboardplacement
problem where a set of billboards, along with its location and cost, is given. The goal
hereistochooseasubsetofthebillboardswithinthebudgetthatinfluencethelargest
number of trajectories. Later, Ali et al. [8, 24] studied the problem of selecting influ-
ential billboard slots and introduced a submodularity graph-based solution approach.
Their main contribution is to prune less influential billboard slots and select the Top-
k most influential slots. Further, Wang et al. [25] studied the problem of the Targeted
OutdoorAdvertisingRecommendation(TOAR)problemconsideringthefactsofuser
profiles and advertisement topics. Their main contribution was a targeted influence
model that characterizes the advertising influence spread along with user mobility.
Based on the divide and conquer approach, they developed two solution strategies.
Implementation with real-world datasets shows the efficiency and effectiveness of the
4proposed solution approaches. There are some loosely related studies with our work
also. Liu et al.[26] developed a visualization tool using large-scale trajectory data to
place the billboards.
2.3 Regret Minimization
Until now, very little literature exists in the context of regret minimization. In the
directionofdatabasequeryoptimization,ak-regretquerywasexamined[27–29]which
addressesdecision-makingbasedonmultiplecriteria.Theirsolutionaimstoovercome
the constraints of both the top-k query, which requires an exact utility function from
the user, and the skyline query, which cannot control the size of the result. A k-
regret query is designed to select k tuples from a given database in such a manner
that ensures the utility of the user’s preferred tuple among these k selections is only
marginally lower than the usefulness of their preferred tuple in the entire database,
regardless of the precise utility function utilized. Further, Xie et al. [30] studied the
problem of minimizing the regret ratio by enhancing user interaction in selecting the
best tuples from the whole database. In social network advertisement, Aslay et al.
[31] introduce a new problem domain that involves allocating users to advertisers to
promote commercial posts. Their approach leverages the network effect and consid-
ersseveralpracticalconsiderations,includingadrelevance,socialproof’simpact,user
attention span, and the constraints imposed by restricted advertiser expenditures.
In a similar direction, few studies in the context of billboard advertisement consider
the minimization of regret causes due to providing influence to the advertiser. Next,
Zhangetal.[7]studiedtheproblemofregretminimizationandproposedseveralsolu-
tion methodologies. Experimentation with real-world datasets showed the efficiency
of the approaches. Recently, Ali et al. [9] introduced an efficient algorithm to mini-
mize the total regret of a billboard provider in a multi-advertiser setting. To the best
of our knowledge, no study exists related to regret minimization under zonal influ-
ence constraint for online or offline advertisement. Motivated by these observations,
we studied the problem of regret minimization under zonal influence constraint by
satisfying zone-specific influence demand in multi-advertiser settings.
Our Contributions
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on regret minimization for bill-
board advertisements considering zonal influence constraint. In particular, we make
the following contributions:
• We study the Regret Minimization in Billboard Advertisement Problem in multi-
advertiser settings for which the literature is very limited.
• We propose four efficient heuristic solutions: Budget-Effective Greedy, Random-
ized Budget-Effective Greedy, Randomized Synchronous Greedy, and Randomized
Advertiser Exchange algorithm for the regret minimization problem.
• We perform an extensive set of experiments with real-world datasets and com-
pare the performance of the proposed solutions with the available strategies in the
literature.
5Organization of the Paper
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 3 describes required background
concepts and defines the problem formally. Section 4 describes the proposed solution
approach with illustration and analysis. Section 5 contains an experimental setup
with different parameter settings and discussion. Section 6 contains the experimental
evaluationsandanalysisoftheproposedsolutionapproaches.Section7concludesthis
study and gives future research directions. Next, we discuss background and problem
definition.
3 Background and Problem Definition
In this section, we describe the background of the problem and formally define our
problem. For any positive integer k, [k] denotes the set {1,2,...,k} and for any two
positive integer x and y, with x ≤ y, [x,y] denotes the set {x,x+1,...,y}. Initially,
we start by describing the notion of billboard and billboard slots.
3.1 Billboards and Billboard Slots
Consider ℓ billboards B = {b ,b ,...,b } are places at different locations of a city.
1 2 ℓ
Eachbillboardb ∈B runsfortheduration[T ,T ],andthesebillboardsareallocated
i 1 2
to different advertisers for a fixed duration denoted by ∆. We call each fixed-duration
slot a billboard slot. We denote a billboard slot as a tuple of the form (b ,[t,t+∆])
i
where b
i
∈B and t∈{T 1,T 1+∆+1,T 1+2∆+1,...,T2 ∆−T1 −∆+1}. We denote the
set of all billboard slots as BS. Given a subset of billboard slots S ⊆ BS, we denote
its influence as I(S) and can be computed in different ways [7, 23]. We consider the
influence is happening by the rule of the triggering model stated in Definition 1
Definition 1 (Influence of Billboard Slots). Given a subset of billboard slots S and a
trajectory database D, the influence of S under the triggering model can be computed
using Equation No. 1.

In this study, we assume that for every b ∈BS and t ∈D, the value of Pr(b ,t )

isknown.Intheliterature[3,7],therearestandardmethodsforcomputingthisvalue.
Next, we describe the notion of Zonal influence constraint.
3.2 Zonal Influence Constraint
Consider that the geographical region under consideration Z is partitioned into k
many disjoint zones z ,z ,...,z . Naturally, any billboard b ∈ B will belong to one
1 2 k i
of the k zones. All the slots associated with the billboard will belong to the zone in
whichthebillboardbelongsto.Hence,thesetofbillboardslotsBScanbepartitioned
into k parts BS ,BS ,...,BS such that for any i ∈ [k], the partition BS contains
1 2 k i
6the billboard slots that belongs to the zone z only. For any advertiser a ∈A, can be

demand of each advertiser is also specific to each zone. Hence, σ can be replaced by
i
the tuple (σ1,σ2,...,σk) where σj denotes the influence demand of the advertiser a
i i i i i
for the zone z . Hence, for any i ∈ [n], σ = (cid:80)k σj. Now, we formally define the
j i j=1 i
zonal influence constraint.

Next, we describe the regret model that we have considered in our study for
billboard slot allocation.
3.3 The Regret Model
As mentioned previously, there are n advertisers, A={a ,a , ...,a } and one influ-
1 2 n
ence provider X. Each advertiser a submits a campaign proposal to the Influence
i
Provider X as follows: “The advertiser a has the influence demand of σ1,σ2,...,σk
i i i i
over the zones z ,z ,...,z on the basis of payment u ”. The influence provider
1 2 k i
X has the advertiser database A whose content are the tuples of the form (a ,<
i
σ1,σ2,...,σk >,u ) for all i ∈ [n]. Let BSzj be the set of billboard slots allocated to
i i i i ai
the advertiser a and belongs to zone z . Now, as per the payment rule for all z ∈Z,
i j j
if I(BSzj) ≥ σj, then the payment of amount u will be made else a partial payment
ai i i
(e.g., pro-rata basis which will be lesser than the u ) will be made.” Now, there are a
i
few important points to highlight.
• ThefirstoneisforanyadvertiserandforanyzoneiftheinfluenceprovidedbyX is
less than what is expected, then this is a loss for X because a partial payment will
be received. We call this regret as the Unsatisfied Regret.
• On the other hand, if X provides more influence than what is expected, that also
leadstoalossforX.Thereasonisasfollows.Assumethatfortheadvertisera and

zone z , I(BSzj)>σj. Now, for providing the excess influence I(BSzj)−σj to the

Also, it may so happen that for any other advertiser a ∈ A\{a } at the zone z ,
x i j
I(BSzj) < σj. So, some of the billboard slots from BSzj can be included to BSzj
sucha tx hat I(Bx Szj)≥σj. We call the regret of this kinda ti he Excessive Regret. ax

Combining these two cases, we define the regret model considered in this paper in
Definition 3.
Definition 3 (The Regret Model). Let, for the advertiser a ∈A, the set of allocated

billboard slots is BS and the regret associated with this allocation for the zone z is

The developed solution methodologies in this paper are independent of the choice
of γ, and it has been explained further in Section 5 of this paper.
3.4 Allocation of Billboard Slots
The task is to allocate the billboard slots among the advertisers. The goal is to
minimize the total regret while the following two constraints are satisfied:
• Zonal Influence Constraint : This constraint means that for any advertiser a ∈A,
i
and zone z ∈Z, I(BSzj)≥σj.
• Disjointnesj s Constraina ti : Fori any two advertisers a and a , let BS and BS
x y ax ay
denotes the set of billboard slots allocated to a and a , respectively. The dis-
x y
jointness constraint implies that any billboard slot (b ,[t,t+∆]) ∈ BS can not be
i
allocated to more than one advertiser. Hence, BS ∩BS =∅.

Definition 4 (Feasible Allocation). An allocation of the billboard slots is said to be a
feasibleallocationifitsatisfiesboththeZonalInfluenceConstraintandthedisjointness
constraint.
As mentioned previously, the objective of the allocation is to minimize the total
regret. So, we define the notion of total regret for an allocation in Definition 5.
Definition 5 (Total Regret Associated with an Allocation). Given an allocation of
the billboard slots Y = {BS ,BS ,...,BS } the total regret associated with the
a1 a2 an
allocation Y is denoted by R(Y) and defined as the sum of the regret associated with
the individual advertisers. In turn, the regret due to the allocation of one advertiser
can be obtained by summing up the corresponding zonal regrets.

Influence Constraint Problem. This problem has been stated in Definition 6.
8Definition 6 (RegretMinimizationwithZonalInfluenceConstraint). Given the bill-
board slot information BS, a trajectory database D, and the advertiser database A, the
goal of this problem is to create an allocation Y ={BS ,BS ,...,BS } in which the
a1 a2 an
set of billboard slots BS are allocated to the advertiser a such that the total regret is

The regret minimization problem in the context of billboard advertisement has been
studied by Zhang et al. [7] without the zonal influence constraint. They had an
inappoximability result stated in Theorem 1.
Theorem 1. Regret Minimization with Zonal Influence Constraint Prob-
lem is NP-hard to solve optimally, and it is also hard to obtain any constant factor
approximation algorithm.
This means that the same inappoximability result will also hold for our problem
as well. Next, we proceed to describe the proposed solution methodologies.
4 Proposed Solution
The hardness of the problem implies that any efficient algorithm with a theoretical
guarantee for optimal regret does not exist unless P = NP. Now, we define the notion
of budget-effective advertiser in Definition 7.
Definition 7 (Budget Effective Advertiser). Given any two advertisers a ,a ∈ A
i j
with their respective proposal (a ,σ ,u ) and (a ,σ ,u ), a is said to be more budget
i i i j j j i
effective than a j if (u σii > u σjj) holds.
Consideringitshardness,weproposetwoefficientalgorithms:(1)BudgetEffective
Greedy and (2) Randomized Budget Effective Greedy that will satisfy more budget-
effective advertisers while minimizing the total regret for the influence provider’s
perspective.
4.1 Budget-Effective Greedy (BG)
We introduce a heuristic Greedy in Algorithm 1. First, initialize a set of empty bill-
board slots set in Line No. 1. Next, sort each advertiser in descending order based on

Complexity Analysis.Now,weanalyzethetimeandspacerequirementofAlgo-
rithm 1. In-Line No. 1, initializing Y as a set of empty billboard slots set will take
O(n) time. Sorting advertisers in Line No. 2 will take O(nlogn) time. It is clear that
For Loop at Line No. 3 will iterate for n number of advertisers, and it will take O(n)
time to execute. Line No. 4 For Loop will execute at most k times, and it takes O(k)
time.Now,intheworstcase,While LoopatLineNo.5willexecuteatmostthenum-
ber of billboard slots a zone has, and to compute the regret in Line No. 6, we need to
compute the influence for l number of slots that takes O(n.k.ℓ.t) time where t is the
number of tuple in the trajectory database. Line No. 7 and 8 will take O(n.k) time.
Hence, Line No. 3 to 11 will take O(n.k.ℓ.t+n.k) time to execute. So, the total time
taken by Algorithm 1 is O(n+nlogn+n.k.ℓ.t+n.k) i.e., O(nlogn+n.k.ℓ.t). The
extra space is taken by Algorithm 1 to store the billboard slots list Y and Advertisers
list A both will take O(n) space. As k number of zones is there, to store them, it will
take O(k) extra space. In the worst case, S will take O(ℓ) extra space as at most ℓ
i
many billboard slots can be allocated to satisfy the zonal influence requirement of an
advertiser. Hence, the total extra space required by Algorithm 1 is O(n+n+k+ℓ)
i.e., O(n+k+ℓ).
ThoughAlgorithm1issimpletounderstandandeasytoimplement,thisalgorithm
isextremelyinefficient,asmentionedinSection5.Thisisparticularlyduetothehuge
number of marginal gain computations. To eliminate this problem, we propose the
randomized budget effective greedy algorithm.
104.2 Randomized Budget-Effective Greedy (RG)
Algorithm 2 represents the randomized budget-effective greedy heuristic search in the
formofpseudocode.Atfirst,inLineNo.1,weinitializeanemptysetofbillboardslots
set for each advertiser. Next, each advertiser is sorted in descending order based on
the advertiser’s budget over influence demand. Each advertiser has influence demand
over different zones, and to satisfy this quantity, in Line No. 3 For Loop iterates
over all the advertisers, and in Line No. 4, For Loop iterates over different zone for
each advertiser. Now, in Line No. 5, billboard slots for a particular zone are sorted in
ascendingorderaccordingtotheirindividualinfluencevalue.Next,inLineNo.8to13
While Loop iterates over all the slots of a zone to satisfy the zonal influence demand
of an advertiser. From this While Loop, a maximum number of billboard slots set
that satisfy the zonal influence demand of an advertiser is generated. So, from Line
No. 14 to 19, a greedy heuristic is applied to fulfill the advertiser’s influence demand
by assigning slots according to zonal influence requirement and best reduce the total
regret.Now,inLineNo.14,foreachadvertiserwithcorrespondingzonalinformation,

This procedure will continue till all the advertisers are satisfied or no more billboard
slots remain, and finally, the billboard slot set Y will be returned.
Complexity Analysis.Now,weanalyzethetimeandspacerequirementofAlgo-
rithm 2. In-Line No. 1 initializing Y will take O(n) time, and Line No. 2 will take

in Line No. 5 based on individual influence value will take O(n.k.ℓlogℓ) time, and

Loop will execute for O(n.k.ℓ) time as in the worst case, a zone has at most ℓ num-
ber of billboard slots. Line No. 9,11,12 will take O(n.k) time execute, but Line No.
10 will take O(n.k.ℓ.t) as each time needs to compute the influence using Equation

4.3 Randomized Synchronous Greedy Approach (RSG)
Budget-effectivegreedysuffersfromallocatingbillboardslotsfairly,asmostinfluential
slots are allocated to some of the most budget-effective advertisers. The unsatisfied
regret plays a significant role compared to excessive regret to produce total regret
in our regret model described in Section 3. So, the advertisers who are unsatisfied
due to billboard slots running out are not preferable to consider. To address this, we
introduce a synchronous greedy approach in Algorithm 3 in which slots are allocated
synchronouslytoovercomethedrawbackofbudget-effectivegreedy.First,inLineNo.
1, initialize a set of empty billboard slots set. In Line No. 2, all advertisers are sorted
according to their budget effectiveness. Next, in Line No. 3 to 21, synchronously allo-
catebillboardslotstoeachadvertiserindividually,reducingtheregretbest.InLineNo.
22 to 34, the number of unsatisfied advertisers is calculated after allocating billboard

12still unsatisfied, then release advertisers one by one according to less budget effective-
nessandallocatethereleasedslotstootherunsatisfiedones.Thisprocedurecontinues
until all the remaining advertisers are satisfied or no further improvement occurs.
Complexity Analysis. Now, we analyze the time and space requirements of
Algorithm 3. In-Line No. 1 initializing Y will take O(n) time and Line No. 2, to sort
the advertisers will take O(nlogn) time. Now, in Line No. 4 For Loop executes for
O(n) time, and in Line No. 5 For Loop executes for O(k) time as there are n number
of advertisers and k number of influential zones respectively. To sort the advertisers
in Line No. 6 based on their individual influence value will take O(n.k.ℓlogℓ) time,
and Line No. 7 will take O(n.k) time for initialization. Now, in Line No. 8 While
Loop will execute for O(n.k.ℓ) time as in the worst case, a zone has at most ℓ number
of billboard slots. Line No. 9,11,12 will take O(n.k) time execute, but Line No. 10
will take O(n.k.ℓ.t) as each time needs to compute the influence using Equation 1.
So, Line No. 8 to 13 will take O(n.k.ℓ + n.k.ℓ.t) time in total. In the worst case,
While Loop in Line No. 14 will execute for O(n.k.ℓ) time. In-Line No. 15 to sample

Now, the additional space requirement to store the lists Y, A, BS , S′, and S

will be of O(n), O(n), O(ℓ), O(ℓ), and O(ℓ), respectively. To store zonal information
of billboard slots will take O(k) space. Hence, the total extra space requirement for
Algorithm 3 will be of O(k+2n+3ℓ), i.e., O(k+n+ℓ).
4.4 Randomized Advertiser Exchange Approach (RAE)
In the ‘RSG’ approach, after allocating billboard slots, if more than two advertisers
are still unsatisfied, we release advertisers one by one according to their budget effec-
tiveness and allocate released billboard slots to the remaining unsatisfied ones. Now,
after the allocation of billboard slots to the advertisers in the ‘RSG’ approach, the

objective is to achieve an allocation such that total regret is minimized. First, instead
14of an empty set of billboard slot set, the final non-empty advertisers set returned by
Algorithm 3 is considered the input of the ‘RAE’ approach. In Line No. 3, make a
copy of Yfinal as Ytemp, and Line No. 4 For Loop will iterates for all the advertisers,
a ∈A whereas For Loop at Line No. 5 iterates for all the advertisers a ∈A\{a }.

Complexity Analysis. Now, we analyze the time and space requirement of
Algorithm 4. First, in Line No. 1 ‘RSG’ approach will take O(n.k.ℓlogℓ+n.k.ℓ.t+

will execute for O(n) time and For Loop at Line No. 5 will execute for n−1 times as
total n number of advertisers are there. At Line No. 6 in the worst case, exchanging
slots between a with a will take O(ℓ) time and to calculate regret of Ytemp we need
i j
15to compute the influence of ℓ number of slots that will take O(n2.ℓ.t) time where t is
the number of tuple in the trajectory database. In Line No. 7 to 10 will take O(n2)
time to execute. Hence, from Line No. 4 to 13 will take O(n2.ℓ.t+n2.ℓ+n2) time. In
LineNo.14regretwillbecalculatedtwiceanditwilltakeO(2.n2.ℓ.t)time.Finally,in
Line No. 15 copying from Ytemp to Yfinal will take O(n) time. Therefore, Algorithm
4willtaketotalO(n2.ℓ.t+n2.ℓ+n2+2.n2.ℓ.t+n2)i.e.,O(n2.ℓ.t)timetoexecuteone
iteration of the While Loop in Line no 2. Now, the additional space requirement for
Algorithm 4 is for Yfinal and Ytemp will be O(n) and O(n) respectively. Hence, total
space requirement of Algorithm 4 will be O(n+n) i.e., O(n).

‘RG’ approach to satisfy their zone specific influence requirements. After allocation,

this allotment, the ‘RSG’ approach applied to release unsatisfied advertisers one by

5.2 Parameter Setting
In this study, the following parameter values need to be fixed, and we describe them
briefly. All key parameters and their corresponding values are summarized in Table 3.

Table 3: Key Parameters
Demand-Supply Ratio (δ)
Itdenotestheratiooftheglobalinfluencedemandovertheinfluenceprovider’ssupply,
i.e., δ = σA/σh, where σA = (cid:80)|A| σa refers the global demand, and σh refers the
a=1
total influence supply, i.e., σh =(cid:80) σ(b).
b∈BS
Average-Individual Demand Ratio (λ)
It refers to the ratio of individual demand of advertisers and the influence provider’s
supply, i.e., λ =
σA/|A|.
By adjusting the λ value, we can control the individual
σh
demand of an advertiser.
Penalty Ratio (γ)
It decides how much penalty should be imposed on an influence provider due to the
advertiser’s dissatisfaction. As described in Equation 3, two extreme case arises: (1)
when γ = 0, the influence provider does not receive any payment if the advertiser is
not satisfied. (2) when γ = 1, the influence provider will receive the same fraction of
payment as the fraction of influence it provides to the advertiser.
18Accuracy Speed-up parameter (ϵ)
It is a user-defined parameter that decides the sample set size from which a slot is
chosen to allocate in Algorithm 2. The ϵ value is set to 0.01,0.05,0.1,0.15, and 0.2 to
simulate different sample set sizes in our experiment.
Advertiser’s Demand (σ)
EachadvertisersdemandintheAdvertiserdatasetisgeneratedusingλ,andσh.Itcan
be represented as σa = ⌊α.σa.λ⌋, where α is a parameter randomly chosen between
0.8 to 1.2 to generate different demand values of the advertiser.
Advertiser’s Payment (u)
Previousstudies[23,31]consideredcostisproportionaltoitscorrespondinginfluence.
So, we generate the advertiser’s payment as u=⌊β.σa⌋, where β is a factor randomly
chosen between 0.9 to 1.1.
Environment Setup
All proposed and baseline methods have been implemented in Python using the
Jupyter Notebook platform. All experiments are conducted in a Ubuntu-operated
desktop system with 64 GB RAM and an Xeon(R) 3.50 GHz processor.
Performance Measurement
We have conducted each experiment three times, and average results are reported.
In our experiment, we calculate two types of regret: Unsatisfied and Excessive, which
leads to total regret.
5.3 Methods in the Experimentation
5.3.1 Baseline Methodologies
Wehavemadeacomparisonofourproposedapproacheswithexistingbaselinesolution
methodologies.
Random Allocation
Inthismethod,first,sorteachadvertiserindescendingorderbasedonbudgeteffective-
ness,i.e.,totalbudgetovertotalinfluencedemand.Next,billboardslotsareallocated
uniformly at random to the advertisers one by one to fulfill their zone-specific influ-
ence demand. This allocation scheme will continue till all advertisers are satisfied or
billboard slots run out.
Top-k Allocation
At first, the individual influence of all billboard slots is computed, and based on
influence value, slots are sorted in descending order. Similarly, advertisers are also
sorted based on budget effectiveness in descending order. Next, from this sorted list,
billboard slots are allocated to each advertiser one by one till the influence demand of
all the advertisers is satisfied or no more slots remain to allocate.
195.3.2 Proposed Methodologies
Here, we describe our proposed methods briefly.
Budget-Effective Greedy (RG)
Budget Effective Greedy is the heuristic approach where, in each step, we compute
the marginal gain for all billboard slots and pick one slot among them, which reduces
the total regret best. This process will continue till all the advertisers are satisfied or
billboard slots run out.
Randomized Budget-Effective Greedy (RG)
Itisarandomizedheuristicgreedyapproachwhereineachstep,insteadofcomputing
marginal gain for all billboard slots, we compute marginal gain from randomly sam-
pling out a billboard slot set P of size |BSzj| log1, which in turn overlaps with BS
|S′| ϵ zj
i
with the probability of (1−ϵ), and pick out billboard slot which reduces the regret
best. These slots are allocated to the advertisers one by one until all advertisers are
satisfied or no billboard slots remain to allocate.
Randomized Synchronous Greedy (RSG)
We introduce the Randomized Synchronous Greedy Approach to overcome the draw-
backs of both the ‘BG’ and ‘RG’ approaches. The ‘BG’ satisfied many advertisers
with minimal regret but took substantial computational time. On the other hand,
‘RG’ compromises with regret but reduces computational time. Both approaches suf-
fer from higher total regret in which, in most cases, an unsatisfied penalty plays an
importantrole.Toresolvethisissue,‘RSG’firstallocatesbillboardslotstotheadver-
tisersusingthe‘RG’approach.Next,ifmorethantwoadvertisersarestillunsatisfied,
remove them one by one according to less budget effectiveness. In that way, we can
reduce unsatisfied regret. However, excessive regret increases, and the overall regret
decreases compared to the ‘RG’.
Randomized Advertiser Exchange Approach (RAE)
The‘RAE’approachisarandomizedlocalsearchapproach.Afterallocatingbillboard
slots to the advertisers using the ‘RSG’ approach, there may always be a chance that
a better allocation exists compared to the current allocation. To address this, in the
‘RAE’ approach, we exchange billboard slots among advertisers; if swapping slots
will minimize total regret, then exchange occurs. In that way, we finally get a better
allocation on top of the ‘RSG’ approach.
5.4 Goals of Our Experimentation
We fix the following research questions:
• RQ1: What will happen if the influence provider’s maximum supply, (σh) is far
below, near, or exceeded by the total global demand, (σA) of all advertisers?
• RQ2:Whichkindofadvertiserismorebeneficialtotheinfluenceproviderinterms

20• RQ3: Varying δ with a fixed value of λ, and |A|, how the regret value change?
• RQ4:Varyingδwithafixedvalueofλ,and|A|,howthecomputationalcostchange?
• RQ5:Howthepenaltyratio,γ andthespeed-upparameter,ϵimpactonminimizing

6 Results and Discussions
Inthissection,wediscusstheexperimentalresultsandtheimpactsofdifferentparam-
eters on the NYC and LA datasets. We formulate total regret by combining two
components: unsatisfied regret and excessive regret, as described in definition 3. To
address RQ1, we vary the demand-supply ratio (δ), from 40% to 120%. When δ value
is very low, i.e., maximum influence supply (σh) is high and global demand (σA)
is low, almost all the advertisers are satisfied. However, when the δ value is higher,
then σA is also higher or even exceeds the total influence supply. So, the number of
satisfied advertisers becomes less. Next, to answer RQ2, we vary the average individ-
ual demand-supply ratio from 1% to 20%, which represents the individual demand of
advertisers from low to high. In the following, to address the research questions RQ3,
RQ4,andRQ5,wepresenttheexperimentalresultsofboththeNYCandLAdatasets.
6.1 Effectiveness Study
We represent our results under four significant cases of the NYC and LA datasets. To
describe total regret in the results, we use stacked bars, and two components in each
bar denote the percentage of unsatisfied regret and excessive regret, respectively. It
is possible that in the results, only one component is in the stacked bar (e.g., when
all the advertisers are fully satisfied, then unsatisfied regret is zero). Next, we discuss
experimental observations over the NYC dataset.
6.1.1 Observations over NYC dataset
Case 1: δ ≤ 80%, λ ≤ 5% (parts (a,b,c,f,g,h,k,ℓ,m) of Figure 2. This refers
to the situation where both global and individual demand are low. So, the influence
providerhasadvertiserswhoseinfluencedemandisminimal.Astheδ valueislow,the
influencesupplyishigherthantheglobalinfluencedemandoftheadvertisers.However,
inmostcases,zone-specificinfluencedemandisnotsatisfiedforafewadvertisers,and
theyremainunsatisfied.Totalregretconsistsofexcessiveandunsatisfiedregretinmost
cases except the ‘RSG’ and ‘RAE’. Now, we have two main observations. First, when
δ increases,excessiveregretdecreases,andunsatisfiedregretincreases.Thisisbecause
when δ increases, the zone-specific global influence demand also increases. As every
zone has only a limited number of billboard slots, the zone-specific influence demand
of each advertiser is not satisfied. Second, in most experiments, ‘RSG’ and ‘RAE’
control the unsatisfied regret much better than ‘BG’ and ‘RG’. The ‘RSG’ can satisfy
more advertisers because it releases unsatisfied advertisers individually and allocates
released slots to the remaining unsatisfied ones. The ‘RAE’ exchanges billboard slots
between advertisers according to the solution of ’RSG’. So, ‘RAE’ can satisfy more or
an equal number of advertisers than ’RSG’. Third, in the base case where δ = 40%
21and λ = 1%, i.e., the global influence demand is deficient compared to the influence
supply. The influence provider has advertisers with small influence demand. However,
a few advertisers are unsatisfied due to not fulfilling zone-specific influence demand.
Forexample,‘RG’,‘BG’,‘RSG’and‘RAE’numbersofsatisfiedadvertisersare64,66,
69, and 69, respectively. The ‘RSG’ and ‘RAE’ outperform ‘RG’ by about 47% and
49%, respectively.

situationwhereglobalinfluencedemandislow.However,individualinfluencedemand
ishigh.Theinfluenceproviderhasasmallnumberofadvertisers,andeachadvertiser’s
influence demand is high. We have three observations. First, as individual influence
demand is high, excessive regret for all the proposed and baseline methods drops in
most results. The number of satisfied advertisers is much less; as a result, unsatis-
fied penalty plays a significant role in total regret. Second, due to higher individual
influence demand, influence providers allocate more billboard slots to the advertisers.
When δ increases from 40% to 80%, the unsatisfied regret rises for all the proposed
and baseline approaches. Third, the ‘RSG’ and ‘RAE’ return minimum total regret
by releasing advertisers individually. The ‘RAE’ has a more extensive search space to
exchange billboard slots among advertisers to reduce total regret. For example, con-
sider a scenario when δ =40%,λ=10%, and |A|=10 then ‘RAE’ outperforms ‘RG’,
and ‘BG’ by about 89%, and 88%, respectively.
Case 3: δ ≥100%,, λ≤5% (parts (d,e,i,j,n,o) of Figure 2.Thisrepresentsa
scenariowhereglobaldemandisveryhigh,butindividualinfluencedemandislow.The
influence provider has a large number of advertisers with small individual influence
demand.Wehavetwomainobservations.First,inthecontextofasignificantlyhigher
global demand, it is evident that none of the algorithms can satisfy the requirements
of all advertisers. Hence, the unsatisfied penalty becomes higher and substantially
contributes to total regret. Here, two cases arise: (1) when δ = 100%, the global
demand and supply are equal. However, there is unsatisfied regret as the excessive
regretcannotbeminimized.(2)whenδ =120%,theglobalinfluencedemandexceeds
the total influence supply. So, unsatisfied regret increases. Second, the ‘RSG’ and
‘RAE’ reduce total regret compared to the ‘RG’ and ‘BG’ but scarifies the majority
of unsatisfied advertisers. For example, consider a scenario when δ = 100%,λ = 1%,
and |A| = 100 then ‘RAE’ outperforms ‘RG’ and ‘BG’ by about 82%, and 80%,
respectively. However, the ‘RAE’ satisfies equal or more advertisers than ‘BG’ and
‘RG.’
Case 4: δ ≥100%,, λ≥10% (parts (s,t,x,y) of Figure 2.Accordingtocase4,
we have a situation where both global and individual influence demand is very high.
The influence provider has a small number of advertisers whose influence demand is
very high. We have two main observations. First, the unsatisfied regret is very high
withhigherδandλvalues.However,noexcessiveregretexistsastheadvertiser’szone-
specificinfluencedemandisunsatisfied.Hence,alltheproposedandbaselineapproach
suffers from higher unsatisfied regret. Second, when λ value increases from 10% to
20%, the individual demand also increases. So, the unsatisfied penalty becomes much
higher. All the proposed and baseline approaches produce higher regret except ‘RSG’
and ‘RAE’. The ‘RSG’ reduces total regret and releases many unsatisfied advertisers.
6.1.2 Observations over LA dataset
In our experiments, we have different observations on the LA dataset compared to
the NYC dataset. Here, we discuss experimental results over the LA dataset in four
different cases.
23Case1:δ ≤80%,λ≤5%(parts(a,b,c,f,g,h,k,ℓ,m)ofFigure3.Correspond-
ing to case 1, we have low λ, low δ, and this arises a situation where both the global
and individual influence demand is low. The influence provider has a large number of
advertisers with low individual influence demand. we have three main observations.
First, no unsatisfied regret exists because every zone has sufficient billboard slots to
allocate. When δ increases, the excessive regret for all the algorithms drops. Second,
amongbaselinemethods,‘Top-k’controlsexcessiveregretbetter.Thisisbecause‘Top-
k’ allocates the most influential billboard slots individually to the advertisers. So, it
is easy to fulfill the influence demand of all the advertisers with fewer billboard slots.
Now, among the proposed approach the ‘RAE’ performs better than the ‘RG’, and
‘RSG’ methods. Third, all the advertisers are satisfied in a scenario in which δ =40%
andλ=1%.The‘Top-k’and‘Random’outperformtheproposedapproachesbecause
they control excessive regret better.
Case 2: δ ≤ 80%,, λ ≥ 10% (parts (p,q,r,u,v,w) of Figure 3. Correspond-
ing to case 2, we have low δ and high λ, representing a situation where influence
provider have fewer advertisers with high individual influence demand. We have two
observations. First, although higher individual influence demand, all the advertisers
aresatisfied.Thisisbecausewhenλincreases,thenumberofadvertisersbecomesless,
andinfluenceproviderhavetosatisfyfeweradvertisers.Second,totalregretdecreases
when the δ value increases from 40% to 80% for all the proposed approaches. As
advertisers have higher individual influence demand, the influence provider can allo-
cate more billboard slots to each. So, the ‘RAE’ has a more extensive search space to
exchange billboard slots between each advertiser. Consequently, ‘RAE’ outperforms
all the proposed approaches, although ‘Random’ and ‘Top-k’ still perform well.
Case 3: δ ≥100%,, λ≤5% (parts (d,e,i,j,n,o) of Figure 3. This represents
a situation where global influence demand is high and individual influence demand
is low. The influence provider has a larger advertiser base in which advertisers have
a small individual influence demand. We have two main observations. First, with a
high δ value 100% to 120%, the advertiser’s demand equals or exceeds the influence
provider supply. So, the proposed approaches can only satisfy some advertisers as the
excessive regret cannot be diminished. When δ = 120%, none of the algorithms can
satisfy all the advertisers as their influence demand is much less than the influence
supplybytheinfluenceprovider.Second,the‘RSG’and‘RAE’impactismuchbetter
than other proposed and baseline methods in reducing total regret. It is important
to highlight that the deployment of slots to the advertisers when the δ value is very
high. However, there is a risk of losing more advertisers as global influence demand
is very high compared to the influence provider supply. The ‘RSG’ and ‘RAE’ handle
the risk best. They averagely outperform the ‘RG’ and ‘BG’ by four times and two
times, respectively.
Case 4: δ ≥ 100%,, λ ≥ 10% (parts (s,t,x,y) of Figure 3. According to
case 4, we have a situation where both the global and individual influence demand is
very high. Hence, the influence provider has fewer advertisers with higher individual
influence demand. We have two main observations. First, higher δ and λ will lead
to higher unsatisfied regret to the influence provider. Hence, all the algorithms suffer
from higher regret, and no one can satisfy all the advertisers. The influence provider

from 10% to 20%, the excessive regret decreases while the total regret rises due to
higherunsatisfiedregret.Here,onemusthighlightthatthe‘BG’leadstomuchhigher

AfteranalyzingfourNYCandLAdatasetscases,wecananswerRQ1,RQ2,andRQ3.
(1) As previously discussed, excessive regret dominates total regret when the global
demand is deficient. So, it is difficult to select advertisers for deploying billboard slots
tominimizethetotalregret.Basedonourobservations,whentheadvertiser’sdemand
is equal or at most two times larger than the average influence of billboard slots, we
experiencehigherexcessiveregret.However,withtheincrementofadvertiser’sdemand
byfivetimesormore,theexcessiveregretdecreases,asshowninFigure2,3(a,b,c).(2)
Increasingglobaldemandreducesexcessiveinfluence,butatthesametime,itwilllead
to unsatisfied penalties (e.g., Figure 2,3 (d,e,i,j)). We observe that a large number
of small or medium individual-demanded advertisers are ideal for influence providers.
These advertisers are more flexible in allocating billboard slots and will return the
minimum amount of unsatisfied regret to the influence provider. (3) To address RQ3,
we vary δ and λ from 40% to 120% and 1% to 20%. Corresponding observations are
already discussed in four cases, as shown in Figures 2 and 3.
6.2 Efficiency Study
Efficiency is important in such cases where more than a thousand advertisers daily
cometotheinfluenceproviderwiththeirzone-specificinfluencerequirements,andthe
influence provider needs to handle more than a thousand billboards in a city like New
York and Los Angeles. We have conducted experiments over different δ and λ values
for both NYC and LA datasets, as reported in Figures 4 and 5. We have a couple of
observations.
First,the‘RG’takeslesstimethanotherproposedapproachestodeploybillboard
slots to advertisers. The ‘RSG’ and ‘RAE’ approaches take more time than the ‘RG’
because they use the allocation provided by the ‘RG’ as their initial allocation and
furthertrytoimprovetheeffectivenessbyreleasingadvertisersorexchangingbillboard
slots among advertisers. The ‘BG’ takes more time than the ‘RG’ because, in each
iteration, it computes the marginal gain for all the billboard slots, while in the ‘RG’,
each iteration only computes the marginal gain for a randomly chosen subset of slots.
Second, when the δ value increases from 40% to 120%, all algorithms’ computa-
tional cost increases except the ‘RAE’. This is because when δ rises, the individual
influence demand of each advertiser also increases. Then, the influence provider must
allocatemorebillboardslotstotheadvertisers,producingmoreextensivesearchspace
and taking more time. Additionally, the number of unsatisfied advertisers and unsat-
isfied regret increases with the rising δ value. Hence, the ‘RSG’ takes more time to
release unsatisfied advertisers and allocate released slots to other unsatisfied ones.
Third, with an increase of λ value from 1% to 20%, all algorithms’ computational
costdecreasesexceptthe‘BG’.Whenλincreases,thenumberofadvertisersdecreases,
and the influence provider needs to allocate billboard slots to a few advertisers. How-
ever, the time requirement for the ‘BG’ is consistent with the increasing λ because of
the large number of marginal gain computations in each iteration.
Fourth, the ‘RAE’ approach increases computational time with the δ increase.
However, in some cases, when exchanging billboard slots does not minimize the total
26regret, or no further improvement occurs during allocation, the algorithm exits, and
its computational time is not much increased as represented in Figure 4 and 5.
Fifth, One thing that needs to be highlighted is that when the δ value increases,
the computational time difference between different δ values is huge in the case of
the ‘RAE’. However, this difference is much less in the case of all other baseline and
proposed algorithms.

6.3 Additional Parameters Study
This section discusses the additional parameters used in our experiments, e.g., η, γ,
and ϵ. First, we observe that the total regret for all the proposed and baseline meth-
ods increases with the increase of distance (η). As one billboard slot can influence
more trajectories, the influence provider’s supply, σh, increases. While increasing σh
but fixing the value of δ and λ, the advertiser’s demand increases, and consequently,
regretrisesproportionally.Second,weobservedthatγ playsakeyroleintheincrease
of unsatisfied regret. As we previously discussed in Definition 3, γ controls the unsat-
isfied regret for the unsatisfied advertisers. When the γ value is very small, influence
providers suffer from higher regret. However, when the γ value increases, the unsatis-
fied regret decreases, as represented in Figure 6 and 7. Third, the accuracy speed-up
parameter, ϵ, plays acrucial role in the‘RG’,‘RSG’, and ‘RAE’algorithms, and from
Figure 8 and 9, it is clear that when ϵ value increases, total regret also increases, but
computational time decreases.

Revisit RQ4, and RQ5.
Based on our observations in section 6.2 and 6.3, we can answer RQ4 and RQ5.
(1) when we vary the δ value from 40% to 120%, the computational cost for all the
algorithms also rises for both the NYC and LA datasets. With the increasing value of
δ, each advertiser’s individual influence demand and unsatisfied regret also increases.
(2) when γ value increases from 0 to 1, the total regret of an advertiser decreases.
γ =0 provides higher regret while γ =1 provides lower regret as only the fraction of
influenceprovidedtotheadvertiserisreturningasregret.Next,withtheincreaseϵ,an
advertiser’stotalregretincreasesbecausetherandomlyselectedsamplesizedecreases

7 Conclusion and Future Directions
In this paper, we have studied the problem of regret minimization in billboard adver-
tisements under zonal influence constraint in a multi-advertiser setting. We have
proposedaBudget-EffectiveGreedyalgorithmtoallocatebillboardslotstotheadver-
tisers. To improve its performance further, we proposed the ‘RG’, ‘RSG’, and ‘RAE’
algorithms. All the methods have been analyzed to understand their time and space
requirements. They have been implemented with real-world datasets and compared
with existing methods to show their effectiveness and efficiency. Our future study of
thisproblemwillfocusondevelopingmoreefficientlocalsearchtechniquestoimprove
the performance further.
