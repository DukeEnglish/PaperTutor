1 Introduction
A certain city decided to experiment with participatory budgeting Cabannes [2004], Goel et al.
[2019],ReyandMaly[2023].Thecitycouncilfixedthebudgetandinvitedthecitizenstopropose
projectsthatmightbeimplemented,lettingthemknowthatthefundingdecisionswillbemadeby
voting.Soon,threegroupsofactivistsformed,onefocusedoncyclinginfrastructure,onecommitted
to making the city greener, and one dedicated to improving the quality of life for senior citizens.
Eachgroupdecidedtosubmitasingleproject,buttheyquicklyrealizedthattheyhavemanyoptions
to choose from. For example, cycling enthusiasts could propose repainting the markings on a few
bike paths, which would be very cheap, or they could request one or more new bike paths, which
wouldcostmore,or—withthefullavailablebudget—theycouldgreatlyimprovethewholebiking
infrastructure while also offering free bikes forrent. In other words, they could spend any amount
of money on cycling (at least if it were above a certain necessary minimum) and the more they
could get, the better a project they could offer. Not surprisingly, the other groups reached similar
conclusions.Buthowmuchmoneycouldtheyaskfor,realistically?
Ifthecityhadalonghistoryofparticipatorybudgetingelections,theactivistscouldassessthe
level of support for their causes based on past experience. In our case, they simply ran a survey.
Whiletheycouldnotaskaboutthesupportforspecificprojects—afterall,theywerenotsurewhat
toproposeyet—theyfoundoutthatmanypeoplewouldsimplyvoteforbiking-,ecology-,orseniors-
oriented projects, irrespecitve of their costs; they simply wanted improvements on these fronts (or
even several of them). The survey showed that biking enthusiasts have the largest vote share, but
othergroupsalsohadstrongsupport.
Withthisinformationinhand,choosingaproject’scostlargelydependsonthevotingruleused.
For example, if the city used the BasicAV rule,1 which greedily selects those projects that are ap-
proved by the largest numbers of voters (provided they still fit in the remaining budget), then the

this game-theoretic nature of project cost selection under various participatory budgeting rules (in

Section2fordetails).Inotherwords,weconsideragamewhereprojectproposers(or,forsimplicity,
theprojects)aretheplayers,projectcostsaretheirstrategies,andcostsofselectedprojects(minus
their delivery costs) are their payoffs. We analyze whether these games have pure Nash equilibria
and, if so, what costs are reported under these equilibria. Studying strategic cost selection is also
a natural direction in market analysis and is present, e.g., in the context of the Hotelling-Downs
model(e.g.,intheworkofEiselt[2011]).
Naturally, our game presents a simplified view of reality. However, due to abstracting away
fromexcessivecomplexities,ourstudyledtofindinginteresting,andyettechnicallychallengingto

sophisticated scenarios. Multiple natural extensions of our games will become apparent, after we

2 Preliminaries
ParticipatoryBudgeting. WedefineaPBinstance(alsosometimesreferredtoasaPBelection)
as a tuple E = (P,V,B,cost), where P = {p ,...,p } is a set of projects, V = {v ,...,v }
1 m 1 n
is a set of voters, B ∈ R is the available budget, and cost: P → R is a function specifying
+ +
the cost of each project. Each voter v casts a nonempty approval ballot A(v ) ⊆ P, containing
i i
the set of projects that he or she approves (see, for example, the work of Fairstein et al. [2023a]
for a discussion of other ballot formats). Note that a voter may approve projects whose total cost
exceeds the available budget. We often refer to the voters and their approval ballots as either an

expectmanyofthem(see,forexample,theworkofXia[2021]foradiscussionofthelikelihoodof
tiesinlargeordinalelections).
Participatory Budgeting Rules. A PB rule is a function f that for some PB instance E =
(P,V,B,cost) outputs a set f(E) ⊆ P of projects, with total cost not exceeding the budget. We
refer to the projects in f(E) as winning (or, alternatively, as selected or funded). Note that our
rules are resolute, that is, their outcomes are unique. We focus on the following rules, denoting
byE =(P,V,B,cost)theinstanceweconsider:
BasicAV. It starts with W = ∅ and considers all the projects in the order of their nonincreasing
approval scores (with ties broken using ≻), inserting a considered project p into W if cost(W ∪
{p})≤B.Whendone,itoutputsW.
AV/Cost. It is like BasicAV, except that for each project p it computes its approval-to-cost ra-
tio|A(p)|/cost(p)andconsiderstheprojectsinthenonincreasingorderofthesevalues.
Phragme´n. Phragme´n starts with W = ∅ and fills it as follows. Initially, the voters have empty
virtualbankaccounts,buttheycontinuouslyearnmoneyattherateofoneunitofbudgetperone
unitoftime.Whenthereisaprojectpsuchthatthevoterswhoapproveithavecost(p)fundsand
the project is within the remaining budget (that is, cost(W ∪{p}) ≤ B), these voters purchase
it, that is, p is included in W, the bank accounts of voters in A(p) are reset to zero, and p is
removedfromconsideration.Ifcost(W∪{p})>B,thenpisremovedfromconsiderationwithout
being included in W. If several projects could be purchased simultaneously, the rule picks one
3using the tie-breaking order. The rule stops and outputs W when all projects are removed from
consideration.3
MethodofEqualShares(MES-Cost). First,eachvoterreceivesthesameamountB/|V|ofmoney.
ThenweletW = ∅andproceediteratively:Withineachiteration,foreachprojectpnotinW we

If no such value exists (that is, the voters approving p cannot afford it) then we set α = ∞. If

So,whileinMES-Costtheaffordabilitycoefficientsarebetween0and1,underMES-Aprtheycan

4 Participatory Budgeting Cost Games
Inthissectionwedefineourmainobjectofstudy,participatorybudgetingcostgames(PBgames).
Formally,aPBgameisatuple(P,V,B,d),whereP isasetofprojects,V isacollectionofvoters
with approval preferences over the projects from P, B is the available budget, and d: P → R
+
is a function that associates each project with its minimal delivery cost (see the description of the
payoffs in the next paragraph). We assume that for each project p , d(p ) ≤ B. In this game, the
i i
projectsaretheplayersandeachofthemneedstoreportitscost.Thatis,astrategyprofileisatuple
c = (c ,...,c ), with a cost c ∈ R for each project p . As is standard, we write (c ,c′) to
1 n i + i −i
denote a strategy profile that is identical to c except that project p reports cost c′. We often write
i
c(p )todenotethecostreportedbyp understrategyprofilec(andweusestrategyprofilesascost
i i
functionsinPBinstances).
LetusfixaPBrulef andaPBgameG = (P,V,B,d).Forastrategyprofilec,theassociated
PBinstanceisE(c)=(P,V,B,c)andthepayoff ofeachprojectp ∈P is:
i
(cid:40) (cid:0) (cid:1)

u (c)= i i i
i
0 otherwise.
Theinterpretationisasfollows:Eachprojectphasaminimaldeliverycostd(p),whichisthelowest
price under which it can be implemented. Yet, with more money the project can be better and the
proposer prefers this. Our utility costs are defined to implement this preference. In particular, the
proposers do not receive funds equal to the utility values. As a special case, we often consider
deliverycostsequaltozero.
ForaPBrulef andaPBgameG=(P,V,B,d),weareinterestedwhetherthisgamehasNash

words, no project has a profitable deviation, that is, it cannot benefit by reporting a different cost

Example 1. Take AV/Cost and a PB game with projects p , p , voters v ,...,v , budget 10, and

From time to time we use specific approval-to-delivery-cost (A/D) tie-breaking orders, which

for any tie-breaking order. When such statements are difficult to show, we seek instances with no
equilibria for some tie-breaking order. Such an observation is weaker than a result of type (3), is
incomparabletoaresultoftype(2),andimpliesthataresultoftype(1)doesnotexist.Pragmatically,
it is most important to know whether a result of type (1) holds or not in a given setting; the other
typesofresultsindicatevariouslevelsofbadnewsthatwemaybefacingregardingtheexistenceof
Nashequilibria.
We are interested in strategy profiles that are proportional in some way (for a discussion of
fairnessinPBsee,forexample,theworksofBrilletal.[2023]andMalyetal.[2023],aswellasthe
worksdefiningMESandPhragme´n).Belowwedefineabasictypeofsuchaprofile,whereproject
costsareproportionaltothenumbersofapprovalstheyget.
Definition 6 (Approval-Proportional Strategy Profile). Consider a PB game with projects P =
{p ,p ,...,p }. We say that strategy profile ap is approval-proportional if for each project p it
1 2 m
holdsthatap(p)=B· |A(p)| .
(cid:80) p′∈P|A(p′)|
Under plurality preferences, the approval-proportional profile is a natural solution for rules fo-
cused on proportionality. For more involved settings, other profiles may be more appropriate (see,
forinstance,MES-CostandTheorem2).
BasicAV

Proposition 1. For each PB game and each internal tie-breaking order ≻, there is a BasicAV-NE
wheretheprojectwithmostapprovals(bestwithrespectto≻)reportscostB.
In fact, we can additionally observe that the most popular project reports the cost B (and is
selected)undereveryBasicAV-NE.Hence,Proposition1indicatesthatproposersofprojectsreceiv-
ing many approvals have incentive to overstate their costs. Furthermore, proposers of smaller, less
popularprojects,haveanincentivetobundlethemtogether(indeed,insomecitiesonecanobserve
projects of the form “improvement of infrastructure in areas X, Y, and Z,” which suggests such
bundling). So, unsurprisingly, BasicAV equilibria in our games are disproportional, highlighting
knowndeficienciesofthisrule.

MethodofEqualShares
The mechanics of MES might appear similar to those of Phragme´n, as all these rules implement
theapproachinwhichvotersbuytheprojectstheyapprove.However,contrarytoPhragme´n,inboth
typesofMESvotershavelimitedamountsofbudgettospend.Hence,theapprovalscoresofprojects
give upper-bounds on the maximum costs that the projects might report. That is, since each voter
gets an equal share of the budget, projects that cost more than the total budget of their supporters
wouldneverbefunded.

For MES-Apr, the situation is more complicated, as an equilibrium may not exist even for a

as the supremum of the set of costs under which p is funded. Then, if p is winning in E under f,

cost(p)−br(p).
InFigure2weshowthewinningandlosingmargins(and,hence,thebestresponses)forallthe
projects from our two PB instances. For BasicAV, we observe very high winning margins for the
projects with the largest numbers of approvals, and close-to-zero best responses for the remaining
ones (this phenomenon is particularly visible in Kleine Wereld). In principle, under BasicAV if
a project receives few votes even making it cheap will not make it funded, unless it is so cheap
that it is selected simply because nothing else could fit within the budget left. For AV/Cost the
bestresponsesroughlycorrespondtothenumbersofapprovalseachprojectgot;thesome,roughly,
holds for Phragme´n and MES-Apr/Ph. The margins for MES-Cost/Ph are significantly different.
Inparticular,forMES-Cost/Ph,severalmost-approvedprojectsusuallyhavemuchhigherwinning
marginsthantherest,unlikeforAV/Cost,Phragme´nandMES-Apr/Ph.
The main general observation is that unless a project received relatively few approvals, then
typicallyitsproposerscouldhavereportedamuchhighercost.Thissuggeststhattheyshouldchoose
reasonable project costs that get their projects completed, rather than minimize the costs as much
as possible, with the hope that this would improve their chances. Yet, of course, there are projects
whereloweringtheircostscouldgetthemfunded(see,e.g,Figure2andthefirstprojectforWesola
underAV/Cost,Phragme´n,orMES-Apr/Ph).
FindingEquilibriaUsingDynamics
In the second experiment, our goal was to compute (approximate) equilibria for our two instances
under our rules. While for BasicAV, AV/Cost, and MES-Cost/Ph we could compute the equilibria
usingresultsfromtheprevioussection,5thiswouldnotbepossibleforPhragme´nandMES-Apr/Ph.

Themainconclusionfromthisexperiment(supportedalsobysimulationsforotherPBinstances;

to use costs that mostly reflect the number of approvals they receive. Under MES-Cost/Ph, most

Weviewthisobservationasoneofthemoreimportanttake-homemessagesfromourwork,which
can be used to favor MES-Cost/Ph in practice (while funding some cheap projects is important,
funding only such projects is logistically problematic for cities, as it requires significant effort in

128 Conclusion
We have introduced a game-theoretic framework capturing strategic cost selection of projects in
participatory budgeting scenarios. Focusing on BasicAV, AV/Cost, Phragme´n, and MES rules, we
explored the conditions under which NE exist in such games. Then, using real-life election data,
weexploredtheeffectsofiterative,profitablechangesinprojects’costs.Webelievetohavesetthe
groundworkforfurthertheoreticalandexperimentalstudybasedonourframework.Weenvisiona
number of directions for future work. One is a natural computational question of establishing the
complexity of deciding if equilibria exist in our games. Further, studying a more involved class
of games emerging from relaxing our basic assumptions seems a very interesting and promising
research avenue. In particular, it is compelling to verify whether the increased model complexity
stillleadstotheobservedphenomena,orratherintroducesnewdynamics.

We argue that strategy c = ap is a AV/Cost-NE. Note that the sum of the reported costs in c
is exactly B and all projects are funded. Hence, for each player, decreasing the cost leads to a
utilityloss.Hence,aprofitabledeviationcouldonlybethroughincreasingthereportedcost.Towards
contradiction, let us fix some player p ∈ ap and assume that reporting a cost c′ > c leads to a

better payoff. This means that p is funded in the modified election E′ = (P,V,B,(c ,c′)) ,
i −i i
that is, p ∈ AV/cost(E′). Additionally, since by Proposition 2 we know that (cid:80) c = B,
i j∈|P| j
it immediately follows that c′ +(cid:80) c > B > (cid:80) c . It is also the case that for
i j∈|P|\{i} j j∈|P|\{i} j
eachj ∈ |P|,|A(Pj)|/cj > |A(Pi)|/c′ i.Hence,inparticular,intherunofAV/costforE′,allprojects

We now argue that every strategy profile c other than ap is not a AV/cost-NE. To this end,
we take such a profile c and assume towards contradiction that it is a AV/cost-NE. Observe that
since c ̸= ap, there exist two distinct projects p
i
and p
j
such that |A(pi)|/ci ̸= |A(pj)|/cj. Hence
one of the projects is considered earlier than the other; we assume without loss of generality that
p is considered before p . Notably, as c is (by our assumption) a AV/cost-NE, by Proposition 2,
i j
we know that {p ,p } ⊆ AV/cost(c). This implies, however, that p can report a slightly higher

least one element is removed from P in every iteration of the loop. Consequently, the algorithm

indeedholds.
ProofofClaim1. We provide an inductive argument over the iterations of the while loop of Al-
gorithm 1. For the sake of the argument’s simplicity, instead of thinking of AV/Cost considering
projectsinnonincreasingorderofapproval-to-costratio,wesaythatitconsidersprojectsinnonde-
creasing order of cost-to-approval ratio. We note that these two interpretations are equivalent. We
takethefirstiterationoftheloopasthebasecaseandsubsequentlyshowthatItems1to5hold.
Item 1. We first show that each p ∈ top (k) is funded in election E(c). Let us denote as
P′
t(p)theratioc(p)/|A(p)|.DuetoLine9andthefollowingforeachloop,weknowthateveryproject
intop (k)istiedtobeconsideredbyAV/Costduetothesamecost-to-approvalratioT.So,ifk =
P′
|P′|, then all projects in P = P are tied for consideration. Since, by Line 9 all project costs sum
p
17up to B∗ = B, the claim holds. We follow assuming that k < |P′|. In this case, Line 9 shows
that p∗ has cost-to-approval ratio t(p∗) ≥ T. Recall that ≻ orders projects nondecreasingly with
respect to their cost-to-approval ratio assuming c and that c differs from c only in strategies of
0 0
projects in top (k). Hence, p∗ precedes in c each project except of those in top (k) and all
P′ P′
projects in top (k) are considered before p∗ (the latter holds even in the case of t(p∗) = T due
P′
to ≻). Eventually, Line 9 guarantees that the cost of all projects in top (k) does not exceed the
P′
budget.Knowingthat,weshowthatnoprojectintop (k)hasaprofitabledeviationinc.Toprove

Thus,wehaveestablishedthebasecaseandwemoveontotheinductionstep.Considerx > 1
and the x-th iteration of the while loop, assuming that the base case claims are met for the (x−
1)-th iteration. Due to the assumptions for the (x−1)-th iteration together with the fact that our
algorithmneverchangestheorder≻inwhichAV/Costconsidersprojectsandthatitneverconsiders
the same project twice, we can ignore all projects processed in previous (x−1) iterations of the
while loop. Clearly, the ignored projects will have no impact on the current loop iteration except
for decreasing the value of the variable B∗ representing the remaining budget. Consequently, the
arguments for Items 1 to 4 carry on without changes for the xth iteration of the while loop. The
claimfromItem5,however,needsmoreattention.LetQ(x−1) = P \P(x−1) bethesetofplayers

it would be beneficial for p′ to slightly increase its cost, but so that time(p′) would still be

below p′. Then, irrespective in what order are the other projects funded, p′’s voter would

collect enough money to purchase p′ before the p′’s voter would, and p′ would be bought

if we had time(p′) < time(p′) = time(p′) then it would be beneficial for p′ to report

and c∗(p′′) = 3·time′′. We claim that time′ = time′′. Indeed, let us consider what happens if

time′ < time′′ (the case where time′′ < time′ is symmetric). There are two cases two consider
(thesecondcasealsosplitsintotwo).
Case A First, let us assume that at least one of p′ and p′ is preferred to p′ by the tie-breaking
1 2 3

Case B′ The second case is that p′ is preferred by tie-breaking to both p′ and p′. Then it is

beneficial for p′ to slightly increase its cost. Again, let us consider how Phragme´n operates after

Our algorithm constructs the strategy c step by step maintaining the collection V′ of voters to

of Steps 1-4. In what follows we show that in each Nash equilibrium MES-Cost selects exactly

As a result, Claim 2 holds at the i-th stage, which we consider. Thanks to this, we apply an anal-
ogous exchange argument (pretending that voters outside of V′ do not exist) to that for the base
case to show that indeed p∗ has to be selected at the i-th stage. Then, we directly repeat the ar-

ProofofTheorem4
Proof. Let(P,N,B,d)beaMES-AprPBgamewithparty-listballotsandzerodeliverycosts.
At the beginning, each voter receives B/|V| money. In a party-list profile, as every two voters

i i
23supportersofparty(p i)haveisM(party(p i))=|A(p i)|·B/|V|= |A( |p Vi) ||·B.Therefore,theprojects
in party(p ) need to somehow distribute this money between them in such a way that no project

Sincewehavecardinalutilities,theα-valueofprojectp isinitiallyα (p )= c(pi) .For

For this reason, for the profile c where each project says c(p ) = M(party(pi)), we obtain

ProofofTheorem5
Proof. Let (P,V,B,d) be a MES-Apr PB game with party-list ballots. Recall that at the begin-
ning each voter receives B/|V| money. Then, the total money the supporters of party(p i) have is
M(party(p i))=|A(p i)|·B/|V|= |A( |p Vi) ||·B.

Due to symmetry, w.l.o.g. we can assume that 1) project p says the lowest cost (i.e., c(p ) ≤

Wepointoutthatifthereisnoprojectofthesamecostasp ,thenp couldhaveincreasedits

Withourassumptions,projectp isselectedinthefirstiterationandeachofitssupporterspays

c(p 51) for p 1. As b− c( 5pi) ≤ 1B 6 − 3 1 5B 6 = 2 1 5B 6 < 3 1 5B 6 ≤ c( 5pj) for any p i,p j ∈ P, voter v 1 has

notethatα 2(p 2)= c(p2)−(b 4−c(p 51)) ≥ c(p1)−( 1B 46−c(p 51)) = 6c 2(p 01) − 6B

projectp wouldregretsayingthesamecostasprojectp .Indeed,selectingp inthefirstiteration

itcannotbethecasethatc(p )=c(p ),soduetotheformerreasoningweknowthatc(p )=c(p )
1 4 1 2
andc(p )<c(p ).
1 4
So we know that: c(p ) = c(p ), c(p ) < c(p ), and c(p ) ≤ c(p ). We have two cases to
1 2 1 4 2 3
consider:
• Projectp isselectedintheseconditeration.Itmeansthatα (p )≤α (p ).Weobservethat
4 2 4 2 2
it must be α (p ) = α (p ), otherwise it would be beneficial for p to slightly increase its
2 4 2 2 4
costbyϵinsuchawaythatp isstillconsideredbeforep andgainsmore.
4 2
In this case, as p and p are approved by disjoint sets of voters and both p and p took
2 3 1 4
thesameamountofmoneyfromthesamenumberoftheirsupporters,bothp andp should
2 3
request for the same amount of money, that is, all money that their supporters have. Thus
c(p ) = c(c ) = 3 · b + (b − c(p1)) + (b − c(p4)) = 5b − c(p1) − c(p4) and c(p ) =
3 2 5 5 5 5 4
5·(5b− c(p1) −c(p ))=25b−5c(p )−c(p ).
5 2 2 1
However, we know that c(p ) = c(p ), so c(p ) = c(p ) = c(p ) = 5b− c(p1) − c(p4),
1 2 1 2 3 5 5
which implies that c(p ) = 25b−5c(p )−c(p ) = 25b−6c(p ). Therefore, α (p ) =
4 2 1 1 2 4
α 2(p 2)meansthat c(p 54) = c(p2)−(b 4−c(p 51)) = 6c 2(p 01)− 4b,whichisequivalentto 25b−6 5c(p1) =
6c(p1)−5b ⇒ 100b−24c(p ) = 6c(p )−5b ⇒ 30c(p ) = 105b ⇒ c(p ) = 7b.Thenwe
20 1 1 1 1 2
havec(p )=c(p )=c(p )= 7b andc(p )=25b−6c(p )=25b−21b=4b.
1 2 3 2 4 1
Now imagine that project p changes its cost from c(p ) = 7b to c′(p ) = 36b. Naturally,

thatα 2(p 2) = c(p2)−(b 4−c(p 51)) = 6c 2(p 01) − 4b,soα 2(p 4) = α 2(p 2) ⇒ c(p 54) = 6c 2(p 01) − 4b ⇒

increase its cost by ϵ in such a way that c(p ) + ϵ < c(p ) and still be selected in

Therefore, c(p ) = 6c(p1)−5b = 55b−6c(p1) ⇒ 30c(p )−25b = 110b−12c(p ) ⇒
