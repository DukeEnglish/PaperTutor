Abstract: Addressing the challenge of managing human-centric and integrative lighting in public libraries,
especially post-installation, requires balancing complex visual and non-visual light effects. Current standards may
overlook varied user needs and environmental contexts, potentially hindering effective post-installation asset
management and digitalization efforts. To solve this problem, this paper proposes the context driven Critical
Integrative Levels (CIL), a novel approach to lighting asset management in public libraries that aligns with the
transformative vision of human-centric and integrative lighting. This approach encompasses not only the visual
aspects of lighting performance but also prioritizes the physiological and psychological well-being of library users.
With the Global Lighting Association (GLA)’s aim to realize human-centric lighting by 2040, this study contributes
a proactive methodology that goes beyond traditional asset management concerns of functionality and lifespan
to embrace user well-being. Incorporating a newly defined metric, Mean Time of Exposure (MTOE), the approach
quantifies user-light interaction, enabling tailored lighting strategies that respond to diverse activities and needs
in library spaces. Case studies demonstrate how the CIL matrix can be practically applied, offering significant
improvements over conventional methods by focusing on optimized user experiences from both visual impacts
and non-visual effects. Results from this study highlight the study’s implications for future policy and practice in
lighting asset management, anticipating further research to extend the scope and impact of human-centric
lighting in line with industry forecasts.

1. Introduction
“Human-centric lighting” [1, 2], more broadly recognized as “integrative lighting” [3], is specifically
designed to positively influence human physiology and psychology. This encompasses both visual
aspects—such as light intensity, flicker, glare, and colour temperature—and non-visual impacts,
including biological and emotional advantages like circadian rhythm synchronization and heightened
alertness [4, 5]. The Global Lighting Association (GLA) has charted a strategic roadmap toward the
realization of human-centric lighting by 2040 [1]. This study, supported by the Swedish Energy Agency,
seeks to pioneer advancements in human-centric and integrative lighting asset management, which
aims to promote effective lighting and to help the users get the right light at the right time to support
various activities, with public libraries serving as the illustrative context.
Contrasting with traditional asset management’s focus on functionality, cost-efficiency, and asset
longevity, human-centric and integrative asset management centralizes human well-being in its
decision-making processes. It seeks to refine technical specifications to bolster human health and
wellness [6] [7].
Today, public libraries are transitioning from mere repositories of books to hubs of learning. Indoor
lighting quality in such venues doesn’t just influence physical health, like vision, but also factors into
mental well-being, influencing moods and productivity [8] [9]. A pressing challenge within the domain

1of public library lighting asset management is how to manage human-centric and integrative lighting
assets, particular in post-installation stage, given the increasing requirements and complexity involved
when combining the visual and non-visual effects of light [6] [7].
Using illuminance as an example, preliminary investigations within a single public library demonstrate
that the health status of a lighting asset can be assessed by comparing real-time measurements against
established norms and guidelines [7]. Specifically, the disparity between these real-time measurements
and the normative values offers a quantifiable basis for identifying potential health risks (see Table.1 in
[7]). Such a methodology not only permits the establishment of anomaly detection alerts but also
enhances diagnostic and prognostic efforts, laying the groundwork for developing key performance
indicators (KPIs) and enabling effective monitoring and forecasting strategies. This method would
further facilitate the digitalization and visualization of lighting asset management through the
implementation of digital twins, thereby enhancing resource/energy efficiency and decision-making
processes. However, these efforts represent merely the initial phase. The problem lies in the fact that
current thresholds in the above preliminary investigations are established solely based on standard
recommendations, neglecting the diverse contexts (e.g., ages of the users, various activities,
geographic locations, and seasonal changes, etc.) required to fulfil the demands of human-centric and
integrative lighting asset management [7]. Even though we would assume that most lighting design are
qualified to be human-centric and integrative, this oversight could still lead to inappropriate in
operation and maintenance in post-installation stage of lighting assets [6]; and as the process of
digitalization and visualization evolves, it will become obstacle of moving forward to realizing the
human-centric and integrative asset management.
To address the above problem, this study introduces the concept of Mean Time of Exposure (MTOE)
and proposes a novel, context-driven Critical Integrative Levels (CIL) for the management of lighting
assets in public libraries. Furthermore, it establishes and delineates context-specific thresholds for
crucial lighting parameters, situated within the domain of human-centric and integrative lighting asset
management. Through the implementation of the proposed context-driven CIL, decision-making
processes are oriented to prioritize human well-being, thereby assisting public libraries in advancing
toward the objective of facilitating human centric and integrative lighting. This ensures users receive
the appropriate lighting performance at the precise time necessary to support a variety of activities.
Following the introduction, the structure of this paper is arranged to explore and elucidate the
intricacies of human-centric and integrative lighting asset management in public libraries, guided by
the proposed Critical Integrative Levels (CIL) and the concept of Mean Time of Exposure (MTOE).
Chapter 2 lays the groundwork with an identification of key performance parameters and contexts of
lighting in public libraries. Chapter 3 delves into the MTOE and CIL, highlighting their integration to
refine management practices. Chapter 4 discusses the establishment of context-specific CIL thresholds,
enriched with illustrative examples. Chapter 5 transitions to the practical application of the CIL
framework through case studies, Chapter 6 discusses the principal findings from our studies, focusing
on the degradation of key lighting parameters, nuances of Equivalent Melanopic Lux (EML),
comparative measurements across different seasons and libraries, and the intricacies of energy
efficiency. Chapter 7 provides the conclusion together with future work. This compact structure aims
to offer a comprehensive yet concise exploration of innovative strategies for managing lighting assets
in the public libraries, emphasizing human well-being and operational efficiency.
22. Background: Lighting Parameters and Contexts in Public Libraries
Chapter 2 provides essential lighting parameters identified on its performance measurement to public
libraries and describes the typical lighting contexts these institutions encounter. This sets the stage for
a deeper understanding of the contents in Chapter 3 and 4.
2.1 Identification of key lighting parameters on its performance measurement
This section identifies key parameters that reflect the performance of lighting, which refer to:
illuminance, glare, colour rendering, colour temperature, flicker, chromaticity, photobiological safety,
Equivalent Melanopic Lux (EML), energy efficiency, life span, and other factors. More sub parameters
are listed in Table 2.1 (also briefly illustrated by Figure 1 in [6]). These parameters provide a
comprehensive view of a lighting system’s performance and how well it meets the needs and
preferences of users. Standards for acceptable levels of most of these parameters are set by
organizations like the Illuminating Engineering Society (IES) and the International Electrotechnical
Commission (IEC). An overview of those key lighting parameters on its performance measurement is
presented:
• Illuminance is a fundamental lighting performance parameter that measures the amount of
light incident on a surface. It is expressed in lux (lx), where one lux is equal to one lumen per
square meter. This parameter is crucial as it directly relates to how well a task can be visually
performed, and it influences comfort and productivity. Related indices to illuminance help in
determining the effectiveness and suitability of a lighting system for a given space and task
requirements. They are important for assessing visibility, ensuring comfort, and promoting
energy efficiency.
• Glare is a significant lighting performance parameter which refers to the discomfort or
impairment of vision a person can experience when parts of their visual field are much brighter
than the level to which their eyes are adapted. Glare can be detrimental to both comfort and
safety, especially in tasks that require precision and focus. Related indices to glare help in
assessing and mitigating the negative impacts of glare in various lighting situations. They are
important in maintaining visual comfort and ensuring that lighting systems are designed and
installed in a way that minimizes glare.
• Colour rendering refers to how accurately a light source reveals the colour s of objects, people,
and surroundings in comparison to a natural light source (usually sunlight). The quality of
colour rendering can greatly impact the appearance of a space and the activities within it.
Related indices to colour rendering help in choosing the appropriate light source for various
applications where the appearance of colour is critical, such as retail, art galleries, healthcare
facilities, and more.
• Colour temperature is a measure that describes the spectral characteristics of a white light
source, particularly the “warm” or “cool” qualities of the light. The colour temperature of a
light source is determined by comparing its hue with a theoretical, heated black-body radiator.
The temperature at which the heated black-body radiator matches the hue of the light source
is the light’s colour temperature, measured in degrees Kelvin (K). Related indices to colour
temperature help in choosing the appropriate light source for various applications where the
colour temperature plays a significant role, such as mood setting, light satisfaction and
aesthetic purposes in interior design, film, and photography, and many more.
3• Flicker is a rapid change in brightness of a light source over time. It is often caused by
fluctuations in the electrical power supply. High levels of flicker can cause discomfort, fatigue,
and even seizures in individuals with photosensitive epilepsy. Even at levels that are
undetectable to the human eye, flicker can cause headaches and visual impairment. Related
indices to flicker help in evaluating and minimizing the flicker in a lighting system, thereby
ensuring visual comfort, and minimizing potential health risks.
• Chromaticity describes the specific colour of a light, independent of its luminance. It is usually
represented in a two-dimensional chromaticity diagram, where each point corresponds to a
specific colour. Related indices to chromaticity help in choosing the appropriate light source for
various applications where the exact colour of the light is important, such as film and
photography, retail, museums, and galleries, and more.
• Photobiological Safety refers to the potential risk of photochemical damage to the eye caused
by electromagnetic radiation from light sources. The primary wavelengths of interest are the
visible blue region between 400 nm and 500 nm. While modern LED light sources emit
negligible amount of UV (Ultraviolet) or IR (Infrared radiation), the small size combined with
substantial blue emission causes a high blue light hazard. The evaluation and classification are
described in EN 62471 [10] and is required for luminaires installed in workplaces within EU
through EU directive [11].
• Equivalent Melanopic Lux (EML) is a crucial metric for assessing the impact of light on human
health, focusing on its influence on circadian rhythms, sleep, and cognitive functions [12] [13].
It reflects the interaction of light with the eye’s photoreceptors, particularly the melanopsin-
containing intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), which play a vital role in
regulating emotions, alertness, and body temperature. Disruptions in ipRGC function due to
inappropriate artificial lighting can result in sleep and mood disorders, among other health
issues.
• Energy efficiency in lighting refers to the amount of light produced per unit of energy consumed.
It is a crucial parameter in the design and operation of lighting systems, as improving energy
efficiency can significantly reduce energy costs and environmental impacts. Related indices to
energy efficiency help to evaluate and compare the energy efficiency of different lighting
systems and to design lighting systems that minimize energy consumption and costs.
• The lifespan of a lighting source refers to the duration of its operation until it reaches a point
where it can no longer perform its function adequately. It is a crucial factor when considering
the cost, maintenance, and environmental impact of lighting systems. Related indices to
lifespan help in planning the maintenance and replacement schedule of a lighting system, as
well as in calculating the total cost of ownership, which includes not only the initial cost of the
light source but also the costs of energy and maintenance over its operational life.
• Other Factors related to Luminaire: A luminaire, also known as a light fixture, is a complete
lighting unit that includes a light source or light sources along with the parts designed to
distribute the light, to position and protect the light sources, and to connect the light sources
to the power supply. These indices help in selecting the appropriate luminaire for a particular
application, considering both the lighting requirements and the energy efficiency.
2.2 Lighting contexts encountered in public libraries and their impact
A context-driven approach in human-centric and integrative lighting asset management, particularly
within public libraries, is pivotal for addressing the unique spectrum of challenges, user needs, and
4specific conditions inherent in such settings [7]. This approach acknowledges that libraries are not
monolithic; they are dynamic environments influenced by a variety of factors. These factors, as detailed
in previous studies and encapsulated [7], fall into several distinct categories: 1) External Environmental
Factors, which include the impact of natural light and weather conditions; 2) Interior Design Factors,
which pertain to the architectural layout and aesthetic considerations; 3) User Factors, focusing on the
demographic diversity and the varying needs of library patrons; 4) Cost Factors, concerning budgetary
limitations and economic efficiency; and 5) Regulation Factors, which involve compliance with legal and
safety standards.
The human-centric and integrative approach to lighting asset management should acknowledge and
cater to the varied needs of these demographic segments. For example, lighting requirements often
differ across age groups. In sections of the library such as the magazine and newspaper area, which
older adults commonly use, lighting with higher illuminance levels proves more suitable. Similarly,
distinct activities necessitate unique lighting conditions. Reading, for instance, demands concentrated,
brighter illumination, whereas social gatherings may be enhanced by softer, more diffuse lighting.
Additionally, considering the library as a workplace for librarians introduces further lighting
considerations. Task-specific lighting must be implemented in areas like the circulation desk and office
spaces to reduce eye strain and improve efficiency. Ergonomic lighting design can also support
librarians’ health and productivity, highlighting the need for a multifaceted approach to lighting that
considers the diverse roles a library plays for patrons and staff alike. For libraries situated in high-
latitude areas of Sweden (above 55° N), the need for artificial lighting varies significantly with the
seasons, attributable to the abundance of daylight in summer and prolonged darkness in winter.
Consequently, this necessitates the adoption of diverse operational strategies to accommodate these
seasonal variations in lighting requirements.
Understanding and recognizing these contexts is not merely beneficial but foundational to the process
of lighting asset management in libraries. By thoroughly grasping the specific situations, settings, or
environments, stakeholders can devise and implement a management approach that is not only
tailored but also responsive to these diverse influences. This ensures that lighting solutions are not only
technically viable but also human-centric, enhancing the user experience by meeting the specific needs
dictated by these varied contexts.
In the preliminary framework of lighting asset management, the context-driven approach can offer
essential guidance for establishing practical thresholds for the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) of
lighting assets during the “Study” stages [7]. This approach is crucial for addressing the issue that
current thresholds, as identified in preliminary investigations, are determined solely based on standard
recommendations. By incorporating a context-driven approach, we can ensure that lighting
management strategies are more aligned with the actual needs and conditions of library environments,
thereby enhancing the effectiveness and relevance of lighting solutions.
In essence, a context-driven approach enables the creation of lighting environments that are adaptable,
efficient, and conducive to the multifaceted functions of modern public libraries, thereby underscoring
its importance in the realm of library management. Additionally, our study adopts a dynamic approach
to setting context-driven thresholds, which are not established as fixed, singular values but rather as a
flexible matrix. This matrix is designed to adapt and meet the evolving requirements of human-centric
and integrative lighting asset management. For more detailed information, please refer to Chapter 3.
53. Novel Thresholds: Mean Time of Exposure (MTOE) and the Multidimensional
Critical Integrative Levels (CIL)
Chapter 3 delves into the essence of human-centric and integrative lighting asset management, which
prioritizes human well-being at the core of its decision-making process. This chapter introduces the
novel concept of Mean Time of Exposure (MTOE) and present a novel, context-driven Critical
Integrative Levels (CIL) approach for the effective management of lighting assets in public libraries. This
includes an overview of assumptions and illustrative examples. The emphasis is placed on how the
integration of these concepts can enhance management practices, ensuring that lighting solutions are
not only efficient but also aligned with the specific needs and well-being of library users.
3.1 Mean Time of Exposure (MTOE) and Critical Integrative Levels (CIL)
Mean Time of Exposure (MTOE) is a concept designed to quantify the duration of human exposure to
specified lighting conditions within a particular environment. It measures the average time individuals
spend under these lighting conditions, reflecting the cumulative impact of lighting on human well-being
and comfort. MTOE is a critical indicator in evaluating the suitability and effectiveness of lighting
environments, particularly in spaces (such as public library) where visual tasks are performed or where
lighting significantly influences mood, productivity, and circadian rhythms. MTOE, measured in minutes,
is posited to correlate directly with the significance of a given environment to human well-being; that
is, a larger MTOE indicates a greater importance of the environment to users’ well-being. By assessing
MTOE, stakeholders can make informed decisions to optimize lighting designs and configurations,
ensuring they meet human-centric needs and enhance the overall user experience.
Critical Integrative Levels (CIL) signify the importance of a lighting environment, with a higher CIL
denoting greater significance to human well-being, encompassing both physiological and psychological
aspects. CIL determination integrates Mean Time of Exposure (MTOE) with various contextual factors.
In this research, the innovative concept of CIL is depicted through a matrix that considers the user’s
age and MTOE within a public library setting. This study establishes several assumptions to elucidate
the novel concept of CIL:
Assumption 1: The criticality of an environment is categorized into a higher Critical Integrative Level
(CIL) if the MTOE is 15 minutes or more. Conversely, an MTOE of less than 15 minutes categorizes the
environment into a lower Critical Integrative Level.
• Higher CIL examples include settings such as reading sofas/tables, learning tables, and counters.
• Lower CIL examples encompass areas like bookshelves, digital inquiry tables, and corridors.
Assumption 2: The well-being of users of varying ages is considered differently, affecting lighting
requirements. Environments predominantly used by individuals younger than 12 years or older than
65 years are assigned a higher CIL, reflecting the heightened importance of lighting for these age groups.
3.2 Establishing Thresholds via Context-Driven Critical Integrative Levels (CIL)
This section details a step-by-step methodology for establishing thresholds using the context-driven CIL
approach. The procedure of establishing the thresholds for a single lighting parameter is shown in
below Figure. Note: The target value (T) corresponds to the specifications set by the lighting designer,
which are confirmed prior to the installation of the lighting assets. Typically, target values are set to
achieve higher levels of lighting performance, whereas standard values define the basic acceptable
levels.
6Fig.1 Input, output, and main steps in the procedure of setting context driven thresholds
Step 1: Define the CIL Matrix - The CIL matrix is formulated based on Mean Time of Exposure (MTOE)
and the identified contexts pertinent to the study. For this research, the context in focus is the age of
the users. According to Table 3.1, users under 12 years of age are categorized into Group A, those over
65 into Group C, and all other users into Group B. Following Assumption 1 from section 3.1, an MTOE
of less than 5 minutes is classified as T1, more than 15 minutes as T3, and durations in between as T2.
Within this framework, CIL-I denotes a higher priority level than CIL-II. Specifically, CIL-I is assigned to
Group A - T3, indicating a high Critical Integrative Level for lighting environments predominantly used
by users younger than 12 for periods longer than 15 minutes, such as a children’s reading area.
Table 3.1 Context driven CIL matrix: an example.
Younger than 12 Between (12, 65) Older than 65
MTOE/Ages
(Group A) (Group B) (Group C)
Less than 5 (T1) CIL-II CIL-II CIL-II
Between [5 – 15] (T2) CIL-I CIL-II CIL-I
Longer than 15 (T3) CIL-I CIL-I CIL-I
Step 2: Determining the CILs for the Examined Lighting Environment – This step involves identifying
the Critical Integrative Levels (CILs) across the entire lighting environment under study, which, in this
case, is the public library. As illustrated in Table 3.2, this process entails analysing the specific sub-
environments of lighting assets within the library and their primary users, identifying the age groups of
these users and their Mean Time of Exposure (MTOE). Utilizing the outcomes from the previous step,
the appropriate CILs for each sub-environment are then established based on these factors.
Step 3: Defining Intervals for the degrees of the Health Status Using the CIL Matrix - The health status
of each lighting parameter (as discussed in Section 2.1) can be classified into varying degrees based on
the CIL matrix. These degrees, corresponding to different CILs, determine the interval or range for each
health status. An illustrative example is provided in Table 3.3, where, for instance, the health status (HS)
of illuminance is categorized into five degrees, from HS1 to HS5, with HS5 being the optimal status. In
the table, a 0% indication means that the actual value meets the requirements of standard limits (S).
7Target (T) values determined by the designer, which are set to achieve higher levels of lighting
performance. It is important to recognize that exceeding necessary lighting values can lead to resource
inefficiency, therefore the optimal achievable status is HS4, not HS5, to prevent wasteful over-
illumination. Detailed intervals for the health status of lighting parameters are discussed in Chapter 4.
For parameters where a higher level indicates superior performance, such as HS5 being better than
HS4, HS5 is highlighted in dark blue.

HS4 [T, 150%*T] [T, 120%T]
HS5 (150%*T, +∞) (120%T, +∞)
Step 4 Establishes the thresholds based on contact driven CIL matrix for the examined lighting
environment – Based on the health status intervals set up in Step 3 and the target values for key lighting
parameters in specified lighting environment, establishes the thresholds for each status. Take
illuminance as example (see Table 3.3), for environments classified under CIL-I, the health status range
is set to HS5, with the parameter’s target value falling within a range of [T, 150%*T). Conversely, for
CIL-II environments, the range is narrowed to [T, 120%*T). Target (T) values are typically established
during the design phase by the lighting designers; however, in the absence of specific design data,
standard values are used as benchmarks. This differentiation underscores the higher priority of CIL-I
over CIL-II, reflected through broader health status intervals. Table 3.4 presents some examples of
setting thresholds of 𝐸̅ in the public library based on the above CIL matrix in Table 3.3, in which we
𝑚
assume the Target Value (T) is about 20% higher than the Standard value (S).

84. A Guide on Context driven Thresholds for Key Lighting Parameters
Following the approaches proposed in chapter 3, Chapter 4 provides the thresholds established in the
project for recommended key lighting parameters for monitoring and diagnostics. The recommended
parameters are selected from the identified key parameters in Chapter 2 (Table.2.1), which provides a
guide on setting context driven thresholds considering the needs on human centric and integrative
lighting, requirement of standards, as well as target value from the lighting designers. These
parameters (listed in Table.4.1) are recommended for lighting performance measurement in public
libraries for the purpose of monitoring and diagnostics. Some of the applications will be illustrated with
case studies in Chapter 5.

Illumination parameters should be in proximity of Target Value (T) to ensure a balanced lighting design
throughout the library. Higher levels indicated as HS4 in 𝐸̅ will lessen energy efficiency. Based on
𝑚
Standard SS-EN 12464-1 [14], Table 3.2 and Table 3.3, a guide on context driven threshold of 𝐸̅ can
𝑚
be found in Table 4.1.1., in which we assume the target (T) value, where T (𝐸̅ )= S (𝐸̅ )+100, as shown

in the Tabel 4.1.2. For 𝑈 , we assume that T (𝑈 )=S (𝑈 )+0.1. A 𝑈 of 1, which eliminates all shadows,
0 0 0 0
could create a very clinical and monotonous atmosphere if applied throughout an entire library.
Currently, we are using higher ratios only in specific areas such as sofas or tables to enhance those
spaces. It's important to clarify that we are not advocating for a uniformity ratio of 1 across the entire
library, as this might not provide the best aesthetic or functional outcome.
4.2 A guide on thresholds of glare: 𝑈𝐺𝑅

Glare needs to be avoided to ensure a good working environment. A glare rating lower than standard
is desired. Based on Standard SS-EN 12464-1 [14], the variables are between 10 (best) -30 (worst). A
guide on context driven threshold of 𝑈𝐺𝑅 can be found in Table 4.2.1.

94.4 A guide on thresholds of colour temperature: CCT and DUV
The colour appearance of a light source refers to the apparent colour (chromaticity) of the light emitted.
It is quantified by its correlated colour temperature (CCT). The choice of colour appearance of the light
is a matter of psychology, aesthetics and what is preferred. Lighting sources need to stay in proximity
to target to ensure a pleasant environment. The CCT is regulated by the lighting designer. While
standard such as SS-EN 12464-1 [14] has only recommendations for special conditions (not for libraries).
In this study, we make suggestions including:
• For General Reading Areas, the average CCT could be 3500 K. The reason is that a neutral to
cool white colour temperature helps in maintaining alertness and reduces eye strain, which is
beneficial for reading and writing.
• For Children’s Sections, the average CCT could be 3300K. The reason is that a warmer colour
temperature creates a welcoming and stimulating environment for children, which can be
more comfortable and less harsh for young eyes.
• For Computer and Learning Table Areas: the average CCT could be 4000 K. The reason is that
cooler white light is preferable where tasks require concentration and detail (such as computer
use and research), as it promotes alertness and efficiency.
• For Relaxation Zones (Sofa, etc.): the average CCT could be 3000K. The reason is that warm
white lighting can make those areas more inviting and relaxing, making it easier for people to
unwind with a book.
Based on the above suggestions, a guide on context driven threshold of CCT can be found in Table 4.4.1.
The DUV value that is considered acceptable for human perception and application requirements can
vary depending on the context and the specific standards applied. In general, for most indoor lighting
applications where colour quality is important, such as in residential or office settings, a DUV value
close to zero is preferred, typically within the range of -0.006 to +0.006 [15]. In this study, a guide on
context driven threshold of CCT can be found in Table 4.4.2. This range ensures that the light colour is
perceived as neutral white, without noticeable green or magenta tints that can be objectionable or
cause discomfort over time.
4.5 A guide on thresholds of flicker parameter: SVM
SVM, the metric used to quantify the risk of stroboscopic effects that can be perceived by humans in a
flickering light source. This is particularly relevant with the widespread use of LED lighting, which, if not
properly controlled, can exhibit pronounced flicker. SVM values typically range from 0 to 1, with 0
indicating no visible stroboscopic effect and 1 indicating a highly noticeable effect. For library
environments, where focused activities such as reading and computer work take place, it is important
to minimize any potential for distraction or discomfort. Based on the Eco-design directive for regulation
of maximum value [11], a guide on context driven threshold of CCT can be found in Table 4.4.2.
4.7 Equivalent Melanopic Lux (EML)
The higher EML, the healthier contribution to the visual environment in the library. In certain settings,
some positive compensations will differ from the dynamics in natural lighting environment. Based on
WELL Standard [16], American National Standards RP-1-12 [17], British Standards Institution PD CEN/TR
16791:2017 [18], DIN/TS 5031-100:2021-11 [19], CIE S 026:2018 [20], A guide on context driven
threshold of EML can be found in Table 4.5.1. Noted, this study takes recommended thresholds from
WELL V2 in which EML is recommended to be>150 EML, while DIN standard generally
recommends >250 EML.

185. Practical Application of the CIL Framework in Public Libraries
Building on the insights and the novel approach from previous chapters, this chapter explores the
practical implementation of the CIL (Critical Integrated Level) framework through detailed case studies
of three Swedish libraries, designated as G, S, and C. These studies, conducted with measurements
taken in February for Library G, and in March and October 2023 for Libraries S and C respectively, utilize
the GL SPECTIS 1.0 touch as the measurement tool (Fig.2).
We have chosen nine key parameters to illustrate the application of the CIL framework, categorized
into visual and non-visual/semi-visual groups. The visual parameters include Illuminance (𝐸̅ in Lux),
𝑚
Colour Rendering Indices𝑅 ,𝑅 , 𝑅 ,𝑅 , SDCM. The non-visual parameters assessed are Correlated
𝑎 9 𝑓 𝑔
Colour Temperature (CCT), Delta Ultraviolet (DUV), Stroboscopic Visibility Measure (SVM), and
Equivalent Melanopic Lux (EML).
To contextualize our findings, we use the health status scale from HS1 to HS5, where HS1 denotes the
worst condition and HS5 represents an extra good condition, as established in Chapter 4. Main findings
from the case studies include:
• Illuminance (Lux):
o Approximately 50% of the measurements across the libraries fall into HS1 or HS2, indicating
illuminance levels significantly below the standard and target values, depicted in red.
o Instances of excessively high illuminance were observed, hinting at potential energy
inefficiencies (highlighted in dark green, HS5), which are further discussed in Chapter 6.
o Illuminance varies significantly with shelf height, with higher shelves typically experiencing
better light levels (HS5), though medium and lower shelves often remain in poor conditions
(HS1).
• Colour Rendering:
o Most data points scored well (HS4) or best (HS5) for colour rendering indices, except for
notable issues with R9, particularly in Library C during conditions of low snow reflectance
(October measurements), where R9 significantly worsened.
• Correlated Color Temperature (CCT):
o CCT values exhibited dependency on the measurement's vertical position, with about 50%
rating as just acceptable or poor (HS2 or HS3), potentially due to inappropriate selection
or degradation of light sources.
• Non-Visual Parameters:
o DUV: The majority of DUV measurements are classified as good (HS4) or acceptable (HS3).
o SVM: Findings for SVM predominantly indicate good (HS4) or extra good conditions (HS5).
o EML: EML calculations, heavily dependent on Lux and CCT, generally revealed less
satisfactory statuses, warranting further discussion in Chapter 6.
This chapter not only demonstrates the practical applications of the CIL framework but also highlights
the complexities and challenges encountered in achieving optimal lighting conditions in library
environments. The varying results across different parameters and conditions underscore the need for
tailored lighting strategies that consider both visual comfort and energy efficiency.

226. Discussions
Building upon the case studies detailed in Chapter 5, this chapter delves into a discussion of the
principal findings from these studies. Our focus centres on the degradation of key lighting parameters,
the nuances of Equivalent Melanopic Lux (EML), a simplified comparison on measurement results from
different seasons and different libraries, and the intricacies of energy efficiency. Each of these elements
plays a pivotal role in shaping the efficacy and sustainability of lighting asset management in public
libraries.
6.1 Key lighting parameters degradation issues
Our analysis has revealed critical areas where lighting performance within public libraries needs urgent
enhancement, specifically concerning Lux, 𝑅 , CCT, and DUV see Table 5.1 – Table5.5. The degradation
9
of these parameters over time significantly impacts the overall effectiveness of lighting systems.
Moreover, the calculations of Equivalent Melanopic Lux (EML) are directly influenced by Lux and CCT
values, suggesting that their degradation adversely affects EML outcomes.
Under the assumption that the initial design and installation being adequate, then the status of
assessing those key lighting parameters shows that Lux, 𝑅 , CCT, and DUV deteriorate with time. This
9
natural progression underscores the necessity of incorporating these parameters into lifetime
predictions and optimizing operational and maintenance strategies to extend the effective lifespan of
lighting installations.
Current standards for defining the reliability of lighting sources, particularly LEDs, are predominantly
cantered on the” L70” benchmark [21]. This metric indicates when the luminous flux of LEDs declines
to 70% of its initial output, traditionally used to estimate the lifespan of LED lighting. However, our
findings advocate for a broader approach. Considering the degradation trends of not just Lux but also
𝑅 , CCT and DUV is crucial as these factors are integral to maintaining optimal lighting conditions and
9
enhancing the EML values.
Additionally, the vertical position’s impact on degradation is notable, with varying degrees of
deterioration observed at different heights within the library spaces. This variation suggests that the
commonly specified measurement height of 0.75 meters [14] may be insufficient to capture the full
scope of spatial lighting behaviour and degradation trends. Expanding the range of measurement
heights could provide a more comprehensive understanding of lighting performance across different
levels of a library’s environment.
Overall, addressing these degradation issues not only involves revisiting maintenance schedules and
operational practices but also calls for a re-evaluation of the metrics used to define lighting reliability
and effectiveness. By broadening the scope of these metrics to include 𝑅 , CCT and DUV alongside Lux,
9
and considering the influence of vertical positioning, library lighting systems can be better maintained
to serve their purpose over longer periods, ensuring both energy efficiency and high-quality
illumination.
6.2 Circadian Rhythms and EML
Daylight emerges as the most effective source of melanopic lux, as evidenced by its spectral
composition and energy efficiency in comparison to artificial lighting sources. Our testing revealed that
the presence of daylight yielded superior performance across various metrics in both visual and non-
visual/semi-visual domains. Notably, daylight serves as a potent circadian stimulus, playing a crucial
role in regulating circadian rhythms, influencing sleep-wake cycles, hormone production, and overall
well-being.
23While the integration of daylight into architectural design is commendable and reduces reliance on
electrical lighting, the significant variability of sunlight throughout the year poses challenges. Fig. 3
illustrates this variability, ranging from summer’s midnight sun to winter's prolonged darkness. Such
fluctuations present difficulties in fenestration placement, shading system control, and management
of artificial lighting assets. Particularly during the highlighted orange timeframe of the year, the
prolonged influence of natural lighting dynamics on human photoreceptors is evident. Exposure to
natural daylight benefits cone cells, sensitive to bright light and colour perception, as well as ganglion
cells, sensitive to blue light, thereby promoting alertness during daytime hours [22].

case study, Library G is in the city of Gothenburg)
6.3 Comparison studies: from different seasons and different libraries
This section utilizes the median function to analyse metrics across three measured categories—visual
parameters (Lux, 𝑅 , and CCT), and non-visual parameters (DUV, SVM, and EML). Based on the results
9
from Table 5.1-5.5, in this section, the Health Status (HS) of parameters is scored on a scale of 1 to 5
for each measurement, with each HS level corresponding to a specific score as detailed in Table 6.1.
The median scores for all parameters are then compiled and presented in the final row of the table.

As detailed in Table 6.2, the results are depicted in Figure 3, which presents data from Library S and
Library C for the months of March and October, represented in blue and orange to signify spring and
autumn, respectively. The average scores from these measurements are also highlighted in green
within the figures.

Fig.3 Radar diagram with median values from the measured visual, non-visual categories
The comparative analysis highlights distinct seasonal variations between the two libraries. While the
differences in measurements between spring and autumn are minimal for Library S, they are more
pronounced in Library C. This variance can largely be attributed to the architectural features of Library
C, which includes extensive glass facades that significantly increase the influence of snow reflection
during March. This finding underscores how human-centric and integrative lighting asset management
strategies can be significantly affected by the physical characteristics of the building, particularly the
presence of large glass areas (as also noted in reference [6]). This seasonal comparison not only reflects
the direct impact of architectural elements on lighting conditions but also emphasizes the need for
adaptive lighting strategies that can accommodate such variations effectively.
The comparative analysis highlights variations among the three libraries. Observing the green lines,
which represent the average measurements, we note distinct differences: For Library S, the lighting
performance is close to the average. In contrast, Library C performs above average, although it dips
below the average in October. This comparison against average levels underscores the disparities
25among libraries. Incorporating more measurements into the analysis provides deeper insights, enabling
library asset managers to make more informed decisions tailored to specific needs at various levels.
6.4 Insights on Energy Efficiency
Typically, the energy efficiency of lighting sources is determined by dividing the declared useful
luminous flux (in Lumens) by the declared on-mode power consumption (in Watts) and then
multiplying by the applicable factor, resulting in ratings from A to G [11]. However, this method does
not fully account for lighting performance or human needs in real indoor environments.
In terms of Lighting Asset Management, it is crucial to achieve an optimal balance between adequate
daylighting and the mitigation of solar heat load to ensure an optimal indoor environment. For instance,
during sunny winter periods, the use of shades to block excessive sunlight while still relying on artificial
lighting can lead to inefficient energy use. Similarly, in sunny summer conditions, excessive solar gain
can compromise thermal comfort, thereby increasing the need for cooling, which in turn raises energy
consumption. These observations are consistent with the qualitative insights from our studies [6],
which are further supported by quantitative measurements presented in Chapter 5.
Swedish sustainable building certification standards, such as Miljöbyggnad [23], address these issues
by incorporating the Solar Heat Load matrix, which quantifies solar heat transmitted through windows
per square meter of floor area. This approach provides facility managers in libraries with a holistic view
of fenestration strategies, shading control, and shading types.
Our case studies suggest that the energy efficiency of human-centric and integrated lighting assets
should be evaluated based not only on energy consumption and individual lighting source’
performance, but also on integrated lighting performance parameters in the real environment, such as
Lux, 𝑅 , CCT, DUV, SVM, and EML. Once the types of lighting sources in a library are established, their
9
energy consumption can be considered constant. However, as the performance of these lighting
parameters degrades over time, so too does the energy efficiency of the lighting assets. This
degradation implies that energy efficiency diminishes over time and can be predicted based on the
integrated degradation of these lighting parameters.
7. Conclusions and Future Research
To address the challenge of managing human-centric and integrative lighting in public libraries,
particularly post-installation, it is crucial to balance complex visual and non-visual light effects. This
study introduces a novel, context-driven Critical Integrative Levels (CIL) approach to tackle these issues.
The main contributions from this study include:
• Identification of Key Parameters and Contexts: We identified critical parameters and contexts
that significantly influence lighting asset management in public libraries, enhancing the
understanding of what factors are most impactful.
• Introduction of MTOE and CIL Framework: We introduced the concept of Mean Time of
Exposure (MTOE) and developed the Critical Integrative Levels (CIL) framework for managing
lighting assets. This approach includes foundational assumptions and illustrative examples,
providing a structured method to address the complexities of lighting management in library
settings.
• Establishment of Context-Specific Thresholds: Utilizing the CIL framework, we established and
defined context-specific thresholds for essential lighting parameters. This development allows
for targeted and effective management strategies tailored to the unique needs of public
libraries.
26• Practical Application of the CIL Framework: The efficacy of the CIL approach was
demonstrated through practical applications in real-world settings. Case studies from three
Swedish libraries showcased how the selected parameters could be optimized to enhance both
functionality and comfort.
• Promotion of Integrative Dialogue: Our study encourages ongoing dialogue regarding the
integration of Equivalent Melanopic Lux (EML) with energy efficiency solutions. This
conversation aims to foster a holistic approach to lighting design that prioritizes human well-
being alongside environmental sustainability.
The study’s findings are pivotal in setting a new precedent for lighting asset management in public
libraries. However, the research is not without its limitations, which include the constraints imposed
by the selected parameters and the foundational assumptions of the CIL framework. The following
areas are identified for further development:
• Integrated Prognosis Approach: Future work will explore the development of an integrated
prognosis approach that combines the CIL framework with advanced digital solutions. This
progression will aim to enhance predictive capabilities and improve maintenance strategies,
making them more proactive and data driven.
• Digital Integration: The potential for incorporating digital solutions such as Digital Twins and
IoT-based monitoring systems will be examined. These technologies promise to revolutionize
how lighting assets are managed, monitored, and maintained over their lifecycle, ensuring
optimal performance and minimal environmental impact.
• Expansion of Parameters and Contexts: Further research will also involve expanding the range
of parameters and contexts considered within the CIL framework to cover more diverse and
comprehensive scenarios. This expansion will likely include more nuanced aspects of human-
centric and integrated lighting and broader environmental considerations.

The term "MacAdam Ellipse" or "MacAdam Step" originates from David Lewis
MacAdam's 1942 research, which established that the human eye cannot
detect color differences within specific ellipses in chromaticity space. These
ellipses measure color deviation with a unit called the "Standard Deviation of
Standard
Colour Matching" (SDCM), also known as "MacAdam SDCM." One SDCM, or
Deviation of
one MacAdam Step, represents the smallest noticeable deviation. A color
Colour Matching
tolerance of 3 SDCM, for instance, indicates that color variations are within
(SDCM)
three MacAdam ellipses, and such differences are typically imperceptible.
This metric is crucial in lighting design and quality control, particularly for
ensuring color consistency across LED lighting, where color output can vary
significantly between units.
CCT is a specification of the colour appearance of the light emitted by a lamp,
relating its colour to the colour of light from a reference source when heated

(2000-3000K) are described as ‘warm’ and have a reddish-yellowish
(CCT)
appearance, while higher CCTs (5000-6500K) are referred to as ‘cool’ and
have a bluish-white appearance.
This is a measure of the deviation of a white light source from the black-body
Colour line in the CIE 1960 colour space. A Duv of zero means the colour point falls
Temperature on the black-body line, indicating that the light source has the purest white
colour corresponding to its CCT. A positive Duv indicates a shift towards
green, while a negative Duv indicates a shift towards magenta. The DUV value
Duv
that is considered acceptable for human perception and application
requirements can vary depending on the context and the specific standards
applied. In general, for most indoor lighting applications where color quality
is important, such as in residential or office settings, a DUV value close to zero
is preferred, typically within the range of -0.003 to +0.003.
This is the rate at which the light output fluctuates. It’s measured in Hertz
Flicker Frequency (Hz). A higher frequency is generally less noticeable and thus less likely to
cause discomfort or health issues.
This measures the amount of fluctuation in light output, usually as a

percentage of the total light output. Higher percentages generally mean the
Percentage
Flicker flicker is more noticeable.
This is a more complex measure that considers both the amplitude and the

waveform of the flicker. It ranges from 0 (no flicker) to 1 (maximum flicker).
SVM (Stroboscopic Visibility Measure) measures the visibility of stroboscopic
SVM effects from temporal light modulation, which can occur when moving
objects are illuminated by a flickering light source.
In a chromaticity diagram, the colour of the light is represented by a point
defined by two (in CIE 1931 or CIE 1960 space) or three (in CIE 1976 space)
Chromaticity chromaticity coordinates. The most used are the x and y coordinates in the
Coordinates CIE 1931 space. For instance, the chromaticity coordinates of the D65
illuminant (representing average daylight) are (0.3127, 0.3290) in the CIE
1931 space.

This is a measure of how well a light source produces visible light. It is
calculated by dividing the luminous flux (in lumens, lm) by the power
