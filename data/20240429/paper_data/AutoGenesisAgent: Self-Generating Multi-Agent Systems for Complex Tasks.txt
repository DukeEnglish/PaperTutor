Abstract
The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) and their integration into multi-agent systems has paved the way for
sophisticated automation in various domains. This paper introduces AutoGenesisAgent, a multi-agent system that
autonomously designs and deploys other multi-agent systems tailored for specific tasks. AutoGenesisAgent comprises several
specialized agents including System Understanding, System Design, Agent Generator, and several others that collectively
manage the lifecycle of creating functional multi-agent systems from initial concept to deployment. Each agent in
AutoGenesisAgent has distinct responsibilities ranging from interpreting input prompts to optimizing system performance,
culminating, in the deployment of a ready-to-use system. This proof-of-concept study discusses the design, implementation,
and lessons learned from developing AutoGenesisAgent, highlighting its capability to generate and refine multi-agent
systems autonomously, thereby reducing the need for extensive human oversight in the initial stages of system design.
