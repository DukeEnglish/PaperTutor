|summary| The training process of Large Language Models LLMs requires extensive textcorpus. However these data are often unevenly distributed in differentlanguages. As a result LLMs perform well on common languages such as EnglishGerman and French but perform poorly on low-resource languages. Howevercurrently there is no work to quantitatively measure the performance of LLMs inlow-resource languages. To fill this gap we proposed the Language Ranker thataims to benchmark and rank different languages according to the performance ofLLMs on those languages. We employ the LLMs performance on the English corpusas a baseline to compare the performances of different languages and English.We have the following three findings: 1. The performance rankings of differentLLMs in all languages are roughly the same. 2. LLMs with different sizes havethe same partial order of performance. 3. There is a strong correlation betweenLlaMa2s performance in different languages and the proportion of thepre-training corpus. These findings illustrate that the Language Ranker can beused as an indicator to measure the language performance of LLMs. |

|summary| In the era of rapid evolution of generative language models within the realmof natural language processing there is an imperative call to revisit andreformulate evaluation methodologies especially in the domain of aspect-basedsentiment analysis ABSA. This paper addresses the emerging challengesintroduced by the generative paradigm which has moderately blurred traditionalboundaries between understanding and generation tasks. Building upon prevailingpractices in the field we analyze the advantages and shortcomings associatedwith the prevalent ABSA evaluation paradigms. Through an in-depth examinationsupplemented by illustrative examples we highlight the intricacies involved inaligning generative outputs with other evaluative metrics specifically thosederived from other tasks including question answering. While we steer clear ofadvocating for a singular and definitive metric our contribution lies inpaving the path for a comprehensive guideline tailored for ABSA evaluations inthis generative paradigm. In this position paper we aim to providepractitioners with profound reflections offering insights and directions thatcan aid in navigating this evolving landscape ensuring evaluations that areboth accurate and reflective of generative capabilities. |

|summary| Adversarial attacks pose significant challenges to deep neural networksDNNs such as Transformer models in natural language processing NLP. Thispaper introduces a novel defense strategy called GenFighter which enhancesadversarial robustness by learning and reasoning on the training classificationdistribution. GenFighter identifies potentially malicious instances deviatingfrom the distribution transforms them into semantically equivalent instancesaligned with the training data and employs ensemble techniques for a unifiedand robust response. By conducting extensive experiments we show thatGenFighter outperforms state-of-the-art defenses in accuracy under attack andattack success rate metrics. Additionally it requires a high number of queriesper attack making the attack more challenging in real scenarios. The ablationstudy shows that our approach integrates transfer learning agenerative/evolutive procedure and an ensemble method providing an effectivedefense against NLP adversarial attacks. |

|summary| Understanding the real world through point cloud video is a crucial aspect ofrobotics and autonomous driving systems. However prevailing methods for 4Dpoint cloud recognition have limitations due to sensor resolution which leadsto a lack of detailed information. Recent advances have shown thatVision-Language Models VLM pre-trained on web-scale text-image datasets canlearn fine-grained visual concepts that can be transferred to variousdownstream tasks. However effectively integrating VLM into the domain of 4Dpoint clouds remains an unresolved problem. In this work we propose theVision-Language Models Goes 4D VG4D framework to transfer VLM knowledge fromvisual-text pre-trained models to a 4D point cloud network. Our approachinvolves aligning the 4D encoders representation with a VLM to learn a sharedvisual and text space from training on large-scale image-text pairs. Bytransferring the knowledge of the VLM to the 4D encoder and combining the VLMour VG4D achieves improved recognition performance. To enhance the 4D encoderwe modernize the classic dynamic point cloud backbone and propose an improvedversion of PSTNet im-PSTNet which can efficiently model point cloud videos.Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performancefor action recognition on both the NTU RGBD 60 dataset and the NTU RGBD 120dataset.

However a persistent challengewithin this domain is the optimization of prompts to effectively conveyabstract concepts into concrete objects. For example text encoders can hardlyexpress peace while can easily illustrate olive branches and white doves.This paper introduces a novel approach named Prompt Optimizer for AbstractConcepts POAC specifically designed to enhance the performance oftext-to-image diffusion models in interpreting and generating images fromabstract concepts. We propose a Prompt Language Model PLM which isinitialized from a pre-trained language model and then fine-tuned with acurated dataset of abstract concept prompts. The dataset is created with GPT-4to extend the abstract concept to a scene and concrete objects. Our frameworkemploys a Reinforcement Learning RL-based optimization strategy focusing onthe alignment between the generated images by a stable diffusion model andoptimized prompts. Through extensive experiments we demonstrate that ourproposed POAC significantly improves the accuracy and aesthetic quality ofgenerated images particularly in the description of abstract concepts andalignment with optimized prompts.

Despite the success ofSelf-Supervised Learning SSL in computer vision its application to HTR hasbeen rather scattered leaving key SSL methodologies unexplored. This workfocuses on one of them namely Spatial Context-based SSL. We investigate howthis family of approaches can be adapted and optimized for HTR and propose newworkflows that leverage the unique features of handwritten text.

|summary| Temporal logics such as linear temporal logic LTL offer a precise meansof specifying tasks for deep reinforcement learning RL agents. In our workwe consider the setting where the task is specified by an LTL objective andthere is an additional scalar reward that we need to optimize. Previous worksfocus either on learning a LTL task-satisfying policy alone or are restrictedto finite state spaces. We make two contributions: First we introduce anRL-friendly approach to this setting by formulating this problem as a singleoptimization objective. Our formulation guarantees that an optimal policy willbe reward-maximal from the set of policies that maximize the likelihood ofsatisfying the LTL specification. Second we address a sparsity issue thatoften arises for LTL-guided Deep RL policies by introducing Cycle ExperienceReplay CyclER a technique that automatically guides RL agents towards thesatisfaction of an LTL specification. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacyof CyclER in finding performant deep RL policies in both continuous anddiscrete experimental domains. |

|summary| Given a factorization of an image into a sum of linear components we presenta zero-shot method to control each individual component through diffusion modelsampling. For example we can decompose an image into low and high spatialfrequencies and condition these components on different text prompts. Thisproduces hybrid images which change appearance depending on viewing distance.By decomposing an image into three frequency subbands we can generate hybridimages with three prompts. We also use a decomposition into grayscale and colorcomponents to produce images whose appearance changes when they are viewed ingrayscale a phenomena that naturally occurs under dim lighting. And we explorea decomposition by a motion blur kernel which produces images that changeappearance under motion blurring. Our method works by denoising with acomposite noise estimate built from the components of noise estimatesconditioned on different prompts. We also show that for certain decompositionsour method recovers prior approaches to compositional generation and spatialcontrol. Finally we show that we can extend our approach to generate hybridimages from real images. We do this by holding one component fixed andgenerating the remaining components effectively solving an inverse problem. |

|summary| Text animation serves as an expressive medium transforming staticcommunication into dynamic experiences by infusing words with motion to evokeemotions emphasize meanings and construct compelling narratives. Craftinganimations that are semantically aware poses significant challenges demandingexpertise in graphic design and animation. We present an automated textanimation scheme termed Dynamic Typography which combines two challengingtasks. It deforms letters to convey semantic meaning and infuses them withvibrant movements based on user prompts. Our technique harnesses vectorgraphics representations and an end-to-end optimization-based framework. Thisframework employs neural displacement fields to convert letters into baseshapes and applies per-frame motion encouraging coherence with the intendedtextual concept. Shape preservation techniques and perceptual lossregularization are employed to maintain legibility and structural integritythroughout the animation process. We demonstrate the generalizability of ourapproach across various text-to-video models and highlight the superiority ofour end-to-end methodology over baseline methods which might comprise separatetasks. Through quantitative and qualitative evaluations we demonstrate theeffectiveness of our framework in generating coherent text animations thatfaithfully interpret user prompts while maintaining readability.

|summary| 3D Gaussians have recently emerged as an efficient representation for novelview synthesis. This work studies its editability with a particular focus onthe inpainting task which aims to supplement an incomplete set of 3D Gaussianswith additional points for visually harmonious rendering. Compared to 2Dinpainting the crux of inpainting 3D Gaussians is to figure out therendering-relevant properties of the introduced points whose optimizationlargely benefits from their initial 3D positions. To this end we propose toguide the point initialization with an image-conditioned depth completionmodel which learns to directly restore the depth map based on the observedimage. Such a design allows our model to fill in depth values at an alignedscale with the original depth and also to harness strong generalizability fromlargescale diffusion prior. Thanks to the more accurate depth completion ourapproach dubbed InFusion surpasses existing alternatives with sufficientlybetter fidelity and efficiency under various complex scenarios. We furtherdemonstrate the effectiveness of InFusion with several practical applicationssuch as inpainting with user-specific texture or with novel object insertion. |

We then present COAR ascalable algorithm for estimating component attributions we demonstrate itseffectiveness across models datasets and modalities. Finally we show thatcomponent attributions estimated with COAR directly enable model editing acrossfive tasks namely: fixing model errors forgetting specific classesboosting subpopulation robustness localizing backdoor attacks and improvingrobustness to typographic attacks.

|summary| Advances in computational power and AI have increased interest inreinforcement learning approaches to inventory management. This paper providesa theoretical foundation for these approaches and investigates the benefits ofrestricting to policy structures that are well-established by decades ofinventory theory. In particular we prove generalization guarantees forlearning several well-known classes of inventory policies including base-stockand s S policies by leveraging the celebrated Vapnik-Chervonenkis VCtheory. We apply the concepts of the Pseudo-dimension and Fat-shatteringdimension from VC theory to determine the generalizability of inventorypolicies that is the difference between an inventory policys performance ontraining data and its expected performance on unseen data. We focus on aclassical setting without contexts but allow for an arbitrary distributionover demand sequences and do not make any assumptions such as independence overtime. We corroborate our supervised learning results using numericalsimulations.  Managerially our theory and simulations translate to the following insights.First there is a principle of learning less is more in inventory management:depending on the amount of data available it may be beneficial to restrictoneself to a simpler albeit suboptimal class of inventory policies tominimize overfitting errors. Second the number of parameters in a policy classmay not be the correct measure of overfitting error: in fact the class ofpolicies defined by T time-varying base-stock levels exhibits a generalizationerror comparable to that of the two-parameter s S policy class. Finally ourresearch suggests situations in which it could be beneficial to incorporate theconcepts of base-stock and inventory position into black-box learning machinesinstead of having these machines directly learn the order quantity actions. |

Chen-Epperly-Tropp-Webbershowed among many other things that the randomly pivoted partial Choleskyalgorithm that chooses the i-th row with probability proportional to thediagonal entry A_ii leads to a universal contraction of the trace norm theSchatten 1-norm in expectation for each step. We show that if one chooses thei-th row with likelihood proportional to A_ii2 one obtains the sameresult in the Frobenius norm the Schatten 2-norm. Implications for the greedypivoting rule and pivot selection strategies are discussed. |

|summary| In some fields of AI machine learning and statistics the validation of newmethods and algorithms is often hindered by the scarcity of suitable real-worlddatasets. Researchers must often turn to simulated data which yields limitedinformation about the applicability of the proposed methods to real problems.As a step forward we have constructed two devices that allow us to quickly andinexpensively produce large datasets from non-trivial but well-understoodphysical systems. The devices which we call causal chambers arecomputer-controlled laboratories that allow us to manipulate and measure anarray of variables from these physical systems providing a rich testbed foralgorithms from a variety of fields. We illustrate potential applicationsthrough a series of case studies in fields such as causal discoveryout-of-distribution generalization change point detection independentcomponent analysis and symbolic regression. For applications to causalinference the chambers allow us to carefully perform interventions. We alsoprovide and empirically validate a causal model of each chamber which can beused as ground truth for different tasks. All hardware and software is madeopen source and the datasets are publicly available at causalchamber.org orthrough the Python package causalchamber. |

|summary| The ubiquity and on-the-go availability of mobile devices makes them centralto many tasks such as interpersonal communication and media consumption.However despite the potential of mobile devices for on-demand exploratory datavisualization existing mobile interactions are difficult often using highlycustom interactions complex gestures or multi-modal input. We synthesizelimitations from the literature and outline four motivating principles forimproved mobile interaction: leverage ubiquitous modalities prioritizediscoverability enable rapid in-context data exploration and promote gracefulrecovery. We then contribute thirteen interaction candidates and conduct aformative study with twelve participants who experienced our interactions in atestbed prototype. Based on these interviews we discuss design considerationsand tradeoffs from four main themes: precise and rapid inspection focusednavigation single-touch and fixed orientation interaction and judicious useof motion. |

|summary| Privacy is a human right. It ensures that individuals are free to engage indiscussions participate in groups and form relationships online or offlinewithout fear of their data being inappropriately harvested analyzed orotherwise used to harm them. Preserving privacy has emerged as a criticalfactor in research particularly in the computational social science CSSartificial intelligence AI and data science domains given their reliance onindividuals data for novel insights. The increasing use of advancedcomputational models stands to exacerbate privacy concerns because ifinappropriately used they can quickly infringe privacy rights and lead toadverse effects for individuals - especially vulnerable groups - and society.We have already witnessed a host of privacy issues emerge with the advent oflarge language models LLMs such as ChatGPT which further demonstrate theimportance of embedding privacy from the start. This article contributes to thefield by discussing the role of privacy and the primary issues that researchersworking in CSS AI data science and related domains are likely to face. Itthen presents several key considerations for researchers to ensure participantprivacy is best preserved in their research design data collection and useanalysis and dissemination of research results. |

|summary| This paper introduces a relational perspective on ethics within the contextof Feminist Digital Civics and community-led design. Ethics work in HCI hasprimarily focused on prescriptive machine ethics and bioethics principlesrather than people. In response we advocate for a community-led processualapproach to ethics acknowledging power dynamics and local contexts. We thuspropose a multidimensional adaptive model for ethics in HCI design integratingan intersectional feminist ethical lens. This framework embraces feministepistemologies methods and methodologies fostering a reflexive practice. Byweaving together situated knowledges standpoint theory intersectionalityparticipatory methods and care ethics our approach offers a holisticfoundation for ethics in HCI aiming to advance community-led practices andenrich the discourse surrounding ethics within this field. |

|summary| Multitasking with a touch screen user-interface while driving is known toimpact negatively driving performance and safety. Literature shows that listscrolling interfaces generate more visual-manual distraction than structuredmenus and sequential navigation. Depth and breadth trade-offs for structurednavigation have been studied. However little is known on how secondary taskcharacteristics interact with those trade-offs. In this study we make thehypothesis that both menus depth and task complexity interact in generatingvisual-manual distraction. Using a driving simulation setup we collectedtelemetry and eye-tracking data to evaluate driving performance. Participantswere multitasking with a mobile app presenting a range of eight depth andbreadth trade-offs under three types of secondary tasks involving differentcognitive operations Systematic reading Search for an item Memorize itemsstate. The results confirm our hypothesis. Systematic interaction with menuitems generated a visual demand that increased with menus depth while visualdemand reach an optimum for Search and Memory tasks. We discuss implicationsfor design: In a multitasking context display design effectiveness must beassessed while considering menus layout but also cognitive processes involved. |

|summary| Satellite imagery is regarded as a great opportunity for citizen-basedmonitoring of activities of interest. Relevant imagery may however not beavailable at sufficiently high resolution quality or cadence -- let alone beuniformly accessible to open-source analysts. This limits an assessment of thetrue long-term potential of citizen-based monitoring of nuclear activitiesusing publicly available satellite imagery. In this article we demonstrate howmodern game engines combined with advanced machine-learning techniques can beused to generate synthetic imagery of sites of interest with the ability tochoose relevant parameters upon request these include time of day cloudcover season or level of activity onsite. At the same time resolution andoff-nadir angle can be adjusted to simulate different characteristics of thesatellite. While there are several possible use-cases for synthetic imageryhere we focus on its usefulness to support tabletop exercises in which simplemonitoring scenarios can be examined to better understand verificationcapabilities enabled by new satellite constellations and very short revisittimes. |

|summary| This paper considers a distributed adaptive optimization problem where allagents only have access to their local cost functions with a common unknownparameter whereas they mean to collaboratively estimate the true parameter andfind the optimal solution over a connected network. A general mathematicalframework for such a problem has not been studied yet. We aim to providevaluable insights for addressing parameter uncertainty in distributedoptimization problems and simultaneously find the optimal solution. Thus wepropose a novel Prediction while Optimization scheme which utilizesdistributed fractional Bayesian learning through weighted averaging on thelog-beliefs to update the beliefs of unknown parameters and distributedgradient descent for renewing the estimation of the optimal solution. Thenunder suitable assumptions we prove that all agents beliefs and decisionvariables converge almost surely to the true parameter and the optimal solutionunder the true parameter respectively. We further establish a sublinearconvergence rate for the belief sequence. Finally numerical experiments areimplemented to corroborate the theoretical analysis. |

|updated| 2024-04-17 13:08:49 UTC |
|summary| This paper considers the problem of conflict-free distribution of agents on acircular periphery encompassing all agents. The two key elements of theproposed policy include the construction of a set of convex layers nestedconvex polygons using the initial positions of the agents and a novel searchspace region for each of the agents. The search space for an agent on a convexlayer is defined as the region enclosed between the lines passing through theagents position and normal to its supporting edges. Guaranteeingcollision-free paths a goal assignment policy designates a unique goalposition within the search space of an agent. In contrast to the existingliterature this work presents a one-shot collision-free solution to thecircular distribution problem by utilizing only the initial positions of theagents. Illustrative examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposedpolicy. |

|summary| Policy-Space Response Oracles PSRO as a general algorithmic framework hasachieved state-of-the-art performance in learning equilibrium policies oftwo-player zero-sum games. However the hand-crafted hyperparameter valueselection in most of the existing works requires extensive domain knowledgeforming the main barrier to applying PSRO to different games. In this work wemake the first attempt to investigate the possibility of self-adaptivelydetermining the optimal hyperparameter values in the PSRO framework. Ourcontributions are three-fold: 1 Using several hyperparameters we propose aparametric PSRO that unifies the gradient descent ascent GDA and differentPSRO variants. 2 We propose the self-adaptive PSRO SPSRO by casting thehyperparameter value selection of the parametric PSRO as a hyperparameteroptimization HPO problem where our objective is to learn an HPO policy thatcan self-adaptively determine the optimal hyperparameter values during therunning of the parametric PSRO. 3 To overcome the poor performance of onlineHPO methods we propose a novel offline HPO approach to optimize the HPO policybased on the Transformer architecture. Experiments on various two-playerzero-sum games demonstrate the superiority of SPSRO over different baselines. |

|summary| Traffic signal control systems TSCSs are integral to intelligent trafficmanagement fostering efficient vehicle flow. Traditional approaches oftensimplify road networks into standard graphs which results in a failure toconsider the dynamic nature of traffic data at neighboring intersectionsthereby neglecting higher-order interconnections necessary for real-timecontrol. To address this we propose a novel TSCS framework to realizeintelligent traffic control. This framework collaborates with multipleneighboring edge computing servers to collect traffic information across theroad network. To elevate the efficiency of traffic signal control we havecrafted a multi-agent soft actor-critic MA-SAC reinforcement learningalgorithm. Within this algorithm individual agents are deployed at eachintersection with a mandate to optimize traffic flow across the entire roadnetwork collectively. Furthermore we introduce hypergraph learning into thecritic network of MA-SAC to enable the spatio-temporal interactions frommultiple intersections in the road network. This method fuses hypergraph andspatio-temporal graph structures to encode traffic data and capture the complexspatial and temporal correlations between multiple intersections. Our empiricalevaluation tested on varied datasets demonstrates the superiority of ourframework in minimizing average vehicle travel times and sustaininghigh-throughput performance. This work facilitates the development of moreintelligent and reactive urban traffic management solutions. |

|summary| Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning MARL necessitates seamlesscollaboration among agents often represented by an underlying relation graph.Existing methods for learning this graph primarily focus on agent-pairrelations neglecting higher-order relationships. While several approachesattempt to extend cooperation modelling to encompass behaviour similaritieswithin groups they commonly fall short in concurrently learning the latentgraph thereby constraining the information exchange among partially observedagents. To overcome these limitations we present a novel approach to infer theGroup-Aware Coordination Graph GACG which is designed to capture both thecooperation between agent pairs based on current observations and group-leveldependencies from behaviour patterns observed across trajectories. This graphis further used in graph convolution for information exchange between agentsduring decision-making. To further ensure behavioural consistency among agentswithin the same group we introduce a group distance loss which promotes groupcohesion and encourages specialization between groups. Our evaluationsconducted on StarCraft II micromanagement tasks demonstrate GACGs superiorperformance. An ablation study further provides experimental evidence of theeffectiveness of each component of our method. |
