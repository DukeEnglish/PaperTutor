|summary| Several companies--such as Google Microsoft and OpenAI--have deployedtechniques to watermark AI-generated content to enable proactive detection.However existing literature mainly focuses on user-agnostic detection.Attribution aims to further trace back the user of a generative-AI service whogenerated a given content detected as AI-generated. Despite its growingimportance attribution is largely unexplored. In this work we aim to bridgethis gap by providing the first systematic study on watermark-based user-awaredetection and attribution of AI-generated content. Specifically wetheoretically study the detection and attribution performance via rigorousprobabilistic analysis. Moreover we develop an efficient algorithm to selectwatermarks for the users to enhance attribution performance. Both ourtheoretical and empirical results show that watermark-based detection andattribution inherit the accuracy and non-robustness properties of thewatermarking method. |

A variety of T2I faithfulnessmetrics have been proposed leveraging advances in cross-modal embeddings andvision-language models VLMs. However these metrics are not rigorouslycompared and benchmarked instead presented against few weak baselines bycorrelation to human Likert scores over a set of easy-to-discriminate images.  We introduce T2IScoreScore TS2 a curated set of semantic error graphscontaining a prompt and a set increasingly erroneous images. These allow us torigorously judge whether a given prompt faithfulness metric can correctly orderimages with respect to their objective error count and significantlydiscriminate between different error nodes using meta-metric scores derivedfrom established statistical tests. Surprisingly we find that thestate-of-the-art VLM-based metrics e.g. TIFA DSG LLMScore VIEScore wetested fail to significantly outperform simple feature-based metrics likeCLIPScore particularly on a hard subset of naturally-occurring T2I modelerrors. TS2 will enable the development of better T2I prompt faithfulnessmetrics through more rigorous comparison of their conformity to expectedorderings and separations under objective criteria. |

|summary| The rapid progress of large language models LLMs has seen them excel andfrequently surpass human performance on standard benchmarks. This has enabledmany downstream applications such as LLM agents to rely on theirsophisticated reasoning to navigate complex task requirements. However LLMsare known to unexpectedly falter in simple tasks and under seeminglystraightforward circumstances - underscoring the need for better and morediverse evaluation setups to measure their true capabilities. To this end wechoose to study compositional and conditional reasoning two cornerstones ofhuman cognition and introduce GroundCocoa - a lexically diverse benchmarkconnecting these reasoning skills to the real-world problem of flight booking.Our task involves aligning detailed user preferences with available flightoptions presented in a multiple-choice format. Results indicate a significantdisparity in performance among current state-of-the-art LLMs with even the bestperforming model GPT-4 Turbo not exceeding 67 accuracy despite advancedprompting techniques. |

|summary| Methods for learning latent user representations from historical behaviorlogs have gained traction for recommendation tasks in e-commerce contentstreaming and other settings. However this area still remains relativelyunderexplored in video and mobile gaming contexts. In this work we present anovel method for overcoming this limitation by extending a long-rangeTransformer model from the natural language processing domain to playerbehavior data. We discuss specifics of behavior tracking in games and proposepreprocessing and tokenization approaches by viewing in-game events in ananalogous way to words in sentences thus enabling learning playerrepresentations in a self-supervised manner in the absence of ground-truthannotations. We experimentally demonstrate the efficacy of the proposedapproach in fitting the distribution of behavior events by evaluating intrinsiclanguage modeling metrics. Furthermore we qualitatively analyze the emergingstructure of the learned embedding space and show its value for generatinginsights into behavior patterns to inform downstream applications. |

|summary| Recent reinforcement learning approaches have shown surprisingly strongcapabilities of bang-bang policies for solving continuous control benchmarks.The underlying coarse action space discretizations often yield favourableexploration characteristics while final performance does not visibly suffer inthe absence of action penalization in line with optimal control theory. Inrobotics applications smooth control signals are commonly preferred to reducesystem wear and energy efficiency but action costs can be detrimental toexploration during early training. In this work we aim to bridge thisperformance gap by growing discrete action spaces from coarse to fine controlresolution taking advantage of recent results in decoupled Q-learning to scaleour approach to high-dimensional action spaces up to dimA  38. Our workindicates that an adaptive control resolution in combination with valuedecomposition yields simple critic-only algorithms that yield surprisinglystrong performance on continuous control tasks. |

|summary| Text-to-image diffusion models have shown remarkable success in generating apersonalized subject based on a few reference images. However current methodsstruggle with handling multiple subjects simultaneously often resulting inmixed identities with combined attributes from different subjects. In thiswork we present MuDI a novel framework that enables multi-subjectpersonalization by effectively decoupling identities from multiple subjects.Our main idea is to utilize segmented subjects generated by the SegmentAnything Model for both training and inference as a form of data augmentationfor training and initialization for the generation process. Our experimentsdemonstrate that MuDI can produce high-quality personalized images withoutidentity mixing even for highly similar subjects as shown in Figure 1. Inhuman evaluation MuDI shows twice as many successes for personalizing multiplesubjects without identity mixing over existing baselines and is preferred over70 compared to the strongest baseline.

|summary| We study the geometry of conditional optimal transport COT and prove adynamical formulation which generalizes the Benamou-Brenier Theorem. With thesetools we propose a simulation-free flow-based method for conditionalgenerative modeling. Our method couples an arbitrary source distribution to aspecified target distribution through a triangular COT plan. We build on theframework of flow matching to train a conditional generative model byapproximating the geodesic path of measures induced by this COT plan. Ourtheory and methods are applicable in the infinite-dimensional setting makingthem well suited for inverse problems. Empirically we demonstrate our proposedmethod on two image-to-image translation tasks and an infinite-dimensionalBayesian inverse problem. |

|summary| Multi-modal semantic segmentation significantly enhances AI agentsperception and scene understanding especially under adverse conditions likelow-light or overexposed environments. Leveraging additional modalitiesX-modality like thermal and depth alongside traditional RGB providescomplementary information enabling more robust and reliable segmentation. Inthis work we introduce Sigma a Siamese Mamba network for multi-modal semanticsegmentation utilizing the Selective Structured State Space Model Mamba.Unlike conventional methods that rely on CNNs with their limited localreceptive fields or Vision Transformers ViTs which offer global receptivefields at the cost of quadratic complexity our model achieves global receptivefields coverage with linear complexity. By employing a Siamese encoder andinnovating a Mamba fusion mechanism we effectively select essentialinformation from different modalities. A decoder is then developed to enhancethe channel-wise modeling ability of the model. Our method Sigma isrigorously evaluated on both RGB-Thermal and RGB-Depth segmentation tasksdemonstrating its superiority and marking the first successful application ofState Space Models SSMs in multi-modal perception tasks.

|summary| Existing unsupervised deformable image registration methods usually rely onmetrics applied to the gradients of predicted displacement or velocity fieldsas a regularization term to ensure transformation smoothness which potentiallylimits registration accuracy. In this study we propose a novel approach toenhance unsupervised deformable image registration by introducing a newdifferential operator into the registration framework. This operator acting onthe velocity field and mapping it to a dual space ensures the smoothness ofthe velocity field during optimization facilitating accurate deformableregistration. In addition to tackle the challenge of capturing largedeformations inside image pairs we introduce a Cross-Coordinate Attentionmodule CCA and embed it into a proposed Fully Convolutional NetworksFCNs-based multi-resolution registration architecture. Evaluation experimentsare conducted on two magnetic resonance imaging MRI datasets. Compared tovarious state-of-the-art registration approaches including a traditionalalgorithm and three representative unsupervised learning-based methods ourmethod achieves superior accuracies maintaining desirable diffeomorphicproperties and exhibiting promising registration speed. |

|summary| We introduce Score identity Distillation SiD an innovative data-freemethod that distills the generative capabilities of pretrained diffusion modelsinto a single-step generator. SiD not only facilitates an exponentially fastreduction in Frechet inception distance FID during distillation but alsoapproaches or even exceeds the FID performance of the original teacherdiffusion models. By reformulating forward diffusion processes as semi-implicitdistributions we leverage three score-related identities to create aninnovative loss mechanism. This mechanism achieves rapid FID reduction bytraining the generator using its own synthesized images eliminating the needfor real data or reverse-diffusion-based generation all accomplished withinsignificantly shortened generation time. Upon evaluation across four benchmarkdatasets the SiD algorithm demonstrates high iteration efficiency duringdistillation and surpasses competing distillation approaches whether they areone-step or few-step data-free or dependent on training data in terms ofgeneration quality. This achievement not only redefines the benchmarks forefficiency and effectiveness in diffusion distillation but also in the broaderfield of diffusion-based generation. Our PyTorch implementation will bepublicly accessible on GitHub. |

|updated| 2024-04-05 07:02:10 UTC |
|summary| Community detection in multi-layer networks has emerged as a crucial area ofmodern network analysis. However conventional approaches often assume thatnodes belong exclusively to a single community which fails to capture thecomplex structure of real-world networks where nodes may belong to multiplecommunities simultaneously. To address this limitation we propose novelspectral methods to estimate the common mixed memberships in the multi-layermixed membership stochastic block model. The proposed methods leverage theeigen-decomposition of three aggregate matrices: the sum of adjacency matricesthe debiased sum of squared adjacency matrices and the sum of squaredadjacency matrices. We establish rigorous theoretical guarantees for theconsistency of our methods. Specifically we derive per-node error rates undermild conditions on network sparsity demonstrating their consistency as thenumber of nodes and/or layers increases under the multi-layer mixed membershipstochastic block model. Our theoretical results reveal that the methodleveraging the sum of adjacency matrices generally performs poorer than theother two methods for mixed membership estimation in multi-layer networks. Weconduct extensive numerical experiments to empirically validate our theoreticalfindings. For real-world multi-layer networks with unknown communityinformation we introduce two novel modularity metrics to quantify the qualityof mixed membership community detection. Finally we demonstrate the practicalapplications of our algorithms and modularity metrics by applying them toreal-world multi-layer networks demonstrating their effectiveness inextracting meaningful community structures. |

|summary| We present a nonparametric construction for deep learning compatible modernHopfield models and utilize this framework to debut an efficient variant. Ourkey contribution stems from interpreting the memory storage and retrievalprocesses in modern Hopfield models as a nonparametric regression problemsubject to a set of query-memory pairs. Crucially our framework not onlyrecovers the known results from the original dense modern Hopfield model butalso fills the void in the literature regarding efficient modern Hopfieldmodels by introducing textitsparse-structured modern Hopfield models withsub-quadratic complexity. We establish that this sparse model inherits theappealing theoretical properties of its dense analogue -- connection withtransformer attention fixed point convergence and exponential memory capacity-- even without knowing details of the Hopfield energy function. Additionallywe showcase the versatility of our framework by constructing a family of modernHopfield models as extensions including linear random masked top-K andpositive random feature modern Hopfield models. Empirically we validate theefficacy of our framework in both synthetic and realistic settings. |

|summary| This paper considers the problem of regression analysis with randomcovariance matrix as outcome and Euclidean covariates in the framework ofFrechet regression on the Bures-Wasserstein manifold. Such regressionproblems have many applications in single cell genomics and neuroscience wherewe have covariance matrix measured over a large set of samples. Frechetregression on the Bures-Wasserstein manifold is formulated as estimating theconditional Frechet mean given covariates x. A non-asymptoticsqrtn-rate of convergence up to log n factors is obtained for ourestimator hatQ_nx uniformly for leftxright lesssim sqrtlogn which is crucial for deriving the asymptotic null distribution and powerof our proposed statistical test for the null hypothesis of no association. Inaddition a central limit theorem for the point estimate hatQ_nx isobtained giving insights to a test for covariate effects. The nulldistribution of the test statistic is shown to converge to a weighted sum ofindependent chi-squares which implies that the proposed test has the desiredsignificance level asymptotically. Also the power performance of the test isdemonstrated against a sequence of contiguous alternatives. Simulation resultsshow the accuracy of the asymptotic distributions. The proposed methods areapplied to a single cell gene expression data set that shows the change of geneco-expression network as people age. |

|summary| Convergence analysis of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods in high-dimensionalstatistical applications is increasingly recognized. In this paper we developgeneral mixing time bounds for Metropolis-Hastings algorithms on discretespaces by building upon and refining some recent theoretical advancements inBayesian model selection problems. We establish sufficient conditions for aclass of informed Metropolis-Hastings algorithms to attain relaxation timesthat are independent of the problem dimension. These conditions are grounded inhigh-dimensional statistical theory and allow for possibly multimodal posteriordistributions. We obtain our results through two independent techniques: themulticommodity flow method and single-element drift condition analysis we findthat the latter yields a tighter mixing time bound. Our results and prooftechniques are readily applicable to a broad spectrum of statistical problemswith discrete parameter spaces. |

|summary| Robots are being designed to help people in an increasing variety ofsettings--but seemingly little attention has been given so far to the specificneeds of women who represent roughly half of the worlds population but arehighly underrepresented in robotics. Here we used a speculative prototypingapproach to explore this expansive design space: First we identified somepotential challenges of interest including crimes and illnesses thatdisproportionately affect women as well as potential opportunities fordesigners which were visualized in five sketches. Then one of the sketchedscenarios was further explored by developing a prototype of a robotic helperdrone equipped with computer vision to detect hidden cameras that could be usedto spy on women. While object detection introduced some errors hidden cameraswere identified with a reasonable accuracy of 80 Intersection over UnionIoU score: 0.40. Our aim is that the identified challenges and opportunitiescould help spark discussion and inspire designers toward realizing a safermore inclusive future through responsible use of technology. |

|summary| Sports visualization has developed into an active research field over thelast decades. Many approaches focus on analyzing movement data recorded fromunstructured situations such as soccer. For the analysis of choreographedactivities like formation dancing however the goal differs as dancers followspecific formations in coordinated movement trajectories. To date little workexists on how visual analytics methods can support such choreographedperformances. To fill this gap we introduce a new visual approach for planningand assessing dance choreographies. In terms of planning choreographies wecontribute a web application with interactive authoring tools and views for thedancers positions and orientations movement trajectories poses dance floorutilization and movement distances. For assessing dancers real-world movementtrajectories extracted by manual bounding box annotations we developed atimeline showing aggregated trajectory deviations and a dance floor view fordetailed trajectory comparison. Our approach was developed and evaluated incollaboration with dance instructors showing that introducing visual analyticsinto this domain promises improvements in training efficiency for the future. |

|summary| Demand forecasts are the crucial basis for numerous business decisionsranging from inventory management to strategic facility planning. While machinelearning ML approaches offer accuracy gains their interpretability andacceptance are notoriously lacking. Addressing this dilemma we introduceHierarchical Neural Additive Models for time series HNAM. HNAM expands uponNeural Additive Models NAM by introducing a time-series specific additivemodel with a level and interacting covariate components.  Covariate interactions are only allowed according to a user-specifiedinteraction hierarchy. For example weekday effects may be estimatedindependently of other covariates whereas a holiday effect may depend on theweekday and an additional promotion may depend on both former covariates thatare lower in the interaction hierarchy.  Thereby HNAM yields an intuitive forecasting interface in which analysts canobserve the contribution for each known covariate. We evaluate the proposedapproach and benchmark its performance against other state-of-the-art machinelearning and statistical models extensively on real-world retail data. Theresults reveal that HNAM offers competitive prediction performance whilstproviding plausible explanations. |

|summary| Effective multi-agent collaboration is imperative for solving complexdistributed problems. In this context two key challenges must be addressed:first autonomously identifying optimal objectives for collective outcomessecond aligning these objectives among agents. Traditional frameworks oftenreliant on centralized learning struggle with scalability and efficiency inlarge multi-agent systems. To overcome these issues we introduce adecentralized state-based value learning algorithm that enables agents toindependently discover optimal states. Furthermore we introduce a novelmechanism for multi-agent interaction wherein less proficient agents followand adopt policies from more experienced ones thereby indirectly guiding theirlearning process. Our theoretical analysis shows that our approach leadsdecentralized agents to an optimal collective policy. Empirical experimentsfurther demonstrate that our method outperforms existing decentralizedstate-based and action-based value learning strategies by effectivelyidentifying and aligning optimal objectives. |

|summary| The rapid growth of electric vehicles EVs is driving the expansion ofcharging infrastructure globally. This expansion however places significantcharging demand on the electricity grid impacting grid operations andelectricity pricing. While coordination among all charging stations isbeneficial it may not be always feasible. However a subset of chargingstations which could be jointly operated by a company could coordinate todecide their charging profile. In this paper we investigate whether suchcoalitions between charging stations is better than no coordination.  We model EV charging as a non-cooperative aggregative game where eachstations cost is determined by both monetary payments tied to reactiveelectricity prices on the grid and its sensitivity to deviations from a nominalcharging profile. We consider a solution concept that we callmathcalC-Nash equilibrium which is tied to a coalition mathcalC ofcharging stations coordinating to reduce their cumulative costs. We providesufficient conditions in terms of the demand and sensitivity of chargingstations to determine when independent uncoordinated operation of chargingstations could result in lower overall costs to charging stations thecoalition and charging stations outside the coalition. Somewhat counter tointuition we demonstrate scenarios where allowing charging stations to operateindependently is better than coordinating as a coalition. Jointly theseresults provide operators of charging stations insights into how to coordinatetheir charging behavior and open several research directions. |

|summary| The rise of multi-agent systems especially the success of multi-agentreinforcement learning MARL is reshaping our future across diverse domainslike autonomous vehicle networks. However MARL still faces significantchallenges particularly in achieving zero-shot scalability which allowstrained MARL models to be directly applied to unseen tasks with varying numbersof agents. In addition real-world multi-agent systems usually contain agentswith different functions and strategies while the existing scalable MARLmethods only have limited heterogeneity. To address this we propose a novelMARL framework named Scalable and Heterogeneous Proximal Policy OptimizationSHPPO integrating heterogeneity into parameter-shared PPO-based MARLnetworks. we first leverage a latent network to adaptively learn strategypatterns for each agent. Second we introduce a heterogeneous layer fordecision-making whose parameters are specifically generated by the learnedlatent variables. Our approach is scalable as all the parameters are sharedexcept for the heterogeneous layer and gains both inter-individual andtemporal heterogeneity at the same time. We implement our approach based on thestate-of-the-art backbone PPO-based algorithm as SHPPO while our approach isagnostic to the backbone and can be seamlessly plugged into anyparameter-shared MARL method. SHPPO exhibits superior performance over thebaselines such as MAPPO and HAPPO in classic MARL environments like StarcraftMulti-Agent Challenge SMAC and Google Research Football GRF showcasingenhanced zero-shot scalability and offering insights into the learned latentrepresentations impact on team performance by visualization. |

|summary| We introduce the Laser Learning Environment LLE a collaborativemulti-agent reinforcement learning environment in which coordination iscentral. In LLE agents depend on each other to make progressinterdependence must jointly take specific sequences of actions to succeedperfect coordination and accomplishing those joint actions does not yieldany intermediate reward zero-incentive dynamics. The challenge of suchproblems lies in the difficulty of escaping state space bottlenecks caused byinterdependence steps since escaping those bottlenecks is not rewarded. We testmultiple state-of-the-art value-based MARL algorithms against LLE and show thatthey consistently fail at the collaborative task because of their inability toescape state space bottlenecks even though they successfully achieve perfectcoordination. We show that Q-learning extensions such as prioritized experiencereplay and n-steps return hinder exploration in environments withzero-incentive dynamics and find that intrinsic curiosity with random networkdistillation is not sufficient to escape those bottlenecks. We demonstrate theneed for novel methods to solve this problem and the relevance of LLE ascooperative MARL benchmark. |
